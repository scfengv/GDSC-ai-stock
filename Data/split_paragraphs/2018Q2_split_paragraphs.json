        "paragraph": "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Tesla Q2 2018 Financial Results and Q&A WebcastCall. As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director ofInvestor Relations. Mr. Viecha, you may begin.Martin ViechaThank you very much, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2018Q&A Webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk; J.B. Straubel; Deepak Ahuja; Robin Ren, our Head of Sales;Jerome Guillen, our VP of Trucks; and we also have our autopilot team with us here; Andrej Karpathy,Director of AI; Stuart Bowers, our VP of Engineering; and Pete Bannon, our Director of Silicon Engineering.Our Q2 results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differmaterially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filingswith the SEC. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectHi, thank you for joining. First of all, I'd like to say, we're incredibly proud of the Tesla team for producing7,000 Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles in the last week of June. Those were amazing efforts. Sohonored to work with such great team to fuse that incredible result. It's like mind-blowing. We continuedto achieve 5,000 Model 3s per week, 7,000 combined S, X and 3, multiple weeks in July, showing thatwe're able to do this on a sustained basis. And we expect to, in the absence of a force majeure or somevery unexpected events, be able to achieve an average of 5,000 Model 3s or above for Q3, and 2,000Model 3, Model S, X or above per week for Q3 as well. So essentially, 7,000 cars a week, plus for -- onaverage for Q3. So it's an amazing jump from only a year ago when we're producing 2,000 vehicles aweek. It's really kind of a mind-blowing leap forward for a manufacturing company. So yes, it's incrediblework by the team to do that. Many, many late nights, weekends, extreme amounts of effort and lots ofsmart ideas."

        "paragraph": "It's amazing.The results you're seeing is that the Model 3 market share has surpassed all competitor premium, mid-sized sedans combined. So Model 3 market share is now a majority. July was a majority of all premiumsedans. That trend is, we think, likely to continue. So it's not -- we do not think it will stop there. I haveRobin Ren here, who's our worldwide Head of Sales, to talk about some of the interesting elements thatwe're seeing in terms of cars that people are trading in, the sales and demand trends. It's looking really,really positive.We're also getting great feedback from Model 3 from our customers, and we're now delivering theperformance dual-motor and all-wheel drive versions. And the Model 3 reviews are outstanding, reallycouldn't ask for better reviews from some of the toughest critics in the world. And it's -- yes, and just thething that we're recognizing is that the more Model 3s we deliver to the field, it's actually causing viralgrowth of our sales. So we deliver our Model 3 to somebody, they love it, they tell all their friends, theyare actually -- really, our customers are our primary sales force. They love their car and take their friendsfor a drive, and that's the thing that fundamentally drives our sales. 5But not everyone has Model 3, obviously, so we need to get the cars out there for test drives. As it is rightnow, not even all stores in North America have Model 3 for test drives. Of course, we prioritize gettingcars to customers, but we're soon going to have Model 3s available for test drives in all stores, and boththe performance version and the rear-wheel drive version. So a lot of people who will not buy a car untilthey test drive it, just not unreasonable. Although on Sunday, when I delivered it, testing out like directdelivery, which I think is definitely the future, direct delivery from factory to customer's home or work orwherever they are. The guy here who bought it have never actually even sat in a Model 3. I'm like, wow,okay, Mr. Raul, how do you feel about the car now? You haven't even driven it. He's like, \"I love it. It'samazing.\" So yes, it seems to be really well-received.Yes, so I'd approximate 7,000 cars a week."

        "paragraph": "We believe we can be sustainably profitable from Q3 onwards.We'll try to raise that rate of Model 3 production steadily in the coming quarters and try to get to the10,000 cars a week number as soon we can. What we've found, as we spent a lot of time debugginga wide range manufacturer issues, is that the potential for our existing lines to be able to produce farmore cars is much greater than expected. That by simplifying production lines, by speeding them up, by,in some cases, having things being done manually instead of automatic, and in other cases having bedone automatic instead of manual, we've been able to achieve dramatic improvements to the output ofexisting lines, which means that our CapEx growing from 5,000 cars a week to 10,000 cars a week is atiny fraction. CapEx going 5,000 to 10,000 is a tiny fraction to CapEx needing to grow from 0 to 5,000Model 3s. This is, I think, very good news for capital efficiency of the company. And [indiscernible] that'sgoing to inform future mass market vehicles that we produce.So -- and from an operating plan standpoint, from Q3 onwards, we're going to emphasize, our goal isto be profitable and cash flow positive for every quarter going forward. Now obviously, if there's a bigrecession or there's a severe force majeure event that interrupts the supply chain, that's not alwayspossible. But we're confident that -- and provided the economy is roughly where it is today, reasonablygood and there's not a big force majeure event that we -- I feel comfortable achieving the GAAP incomepositive and cash flow positive quarter every quarter from here on out. It's -- I'll just say, there may beoccasional quarters where we'll pay back a big loan or something where there may be -- just because wepaid back a big loan. But absent that, we'd be cash flow positive.So once again, I thank the team for their incredible work and our customers for their support. Withoutthe great people we have at Tesla and the customers who put their faith in us by buying our product, wewould not be here today. And yes, I've really never been more excited about the future of Tesla. We havea super exciting set of products to bring out in the future. And yes, I mean, sorry if I sound a little tired,I've been working like crazy in the body shop lately."

        "paragraph": "But it's really going great. I'm super excited. Somegood people. And a number of the executive team are here. If I could ask the 3 key leaders of the Teslaautopilot team to be here. So I'd like to go from here to see if autopilot leaders at Tesla could introducethemselves and say a bit about what you're working on, what you're excited about in the future. Sorry toput you guys in the spot. But I think we're making pretty radical advances in the core software technologyand the vision neural net, and then, very importantly, the Tesla self-driving trip technology that we'vebeen working on for 3 years is finally coming to fruition. Pete Bannon is going to talk a lot about that. Butit's a plug-in replacement for the existing computer, and enables an order of magnitude improvements inoperations per second or frames per second is the way to think about it. And we can go say, they reallyare key to Tesla full vehicle autonomy. And [indiscernible] to be really easy to replace. I'll let Pete talkabout that. So we're going to start with like, Stuart, Andrej and then Pete. [indiscernible]Stuart BowersVice President of EngineeringOkay. Hi, I'm Stuart.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYou're going to have to talk a lot louder.Stuart Bowers 6Vice President of EngineeringOh, yes, I'll just talk extra loud. So I'm Stuart. Yes, I joined team relatively recently. Incredibly excitedkind of to see the foundation the team has built up until this point and building on top of that right now.So right now, a lot of the focus is on Autopilot V9, which is our sort of on-ramp to off-ramp solution that'sgoing to automatically attempt to change lanes, understand what lane the car is in, understand the routethe user wants to travel and take that route for the user and ultimately hand back control to that user injust kind of safe and controlled.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectIntegrated navigation. So you're like, you have to get to one place, you say like -- you just -- by the way,a little tip for -- if you're driving Model S or X or 3, is if you just tap and hold -- tap the navigate buttonand just drag down, it will automatically navigate you to your home or work, depending upon where youare. That's a pretty cool feature."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "Yes.Stuart BowersVice President of EngineeringSo yes, a lot of focus right now, we're also kind of digging in on some new safety features. I think,probably the thing that's just most exciting for me coming into the team is just seeing the foundationsbeing built out over the last 2 years. I think, Andrej will talk a lot about some of the perception and visionwork we've done there, including data engine. That has sort of allowed us to build on top of that very,very quickly. And I think we're all starting to see a new set of safety features that really only makes sense.In this world, we have extremely high understanding of tapping around the vehicle. So I think, when Istart to think about what makes me excited about coming to work, it's like, one, starting to introduce realaspects of kind of not just making the kind of reducing the drudgery or kind of the risk of commuting, butalso really making the element fun. And the second is like dramatically improving safety in a way that youreally can only do once you have this like very nuanced understanding of the world around you throughperception.Andrej KarpathyDirector of Artificial Intelligence & Autopilot VisionHello, everyone. My name is Andrej Karpathy, and I'm the Director of AI here at Tesla. In particular, I leadthe vision team, which is responsible for turning the video stream that we receive from all the camerasin the vehicle into an understanding of what is around us and around the vehicle. I work with neuralnetworks for about 10 years, earned my -- mostly as PhD student at Stanford, and as a research scientistin OpenAI, And what I'm really excited about is really building up this infrastructure for computer visionthat underlies all the neural network training, trying to get those networks to work extremely well andmake that really good foundation on top of which we build out all the features of the autopilot, like thefeatures associated with the V9 where really that's going to come up and that Stuart has mentioned.Peter BannonThis is Pete Bannon. My team...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect[indiscernible] talk loudly -- yes.Peter BannonMy team is leading currently the hardware 3 development. The chips are up and working, and we havedrop-in replacements for S, X and 3. All have been driven in the field."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "They support the current networksrunning today in the car at full frame rates, with a lot of idle cycles to spare. So I think we're all reallyexcited about what Andrej and his team will be able to do with this hardware in the future. I think, likeone little anecdotal story was I gave a talk to his team on hardware 3 last month, explaining how it 7worked and what it was capable of. And then, afterwards, one of the researchers came up to me, he wasreally excited and he said, \"this is so exciting.\"So as a hardware designer, having excited software developers is the best. It's a really fun place to workbecause I do get to work with my 2 primary customers, Stuart and Andrej, and making them happy ispretty fun.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectActually, Pete, maybe -- a lot of people know about your background, but not everyone does, so if you canjust like -- Pete's a super humble guy, but if you could just, yes, talk about the stuff you've done before.Peter BannonLet's see, I started working designing computers in Digital Equipment Corporation in 1984, back whenthey were refrigerator-sized, and have been working on smaller and smaller designs ever since. I wasan Intel fellow, working on a team for a little while, then I was VP of Architecture and Verification at PASemi, which was acquired by Apple. I led the design of the first ARM 32-bit processor that went into theiPhone 5. I built the team that designed the first ARM 64-bit processor in the world, which went into theiPhone 5S. And then, I worked on performance modeling and performance improvements at Apple for 8years. And then, 2 years later, I came to Tesla, and designed the neural network accelerator that's part ofhardware 3 and helped architect the rest of the hardware 3 solution that will be in the car next year.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, maybe worth articulating some of the details, what the design principles that -- explain why, at Tesla,AI chip or AI computer essentially for the car is able to achieve order of magnitude better processing thananything else that exists.Peter BannonSure. So like 2 years ago, when I joined Tesla, we did a survey of all of the solutions that were out therefor running neural networks, including GPUs."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "We went and talked to other people like at ARM that werebuilding embedded solutions for running neural networks, and pretty much everywhere we looked, ifsomebody had a hammer, whether it was a CPU or a GPU or whatever, they were adding something toaccelerate neural networks, but nobody was doing a bottoms up design from scratch, which is what weelected to do. We had the benefit of having the insight into seeing what Tesla's neural networks looked likeback then, and having projections to what they would look like into the future and we're able to leverageall of that knowledge and are willing to totally commit to that style of computing to produce the designthat's dramatically more efficient and has dramatically more performance than what you can buy today.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, thanks. Yes, I mean, essentially, the key is to be able to run the neural net at a fundamental -- ata bare metal level so that you're -- in the circuits, especially when you're the calculations in the circuitsitself and not in some sort of emulation mode, which is how a GPU or CPU would operate. So you want todo basically a mass amount of localized matrix calculations with the memory right there. So it's a hugenumber of very simple complications with the memory needed to straight adjust those complications rightnext to the circuits that are doing the matrix calculations. And the net effect is an order of magnitudeimprovement in the frames per second. Our current hardware, which I'm a big fan of NVIDIA, they'regreat stuff, but using a GPU, primarily, it's an emulation mode. So -- and you also get choked on the bus.So the transfer between the GPU and the CPU ends up being one that constrains the system. So the neteffect is we're able to, with the Tesla computer, we've been in like semi-stealth mode basically for thelast 2 to 3 years on this, but I think it's probably time to let the cat out of the bag because that -- thecat's coming out of the bag anyway. So it's an incredible job by Pete, as seen. It's great, the world's mostadvanced computer for -- designed specifically for autonomous operation."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "And as a rough sort of figure of 8merit, whereas the current NVIDIA-based hardware can do 200 frames a second, this is able to do over2,000 frames a second, and with full redundancy and fail over. So it's an amazing design and we're lookingto increase the size of our chip team and our investment in that as quickly as possible.I think we're at some of the best days the world, but I think we want to build on it even more. And it'sgoing to cost the same as our current hardware, and we anticipate that this -- they would actually justreplace those replacements, which is why we made it easy to switch out the computer. And that's allthat needs to be done. If we take out one computer and plug in the next, that's it. All the connectors arecompatible, and an order of magnitude more processing. And you can run all cameras at full frame rate,full resolution with a complex neural net. So it's super kickass. Thank you for doing that.Peter BannonYou're welcome.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectThanks for making net and thanks for making the software. And I'd like -- basically, I wanted to introduce3 of the key people at Tesla that are doing this. I have huge respect and admiration for you guys. And it'sbecause of what you and your team is doing that's how we're successful in this arena.Martin ViechaThank you, Elon. Sherry. Let's go to the first question. 9Question and Answer"
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "Our first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionI have one question and one follow-up, please. First, just on gross margins, it looks like S and X grossmargins were up maybe 500 basis points sequentially. And I'm wondering, maybe you can articulatewhat drove that? And then, more importantly, it looks like you're calling for Model 3 gross margins togo from about maybe 3% this quarter to 15% next quarter. That's about a $6,000 cost out per car.And I'm wondering if you can maybe help us understand what sort of the forces that drive that kind ofimprovement in a relatively short time frame?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, absolutely. First of all, I'd like to apologize for being impolite on the prior call. Honestly, I don't thinkthere is really any excuse for bad manners, I was kind of violating my own rule in that regard. So I havesome excuse -- there are reasons for it, I've gotten no sleep and have been working sort of 110-hour,120-hour weeks. But nonetheless, still no excuse. My apologies for not being polite on the prior call.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionI appreciate that. Thank you.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectAnd let's see, with respect to gross margin, I'll touch on that and then hand the rest to Deepak. Butcertainly, when spooling up the production line, there are tremendous amount of inefficiencies. There'sa lot of hurry up and wait where some parts of the production line move well and one part doesn't. Andwe have associates waiting around with nothing to do. There are parts that we thought were right butthen it turns out we've got -- they weren't right and then we send it back to the supplier. It's just like thewhole sort of giant machine kind of -- you just need to have to lurch into a high pace. And there's a lot oflurching, which is very inefficient. So you end up having super high labor cost per car. And it just needs --it takes time to sort of spool up this giant machine. It's a -- basically, a production system is like a giantcybernetic collector. And then, it moves as fast as its slowest part."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "So as we address those slow parts andas you improve efficiency, then gap -- grow gross margin, and so the profitability of the car just improvesdramatically. That's sort of at a high level. Do you want to add to that?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerNo, you described it extremely well. So just to sort of summarize, this was a major milestone for us in Q2that the gross margin in Model 3 turned slightly positive. And we feel really good about the path ahead.And as Elon said, it's driven predominantly by manufacturing cost efficiencies. It's the labor hours that weuse to produce each car becomes less, the initial ramp up costs that we have that are one-time as thoseinefficiencies disappear. Our fixed cost that are there, that gets leveraged to a higher volume. So all ofthat.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectActually, a thing that can also happen is that if it turns out that, say, a production part was either designedwrong or built wrong or something wrong with it, then on a kind of emergency basis, we have to go with 10low-volume tooling, which can be produced quickly. But a power producer of a low-volume tooling caneasily be 10x more than a product produced off of production tooling. And so just wanted -- you can have-- and sometimes, it's -- it gets really nutty [indiscernible]. If you got a machine and something happenedout of a block, and it's either that or make a car, but the cost of using low volume, cost of producing low-volume tooling can be really nutty.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd that journey just continues. As we stabilize and grow production from these levels, we achieve evenmore efficiencies. And Q3 also benefits with somewhat improved mix as we're going to sell more all-wheeldrive and performance cars. And in the long run, as we continue to achieve those efficiencies on cost, ourgross margins will continue to increase.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. I mean, I don't know if this trend will continue. We're trying to give you essentially all the informationthat at least we know, but we're seeing roughly half of our customers choose the dual-motor all-wheeldrive option, which is actually quite a good positive surprise.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, it's been heartening to see that mix in terms of what customers want. And Robin can probably addmore to that.Robin RenYes."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "So starting from end of June, when we opened the configurator and invited the existing reservationorders, we saw tremendous excitement and response from our customers. As Deepak just mentioned, weactually see more orders for the all-wheel drive dual-motor car and performance cars combined than therear-wheel drive cars.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. It's -- we don't want to say this should be assumed to be a continued thing. It's just the thing we areseeing now.Robin RenCorrect. And another thing I want to point out is that we are absolutely -- since we opened theconfigurator to the general public in early July, we are seeing an increased demand coming from peoplewho do not currently hold a reservation. I think that's something that we found super exciting becausethese are the people who actually had no idea about Model 3 and they heard about Model 3 as available toorder. Many of them requested test drives. And since early July, we have over 60,000 test drive requestsin the U.S. alone. And these people come into our stores, do the test drive, and they become superexcited and they decide to order a car. So we believe that the strong demand coming from, especially thenon-reservation orders, is going to dramatically increase as we increase our test drive population. To giveyou an example, 3 weeks ago, we had only 8 stores having test drive cars, to Elon's point earlier. Now wehave over 90 stores having test drive cars.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectIt's worth mentioning, just an interesting little bits of information that Robin was telling me -- and Robin, Iwould just congratulate you on doing a great job running worldwide sales [indiscernible] and the also workdone in China, which is like really some next-level stuff. Robin was born and raised in China, and has been-- along with Tom and Grace as well, the team China has been instrumental in establishing the Tesla China 11factory and making sure that gets done right and have a great relationship with the government. So nicework in that regard. But it's really -- I think -- and some of the things people won't expect, like what arethe top 5 trade-in cars for Model 3?Robin RenYes, this is very interesting. So we looked at what people who are buying Model 3 cars in the UnitedStates, what cars they are trading in."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "What we found is throughout this year, from January to July, the top5 non-Tesla cars people are trading in to get into a Model 3, they are Toyota Prius, BMW 3 Series, HondaAccord, Honda Civic and Nissan Leaf.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectReally surprising.Robin RenYes, they are surprising because they are not the traditional premium sedans. They are actually -- many ofthem are mainstream midsized sedans.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectRight. And obviously, at this point, not yet selling at $35,000 a car. So it is promising for the future."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.Joseph Robert SpakRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research DivisionMaybe we could tackle some of the commentary about the Gigafactory coming in, in China. When you firstannounced the Gigafactory 1, I think you said that was going to be about a $5 billion investment. And youmentioned some volume numbers associated with what you think you can do in China. So we do someextrapolation, looks like maybe 15 gigawatts of -- gigawatt hours of initial capacity. I'm wondering if youcould also do a linear extrapolation on the cost you think you need for that factory.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectSure. And I would also like to apologize for being impolite on the last call with you. That was not right. Ihope you accept my apologies.Joseph Robert SpakRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research DivisionThanks.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectSo with respect to Gigafactory, with CapEx, I think, we booked a tremendous amount with Gigafactory 1.And we're confident that we can do the Gigafactory in China for a lot less. I think it's probably closer to-- this is just a guess, but probably closer to $2 billion. And unless we be at a higher -- and that wouldbe sort of the 250,000 vehicle per year rate. And so I think we could be a lot more efficient with CapEx.And that would include at least battery module and pack production, body shop, paint shop and generalassembly. [indiscernible] but that's about the right number for that. And sub production is something westill need to figure out with respect to the Shanghai factory. So J.B. would you like to add to that?Jeffrey B. Straubel 12Chief Technology OfficerYes, I agree with all that. We found surprising number of ways to improve efficiency and speed anddensity as well at Gigafactory 1. And all those lessons will absolutely be shared with Gigafactory 3.The teams are already, of course, beginning to collaborate and start to figure out ways to do this moreefficiently and with less CapEx than last time. Yes.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, I think we -- like less than half is like would be a good estimate. And maybe a lot less than half, butnot more than half would be a fair estimate for CapEx to get to that 250,000 level."

StraubelChief Technology OfficerI mean, there are so many specific examples. But even in just recent weeks and months, we found somecertain areas of production that have been very capital-intensive that we've been able to speed up withalmost no additional CapEx by maybe 20%, even 25% or 30% just by...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, including the cell production.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, just by challenging some of the initial assumptions, the specifications, tweaking the control andsoftware.Elon R.

And some of it actuallyends up not being -- not matter at all.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerAnd that's with basically 0 CapEx. So as you start to add very tactical strategic CapEx to the existing lines,that's how we can get to something close to double or beyond with a really, really small increment.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. One of the key to the success on the Model 3 production was the [indiscernible] which is led byJerome. Jerome also was key in doing the Zone 1, 2 order lines, which was critical because [indiscernible]we had a fundamental failure and especially in Zone 1 -- Zone 2 of [indiscernible] module production[indiscernible] that was [indiscernible] is amazing. I feel like [indiscernible] our tent. But by the way,our tent is amazing. And this is not like [indiscernible] like some sort of you buy at REI or something likethat, you go camping. This is a tent that is actually commonly used as a permanent structure. It's a giantthing that is very commonly used as a permanent structure. And the -- and we just had to come up witha creative solution because GA 3 was not going to be able to make the rate. And so we have to come upwith some ideas and perhaps provide [indiscernible] a little transparent. It's interesting, if you want to...Deepak AhujaChief Financial Officer 13Yes.

So this may be a model of how we may want to start general assembly for future vehicles, at leaststart. And we can always add further automation and complexity.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectAnd so what is counterintuitive is that this actually has fully considered fewer labor hours per car thanlike the GA 3 system. And just to elaborate on what I was saying, when we have parts delivery to GA 4,the truck literally like they just backs up to the side of the line. It was like a door in the tent. And thenthat's used to unload parts from suppliers directly to where they're needed on the line. So there's nointermediate [indiscernible] whereas for GA 3, they unload it, they put it in a warehouse, then they'rerepackaged for the warehouse into these turrets which just actually -- so we actually have 220 people,something like that across all shifts, whose only job it was, was to repackage parts from the boxes fromsuppliers to the boxes that -- to these turrets that go into lifters that go up into GA 3. And especially allthey do is move things from one box to another box, and we don't need that at all on GA 4.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAll gone.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectAll gone, yes. And the stress of sort of 24/7 robotics, technicians that are constantly trying to make themachines have uptime, that's very expensive. And so when we think about not having to maintain allthese robotic systems, that's a big cost savings as well. And now we're going to gradually be addingsimple automation into GA 4 to make it easier to build a car and that are sort of labor saving devices. It'sfundamental. It's already at an efficiency level greater than GA 3, which is pretty impressive."

First is, there's so much love and respect for colleagues and Wall Street analysts on thiscall. It's almost -- it is lifting my spirits. What can I say? I got 2 questions. The first is for the Autopilotteam. There's an argument that a fully autonomous car is essentially like a terminator that is programmedto save lives in highly complex terrestrial environments. And that this same technology, with a few tweaks,have some pretty obvious military capability. Do you see any risk that U.S. companies will ultimately notbe allowed to operate weapons grade AI-based technology in a market like China and vice versa?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, this has never come up. I wouldn't call it weapons grade. It's just like the car's trying to drive. Andif anything, the autonomous cars will be pretty easy to bully because they'll be optimizing so much foravoiding collision. So that'll be more of a challenge than anything else, is as soon as somebody sees thosecars are autonomous, they know they can like cut them off and the car's going to be doing what it can toavoid a collision. So it's like that'll actually be probably a bigger challenge than anything else. But we'venot encountered anything of the nature of what you're saying.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionSo you don't see autonomous cars as a potential germination or training grounds for things that wouldhave a national security or military interest. Okay. Maybe a follow-up, Elon, and my last question. Who doyou think would be a more formidable competitor over time, BMW or Amazon? 16Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectFor Tesla?Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionFor Tesla.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectNo, I don't think either of them are likely to be -- as far as I know, I mean, I'd be pretty shocked ifAmazon got into the car business, but I think BMW has great engineering. They're -- and it's good to seethat they're making some investments in electrification. Hopefully, they do more of that. And I'm not surewhere they stand on autonomy.

FerraguNew Street Research LLP_So I wanted to make sure we understand well how you stop burning cash going forward in comingquarters. And my understanding is that an important moving part here probably is -- probably the mostimportant one, is a positive impact of the ramp of the Model 3 on your working capital. And so I did somequick math on the quarter and I see your payables increased by $430 million while your receivable didn'tmove much, which makes sense because you get paid on the spot and you pay your suppliers only on a60-day notice or more. And so if I divide that by the number of incremental cars you've been producingin the quarter, I get to about $23,000 per car. And of course, my question is whether this is a good wayto think about it, which means that going forward, when you move into Q3 and Q4, every additional car,every additional Model 3 you're going to produce, you're going to bump up payables by something in theregion of $20,000, and that's going to be the main driver getting you to breakeven and to stop burningcash.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, Deepak here. I mean, there are many factors. Clearly, the working capital benefit of the differencein the payable terms versus collecting cash is one of them. But also, it's our gross margin improvementon the business, it's the higher volumes and the higher gross margin resulting in higher gross profit. I'mstating the obvious there on Model 3. Our S and X volumes are increasing, too, in the second half. That'sgoing to help us significantly. And all of our other businesses are improving their profitability while ourOpEx is staying essentially flat, so massive leverage in the business. So when you combine all of that,that's what is giving us the cash flow from operations to fund our -- the rest of our business and growcash. I'm stating the obvious, but just I'm summarizing the whole point, yes.Pierre C. FerraguNew Street Research LLPAnd in terms of other [indiscernible]? Sorry, go ahead.Elon R.

We've been looking forward to this fully autonomous coast-to-coast drive. And, Elon, I think you sort of said on previous calls, if I can paraphrase, that the team'sbeen focused on developing a full self-driving suite that would work basically on all different kinds of roadconditions. And I'm just curious, what's holding back that capability today to go coast-to-coast? And arewe closer now that you've strengthened the compute technology?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, the -- we can do a coast-to-coast drive especially if we pick a specific route and then write code toreally make that route work. We could do a coast-to-coast route drive, but that would be kind of gamingthe system, and I think it's really important for the Autopilot team to be focused on fundamental safety ofthe existing features. So that's -- the focus is really massively on safety of existing features. And there'sa dev -- an advanced dev role that can do things like recognize traffic lights and stop signs and makehard right turns and that kind of thing. But it's not the safety level that [makes it okay for release ]. Sobut -- yes, because it really -- you want many lines of reliability before anything that's released to endcustomers. So I don't want to take team off that until so we feel like we've really -- done everything wecan for the core functionality. And, Stuart, do you want to add to that?Stuart BowersVice President of EngineeringYes. I mean, I think, the big thing I'd say is that, Elon, to reiterate Elon's point, there's no question youcan kind of build a demo around the stuff. The challenge right now for the team is just increasing thesafety and utility of Autopilot to over a quarter million cars we have today and pushing more out afterthat. So I think, when we look kind of forward to what the next probably 6 to 12 months look like, it'staking those same kind of features that we've been working on, probably deploying them in the formof active safety features. Like that's like a thing we can do already, is to understand like use this richunderstanding in environment to actually try to keep you safer, to either beep or brake."

So we're solving for that very rapidly,and we expect to ramp up Powerwall and Powerpack production substantially later this year and earlynext. And as well as getting [indiscernible] -- as well as ramping up of the solar and then the Solar Roof.We now have several hundred homes with Solar Roof on them, and that's going well. It takes a while tojust confirm that Solar Roof is going to last for 30 years and all the details work out and working with firstresponders to make sure it's safe in the event of a fire and that kind of thing. So it's quite a long validationprogram for a roof which has got to last for 30, 40, 50 years. But that we also expect to ramp that upnext year at Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo. That's going to be super exciting. So [indiscernible] I think we're[indiscernible] if there's a company with a better product roadmap. I'd like to know what it is because likethis is what -- we got some super awesome stuff coming. Yes.Zachary ShahanAnd regarding the Model Y, there's been a lot of questioning if you're going to have the same process aswith Model 3 with reservations, if you can shorten the reservation timeline or if you're going to have adifferent process this time around.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWe haven't made a final decision on that.Zachary ShahanSo last question, then. Regarding the daily production, we've been seeing a sort of a rise and fall with thedaily production of the Model 3 as you incorporate new performance or white seats. Can you speak at all-- we always like to get the technical side of what you're doing there. Can you tell what the bottlenecksare right now that you're working through? And what we can sort of -- how we can picture ourselves in thefactory there with you?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectAll right."

And -- but after what -- be carefulI don't have soundbite that is then for those that don't have a nuanced appreciation of the situation, thatsoundbite then gets -- becomes front-page news. That's like, nope, that's not what I meant. Exactly. Andlike, oh, man. this is like [indiscernible] But the -- right now, the biggest constraint on production again,do not -- please don't make federal case out of this because it's something that will be solved in like ina matter of like a week or 2. It's like it's body production, so that's why -- I mean, you can certainly tellwhat am I personally working on that's going to be a bottleneck in the company. So most likely producingModel 3 bodies. We made huge progress in the last few weeks and, in fact, I was just told that we're ableto achieve our first 24-hour period where we made over 800 Model 3 bodies, which is pretty great. And sothat sets us -- so we just make sure again that we sustain that 800-plus per day rate. And then paint isdoing great. GA's doing great. Yes, it's good.Zachary ShahanA quick request. Years ago, you warned about a coming short tsunami and it seemed obvious that it wascoming, but the shorts didn't really seem to recognize it and then sort of attacked you, trolled you formonths. And then finally, it came. You again warned very honestly, I think, very directly that there is goingto be a short -- kind of epic short squeeze. We have, I think, the whole community has a little request.Don't let the trolls get you down. Don't feed the trolls too much, but we do like it when you tease the trollsa bit. So use your judgment, but thanks a lot for what you're doing.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectRight. Well, thank you for your in depth coverage of clean air energy technology. 27Martin ViechaAnd the very last question comes from Galileo Russell who represents the retail shareholders.Galileo RussellCongrats on awesome quarter. Really proud to be a Tesla shareholder with the Model 3 ramping to 5,000a week."

And then I'm curious on any manufacturing synergies between the Semiand the Model 3.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectOh interesting questions. You always ask us really, really interesting questions. Really, really interestingquestions that I cannot actually -- the first one, I cannot -- it gets so much attention where we putproduction, so I cannot answer any like where we're going to put production questions. The -- but will theSemi use a bunch of Model 3 technology, the answer is yes. Jerome, I don't know if you want to elaborateon that or...Jerome GuillenVice President of ProgramsWell, I mean, you can already see in the prototype that we've had virtually out of the Model 3 component,the screen, the door handles, I mean, as much as possible -- yes, the motors, yes, and the prototype a lotof the cell technology. But there are some changes and I'd rather not say it in public, yes. Obviously, it'sgoing to be better than what we showed last year, a lot of improvements. Yes.Galileo RussellOkay. So hopefully, you can talk more about this. With the battery project with PG&E that was recentlyannounced, I'm wondering if you can elaborate how you're prioritizing battery pack between auto andenergy storage. Because it seems like you ramped auto battery packs to 20 gigawatt hours in the past12 months, but are only guiding for about 1 gigawatt hour of Tesla energy installation in the next year.So I'm wondering why is Tesla Energy, given its supply constraints, like why not ramp that supply to 10gigawatts? It seems like the guidance is still below there.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. It's -- as Elon suggested earlier, we are -- essentially, it makes sense for us to prioritize Model 3.But we are adding a ton of capacity, self-capacity, and J.B. could talk more about it, that will enable us todramatically ramp our energy storage business as well in the coming quarters.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. You kind of mentioned only 1 gigawatt hour, but that's a big number in that business, and it's maybeon the order of 300% what we did the prior year. And we're still aiming at maybe another 3, 3x to 4xgrowth for 2019.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectSo we're at scale. These are insane growth levels.Jeffrey B."

This is like you actually need to build those -- like a lot of atoms but[indiscernible] you know what I mean? Like once you build software, you can obviously have lots ofcopies, but there's like a lot of really complicated atoms, man.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerMaybe specifically also to your cell -- to the cell limitation question, I think this has been mentionedbefore, but we also do use some other vendors.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWe use Panasonic and LG and...Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerExactly, our energy products. So I heard people feel like this is kind of a zero-sum game or somethingwith Model 3, but that is not the case.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWe do a partial-sum game [indiscernible] we did shut down this Powerwall cell line for Model 3, to betotally honest, but we kind of have to do that. But that's -- we're adding new cell lines, and we'll be ableto address that issue very soon.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerI think one perspective we are seeing tripling [indiscernible] also...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectSo these are mad growth numbers, mad.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerLast year, and it's one thing to produce, but it's also another thing to install [indiscernible] you need theinfrastructure and the people to do that. So this massive scaling is very few companies grow at that rate.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. And one of the great challenges [indiscernible] there need to be a lot more electricians. So weactually had an electrician training program. We're going to actually have to fast-train new people who'venever been electricians before to be electricians because otherwise, [indiscernible] there's not enoughelectrician capacity in the United States and most places in the world to install Powerwalls. And so we'dhave to actually literally train electricians and like it takes like 2 years basically before somebody iscertified to be an electrician. So it sounds like, okay, we [ obviously ] can't grow faster than the rates andnumber of electricians who can physically install Powerwalls. That's like one of the limitations.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerAnd that PG&E project you mentioned is an incredibly exciting one. It kind of is indicative of the growthrate. It has [indiscernible] 29Galileo RussellYes, can you elaborate on that?Elon R."

And it has a -- and just to give you a sense, it took us 5 years of growing that business to get toa gigawatt hour cumulative deployed.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectAnd so many people who had said gigawatt hour is an impossible number for lithium-ion. Like that's --yes.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerThe car business is still much bigger as we sit here today, but the growth rate on energy is faster.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, if you extrapolate energy growth rate -- well, obviously if you extrapolate anything; triple for a year,pretty soon becomes size of your universe. But long term, we would expect the energy business to catchup to the order of business in size.Galileo RussellAnd then lastly, I'm really curious. Elon, do you have any part of the business that shareholders should beasking or thinking more about? Or what do you wish would have been asked on the call?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectGood question. We're trying to anticipate -- actually we're trying to anticipate the questions that are onpeople's minds, that's why I have the Autopilot, key leaders of the Autopilot team here and much of theexecutive team of Tesla here, to try to be proactive in that regard. Was there anything [indiscernible] Ithink we really covered a lot. So there is any -- yes.Galileo RussellJust my very last thing, the new fiscal engineering strategy of profit and cash flow and you saying thatwill last in perpetuity sort of, sort of caught me by surprise personally. And so I'm curious if there's anytradeoff to growth with that new strategy? Or sort of what's the rationale behind the scenes. Because thisjust seems like the biggest change in Tesla's financial engineering strategy since the IPO. 30Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, I mean, being cash flow positive and capital positive doesn't mean we're rolling in money. Like there'sdefinitely going to be cases where we're just barely cash flow positive or barely profitable in some quartersin the future. But I think we're -- and it's been a long time now, it's almost 15 years now."

And I think we can -- I think this is probably theright thing to do, is to be sort of essentially self-funding on a go-forward basis. And apart from selectivesituations where there's some debt, temporary debt for construction of a Gigafactory in China or Europeor something like that, but apart from that, I think we -- like essentially, I don't think we're constraininggrowth in any significant way by adopting the strategy at this point. It would have been true in times past,but I think it is not the case. Yes.Martin ViechaOkay. I think that's all [indiscernible]. Thank you very much.
