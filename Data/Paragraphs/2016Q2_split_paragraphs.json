As a reminder, this conference may berecorded.I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jeff Evanson. Sir, you may begin.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsThank you, Latif, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's second quarter 2016 Q&A webcast.I'm joined today by Elon Musk; J.B. Straubel; Jason Wheeler; and Jon McNeill.Our Q2 results are in the updated -- or in the update letter at the same link as this webcast. And today,during our call, we'll discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These are basedon our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to anumber of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent SEC filings.We're going to kick it off today with Jason making some quick comments followed by Q&A."

        "paragraph": "So Jason, over to you.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everybody for joining. I just want to make a few brief comments to add alittle bit more color to the shareholder later.We're clearly disappointed with our delivery numbers but there's some underlying stories that we feelreally good about, and I want to walk you through those. Automotive gross margin expanded this quarter.Automotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits grew from 20.1% in Q1 to 21.2% in Q2. A couple ofdifferent factors here. One was the Model S refresh. There was a modest price increase on the refresh butmore importantly, we had baked the number of cost-downs into that vehicle before the launch. And thenthe second big factor is obviously X production. We've talked a lot about how we have come through thestruggles on that and how we've managed to climb that production ramp, so that's looking great.On a go-forward basis, the way we're thinking about margins is we certainly see opportunities forcontinued cost-downs, both on the engineering front, also on the commercial front as well. We've gota supplier base that is very excited about the Model 3, and it's giving us the ability to leverage that,included for cost-downs and also continue manufacturing efficiencies. As we mentioned in the shareholderletter, labor hours per car is trending quite positively right now and we're laser focused on continuedimprovement in that key metric.Next, talk about the cash position for a second. Here's one way to think about it. We ended up with $3.25billion on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. We started off the year, in December 31, 2015,we had $1.2 billion. We raised $1.7 billion in our secondary offering and we collected on our Model 3reservations. Therefore, we are in a very healthy position from a cash perspective.A couple of different factors here to talk about. One, we've got $678 million drawn on our asset-backedline. This is something that we've talked about in the past. That is definitely backed up by our operations.Two things there. One, approximately 5,000 cars in transit to customers at quarter end. We're financingour FGI. And we're monetizing our direct lease portfolio.Second factor on the cash position that we'd like to highlight is our continued CapEx discipline. As wetalked about in Q1, we had $217 million of CapEx in that quarter. In this quarter, $295 million of CapEx.We compare that to averaging nearly $400 million a quarter throughout 2015."

        "paragraph": "We're actually very pleasedwith these results and we're comfortable that we aren't doing anything to adversely impact our future. Ona go-forward basis, thinking about CapEx efficiency, you've heard Elon talk a lot about that machine thatmakes the machine. A big part of that is focusing on volumetric efficiency. In our call on Monday, I talkedabout how when we started to review a lot of the Model 3 CapEx plans across the company, there were abunch of new buildings everywhere. And the reaction to that was: wait a second, we've actually got a nicefacilities footprint already, and how can we just amplify those facilities and not have to invest further inthis area? And we're starting to see a lot of that take hold now.Second, I think we're making an attempt to crush the conventional wisdom that capacity increases onlyhappen in step-change increments and the capital that follows that in step-change increments as well. Andto put a little bit more color on that, there are many ways to optimize our current operations. The way tothink about this is we can just drive greater throughput through the same investments. So that's our cashposition.Finally, I'd just like to talk for a minute about expense management. In addition to our efforts on CapExefficiency, we're also very focused on OpEx discipline. This quarter, SG&A would have been flat quarter-over-quarter in spite of our continued expansion in service and sales, were it not for the payroll taxes wepaid on our CEO's options exercises. SG&A was up $19 million quarter-over-quarter on a non-GAAP basis.$17 million of that was the payroll expense associated with those option exercises.R&D now does continue to increase as we continue to march towards the Model 3 launch and continue toinvest in our future. This is as predicted and as we've signaled in the past.So to wrap it all up, we're very happy with the gross margin expansion in the quarter and we haveincreased our emphasis on OpEx discipline and CapEx efficiency. We believe our Q2 results reflect that andwe're not backing down as we move forward.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsGreat. Thank you, Jason. All right, Latif, let's go to the first question, please."

        "paragraph": "Our first question comes from Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley.Neel MehtaMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionI'm going to ask this question on behalf of Adam Jonas. He had to drop off the call. This is Neel Mehta.This is coming directly from him. You have explained -- Elon, you've explained the strategic rationale forhaving SolarCity and Tesla Motors join in a combined company. When we think of SpaceX, is there anyconceivable strategic rationale for Tesla Motors and Tesla Energy or Tesla Solar to work closely with theefforts of space exploration? And when we're thinking about this, we're thinking proprietary lower at theorbit satellite network to enhance the connected autonomous car ecosystem. And so yes, I just want toget your thoughts on that, first of all, and I have a follow-up as well.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I don't think there's a strong park rationale to combine SpaceX and Tesla, whereas there is for Teslaand SolarCity. It's really quite tenuous for SpaceX and Tesla. So there's a little cooperation that happensbetween the companies but it's not enough that would justify merging them into 1 entity.Neel MehtaMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionGot it. And can you also give us update us on your -- on Tesla's proprietary mapping initiatives?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderNo, I think we would -- we should -- we prefer it be confidential in that regard. What we've said thus faris just that we're -- there's a need to have much higher-definition maps than currently existing around theworld in order to have full autonomy. And we're in the process of building those and I think making goodprogress."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionA couple of questions very much tied to cash flow and the borrowing capacity. First is just aroundcustomer deposits which were a source of cash in the quarter but looked to be about $288 million. As ofMay, you had 373-ish (sic) [373,000-ish] Model S -- Model 3 preorders which would imply about a $375million inflow [indiscernible]. Could you maybe walk us between that number and what the actual changein deposits were? And in particular, where did Model 3 preorders end the quarter at?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. So in terms of thinking about the cash flow, yes, you're doing your math correctly, but we alsorelease deposits when we deliver cars, so there's an inflow and there is an outflow there. And we had --the deposits on the early Model X cars were larger than the later Model X cars as well, so that's one of theimpacts there as well. In terms of the Model 3 reservations, the 373,000 number that you reference iswhat we talked about when we did our secondary offering, and we're sticking to that number in terms ofdisclosure.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. Second question around the shift from increased on-balance sheet captive lending. My quickcalculations, if you go up 8% in the back half off of your 50k guide, that seems to be, at 100k, about a$350 million cash need. And merely you're paying [ph] -- actually would be less with the cost of goodssold, call, $250 million, $280 million. Are you going to finance that out of your ABL? How quickly can youget another lease partner? And what do the amendments to the credit agreement for SolarCity kind of doto your ability to borrow against that for this captive financing?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. So in terms of -- the ABL is definitely available for some of that for sure. And then the overallliquidity position gives us confidence that we'll be able to do this. At the same time, we do have a lot --many active discussions going on with other lease partners and we're looking at other ways to do this aswell. And I don't want to talk a lot about SolarCity on this call. That's not what it is, but they've got somepretty advanced capability in thinking through how to walk through this as well."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson of Dougherty & Company.Charles Lowell AndersonDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionMy first question is around the sharing of vehicles described in the updated master plan. So if we'removing from 5% to 10% utilization of the vehicle to some larger number, I wonder what you think theramifications of that might be on the number of cars that need to be produced every year. And thenmaybe, the ramifications as it relates to the supercharger of the cars or the supercharger network, if thecars are always driving around? And then I have a follow-up.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, I think that the demand for autonomous cars will pass that way to the production capability. So Imean just want to bear in mind that the global fleets of vehicles is about 2.5 billion roughly and total newvehicle production ever year is only about 100 million. So the fleet's base would be turning over everyroughly 20, 25 years. So if we -- we would have to make some truly enormous number of autonomousvehicles for there to be any demand saturation because it'll basically be the only car anyone wants to buy.Charles Lowell AndersonDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionAnd then for my second question, I wonder if you could clarify comments made on the last call aboutinverter technology. You mentioned having some of the best in the world for power electronics. So Iwonder if you could just comment if that's the case that you will be making your own inverter. And if so,what will be the benefit to the overall system with your inverter technology versus what's used today?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I think there's no question Tesla's going to do integrated inverter. Logically too, I think we've gotthe most advanced inverter engineering team in the world. And so it makes sense to just as we do theinverters on vehicles to do it with solar as well and have it in a very tight package at a cents per watt levelthat is, I think, probably twice as good as anyone else, I think maybe better than that. So that's like theobvious move there. And as part of what I was referring to is kind of an integrated product. I mean, ifyou're -- if you put yourself in the consumer's shoes, you just want it to work. You don't want to know howit works, what you -- you don't care about the details."

There's only 1 phone app. You want it to be easy. You want it to just work and you want it tobe affordable and you want it to look good. So that's what we're going to do.Jason S.

If you ask them what's DC current or what's directcurrent, what's alternating current, they would not be able tell you. A lot of people don't even know thedifference between power and energy, like one's in kilowatts, another one's in kilowatt hours, so -- andthey don't need to know. Like there's not a good reason for them to know. Stuff should just work and takecare of itself."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionCan you just give an update of the Model S demand? In the press release, you indicated S and X orderswere up about 65% year-over-year, but if we look at deliveries and production of the S, it hasn't changedthat much since Q4 and you're rolling out the lower-priced 60 version. So if demand is up so much, whyoffer a lower-priced model and why hasn't production really been up that much more?Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceSure. It's Jon, I'll give you a little bit of color on the demand which has been healthy for Model S in thesecond quarter and into the third quarter as well. As we mentioned in the shareholder letter, we didn'thave cars in the European market with the new refresh until the last month of the quarter. But despitethat, we had year-over-year growth in Model S demand and we also -- we had some very healthy growthin the markets where we had cars in stores. So we had double-digit growth in both North America andChina, really healthy growth in both of those markets. That growth has continued into the third quarter.But one of the things that -- one of the reasons we introduced the 60 was we saw more Model 3 demandthan we anticipated, we talked about that last quarter. And a number of those reservation holders saidto us we'd love to be in a Tesla today if you could provide a more affordable version of the Model S. Ourbattery technology allows us to do that. And so we introduced the 60, and that's generated demand outof a new market segment. It is reaching down into that Model 3 reservation holder territory and portendsreally good things for future Model 3 demand, but it's opened up a very nice segment for us for Model S.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. So whereas that -- like the -- people are not buying the base model, they're like -- they buy the60 and then they option it up quite a bit, so it ends up having like an average sale price and like over$80,000. And then since actually all the 60s actually have the 75 capacity, it's just software limited,there's potential for them to upgrade over time and certainly, for the resell value of the car to be enhancedwhen it's returned to Tesla by unlocking the additional 15 kilowatt hours of that battery capability."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "But, Imean, I think in sort of a nutshell, the way to think about Tesla right now is that we're right around 2,000cars a week, and we try to balance the mix to be about roughly half X and S. There are some variationsdepending upon regionality. Some parts of the world prefer more SUVs; some prefer more sedans. And wedo tend to batch up our cars, so this is why occasionally you see nonsensical articles about Tesla's demandsuddenly rising in some country or suddenly falling. It's got nothing to do with that; it's just happened tobe when the ship arrived. But high-level overview is just we see demand being fairly strong at an averageof 2,000 cars a week, and we are able to maintain production at that level, notwithstanding occasionalsupplier hiccups. And then hopefully, we can grow that a little bit towards the end of the quarter and thena little more in Q4. And our aspiration, this unvarnished here [ph], this is just what we're aiming to dointernally, is to do a little better than 2,000 a week in sales and deliveries in Q4, combined S and X. I feelfairly optimistic about achieving that goal. Yes, I think our core business is actually doing quite well rightnow.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionJust as a follow-up, any update on stationary storage? I think your original target for 400 million to 500million for this year and 2 million to 5 million for next year. Any just color on how that's trending.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderHeavily enduring production constraints. There were -- we've got some next-generation technologyand we've got to school [ph] up that production line. So it's going to be heavily concentrated in Q4 andprobably even heavily in November and December, but it's -- I think it's going to be really exciting whenpeople see it. So that's why I expect kind of exponential growth from there. I think it's really going to goballistic.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, and we have been making quite a few background investments in the markets where we're growing,setting up the teams and setting up to get ready for expanded product installation and distribution,especially in places like Australia and in Germany. So some of that takes a bit of time but it's laying theinfrastructure for faster growth."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer.Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionAs you look forward and without the residual value guarantee, can you talk about what's going to happenwith the warranty expense on the vehicles?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. So I think the way to think about warranty, and we put this in the shareholder letter, ongoingreserves is roughly consistent with what it's been, with what it was last quarter. And the RVG reallydoesn't have an impact on warranty expense. Really, warranty expense is all about reliability and reliabilityis something that we are constantly monitoring. And as we see positive things happen or things that go inthe other direction with reliability, that's how we then think about the ongoing reserves for warranty. So Idon't think the...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I mean I could -- I feel like, I mean, the quality, I think, has improved quite dramatically, particularlywith respect to X. We had a lot of challenges in the production ramp. That's always the most difficult timewhen you're going from 0 to 1,000 cars a week. The -- it's just you got to pull at this huge baggage trainof suppliers along with you and you've got to solve a lot of issues internally. So that production ramp is alot of hurt. But now, we're pretty stable at the 2,000 cars a week level and the -- every time we've rolledthe car at this point, it's getting better. So with each passing week, it's better and better. And so I actuallyfeel -- I feel pretty good about warranty reserves actually declining over time as a result of that.Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionOkay, great. And then my follow up is around Mobileye and the ending of that partnership and how youguys are going to approach that functionality going forward with the driver assist and the autonomousdriving push going forward?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI think we'll have a more significant announcement on that later. So it's not really -- the earnings call isnot the right time for that, except that it will be a Tesla solution, internal solution."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionThanks for taking my question which, I guess, is really for Elon. As Tesla grows very quickly and becomesincreasingly diversified, going from just the Model S to recently include the X and now, the 3 soonand you've added Tesla Energy to the mix now, SolarCity. So I'm really curious how you think aboutmanagement focus and attention and what you and your team are going to be doing to ensure strongexecution and focus as you head into the very important and, by your own admission, very challenginglaunch of the Model 3?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, I mean, the Model 3 is overwhelmingly our focus. Things are -- things feel really quite stable withS and X. We're kind of in the mode of continuous improvement, but no fundamental issues, so it's -- Ifeel like the machine that's making X and S is actually functioning quite well right now and we're just -- Idefinitely burnt out a few neurons and a lot of other people solving the production ramp earlier this year.I feel we're in a good place at this point. So the focus really is on Model 3, followed by full autonomy asprobably the top 2 priorities.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOkay. And then the follow-up is as you're starting here in 3Q to ramp up the spending on both theGigafactory and the Model 3 development capacity, et cetera, are you seeing that one or the other, theModel 3 or the retrofit of Fremont, is providing more or less potential bottlenecks than the other in termsof getting to that July 1 Model 3 launch?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI don't actually know of any -- there's not any one standout issue for July 1. Now, I do want to -- I did saythis on the last earnings call, and I think it's probably better just reiterating because it's -- I mean, I thinkit makes sense to think about it, but it does require a bit of thinking about it. I don't expect us to be at fullproduction on July 1, but I have to drive all suppliers and internal efforts to that date, knowing that somewill fall short. And if some fall -- and those that fall short, the suppliers that still fall short will be cut outof the picture."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "And if there are teams internally that failed to execute effectively, we will reorganize thoseteams. But if several thousand parts are not driven to a particular date, there is no chance of making anypoint even past that date. So now, in an ideal world, this would be a confidential internal -- dry run [ph]would be a confidential internal target. Given the amount of attention that Tesla receives and the factthat there are several -- or if you count 2 or 3 -- 3 and 4 suppliers, there's several thousand companiesinvolved. It's obviously impossible to keep that confidential, it's not -- you can't. So then, in order to havea consistent message internally, knowing that, that message will also leak externally, that's where the July1 date comes from. There isn't any other way to do it. And if anybody's got better suggestions, I'd liketo hear what they are. So I expect production to occur some point after July 1, and I don't -- but I don'tknow what today would cause us to slip past that date. And if I did, I would take action to address it."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from John Murphy of Bank of America.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionJust the first question is as we think about the 60 kilowatt hour versions of the S and X, I'm just curiousif you could talk about the profitability of those right now versus the other models or sort of the corporateaverage as you see it.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure, so -- go ahead, Elon.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. So I was going to say, because people are optioning up the 60, it actually ends up being decent. Imean, it's not -- I mean, maybe it's sort of like 15% to 20% gross margin, whereas say, something like ifsomebody orders the performance dual motor, that might actually be more like a 30%, 35% gross margin.But there's just a small number of people that want high-performance cars and are willing to pay tripledigits or 6 more -- 6 digits, I should say, so -- but there also remains to be seen how many who orderthe 60 then choose to do the upgrade to the 75 kilowatt hour rate. So there's going to be some number,it's too early to tell, of people who buy it at 60, realize they want the extra range, and then they canjust order a kind of like an in-app purchase on the car's screen and unlock it. I suspect we'll see a prettydecent number of people do that but we don't -- it's still very early. So it's hard to say what number thatwould be. And if they do, do that, then it will push gross margins up into the 20s, like in the mid-20s orsomething.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionOkay, that's helpful. And then just, Jason, maybe just 2 quick sort of housekeeping questions. CapEx,the $2.25 billion, you're running a run rate that's less than half that for the first half of the year. Sojust curious how realistic that number is for the full year because you guys have committed to it in theshareholder letter again. And then also, the auto gross margin going up 200 to 300 basis points off ofwhat base? I'm just -- it's not clear what base that's coming off of. I'm just trying to understand the exitgross margin for the year you're expecting.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure. No problem. So, I mean, I want to add just a little bit of color onto the 60 gross marginnumbers, too."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "We're aspirational on those but the way to think about this is very important. Those carsare gross margin positive, and they're producing cash. So if you think about from an overall operatingleverage perspective, even if the gross margin profile on those is less than our other variants, it's stillproducing contribution margin to pay for the fixed cost of the business. So -- and it's the right economicthing to do. And even more importantly, it's right for the customer to continue to broaden the marketthat way. On your 2 housekeeping questions, your questions on the CapEx front. As you heard in myopening comments, we are deadly focused on CapEx efficiency. So I think we can beat the $2.25 billionnumber, but we didn't see any need to update that guidance at this time. And then your question aboutgross margin on the basis, I was just looking at the quarter-over-quarter. In Q1, automotive gross marginexcluding ZEV credits was 20.1% and we expanded that to 21.9% in Q2 and it's expansion on both the Xand the S variants.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionBut the 2 to 3 points of expansion in Q3 and Q4 is off the 21.9% basic second quarter?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerOh I see, you're asking about the forward-looking.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionYes.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes.

So even 2 or 3 points on gross margin sequentially,that seems below the prior guidance which you then called for 30% to exit the year on the Model S and25% on the Model X. So is it related to the updated mix view on the 60? Was there something else goingon? Or what's the source of the change?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes. No, a couple of things there. And our previous guidance had been approaching 25% on X andapproaching 30% on S. So I think we're maybe a quarter or 2 off on that, but you're pointing to theright things. One is just the mix shift that we're seeing with more Xs being produced. Those margins arehealthy and heading in the right direction, but they're obviously less than S. And now that we're halfwaythrough the year too, we've talked a lot about just the production issues we've had overall. And thosecertainly had an impact on the first half of the year and it's just difficult to make up for all of that in thenext 6 months. And then the impact, you talk about the 60s. The 60s may have some -- one other impacton gross margin.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIt's pretty small though.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerPretty small, yes.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIt's pretty small. I mean, I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll actually meet those numbers by the end ofthe year. Maybe not for Q4 as a whole but exiting Q4, I -- my best guess is we're just under 30% for Sand around 25% for X by the end of this year. And that's what it looks like to me.Joseph Robert SpakRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research DivisionOkay. And then, Elon, just as a philosophical question. I mean, as you transition to an in-house autopilotor autonomous solution, would you consider, in order to help build public support and confidence, aboutreleasing regular reports similar to like Google does on what the technology is doing and open the data?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, unfortunately and fortunately, I mean, Tesla can't sneeze without there being a national headline.So I think you don't have to worry too much about whether we'll report it because the media will and theninflate it in size by 1,000."

MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI mean, actually, with the regulators, we share the data well in advance of -- as soon as we know it. Imean, we shared the data regarding the state of Florida's fatality like a month, I don't know, so manyweeks before it's an actually open investigation. In fact, I mean, we're not totally clear on why they openan investigation because they actually had all the information before they made a formal investigation.Like so it's a little puzzling as to why they -- there was no -- there -- we would have already given themall the information.

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from James Albertine of Consumer Edge Research.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCReal quick, a housekeeping item. I've heard and we saw obviously in the second quarter, there wassome lumpiness in the production and you ended up I think, with 50, 100-or-so vehicles in transit atthe end of the quarter. And I've heard Elon or Jason say stable or stabilization here a few times in thecall. Just want to get a sense for how we should be thinking about the back half deliveries and back halfexpenses. Should it be relatively linear from here as we work toward, for example, your 30% year-over-year expense guidance?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, I mean -- sorry, so I'll just start, say a few words and then Jason can address them. I mean basically,we were in production hell for the first 6 months of this year. I mean, mean, it was hell. And then wejust managed to sort of climb out of hell or -- in like basically part way through June and now we're --the production line is humming. And our suppliers mostly have their sh*t together. There's a few thatdon't. One of them, I know you're visiting on Saturday personally to figure out what the hell is going onthere, but we'll solve it. But I mean just like -- the thing that's crazy hard about cars is that there's severalthousand unique items and you move as fast as the slowest item in the whole car. So yes, but that said,like production is like -- it feels like we're -- I'm not losing sleep at night literally because of the productionissues right now. 2,000 feels like a good number. That was like a slow steady increase in that number. Andthen continue the cost efficiencies which help with gross margin. Some features that are going to comeout, that will also help on the revenue side. And so I feel like actually really good about S and X right now.But I get some -- a whole lot of mental scar tissue from the first 6 months this year. Jason?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes. I think, Elon, you covered it well. In terms of the modeling question, yes, I think it's kind ofextrapolating from where we're at now. We're stable. We'll continue to get better on productionthroughout the course of the year. We've got a couple more holiday weeks in Q4."

But yes, I think Elon covered it well.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCGreat, and if I may\u2026Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSorry, just almost every week, we've see an improvement in labor hours per car which is great from a coststandpoint. Also, the Tesla production team has been working super hard and we don't burn people out.So it's good to see the hours per car come down almost every week as a sign of improved efficiency.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCVery good. I appreciate the additional color. If I may just sneak in a quick follow up on the autonomytopic. Elon, I mean, as we think about the stages of autonomy, I believe NHTSA's sort of outlined sort of5 stages or 0 to 5. And we've seen some competitors of yours outline, with some detail, 2017 to 2020 to2022 type targets. How should we think about sort of your target? Or can you help us sort of dimensiona little bit more your targets in the past to level, I guess, 5? Let's assume for the moment that nothing'schanged, and given the accident in May. And if it has incrementally, that would be helpful but I justwanted to understand, I mean, in more detail, I think, how you plan to get to fully autonomous?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell. Again, major product announcements are not -- it's not -- you -- one shouldn't do those on anearnings call, obviously. So -- I mean all I would say is that full autonomy is going to come a hell a lotfaster than anyone thinks it will. And I think what we've got under development is going to blow people'sminds. It blows my mind too and I get it all the time."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionI had a couple things. One is just following up on Tesla Energy. Can you talk a little bit about the businesspipeline, what's the mix of customers you're selling the product to? And is there a significant contingentof solar? And I wasn't clear on -- there was an earlier question on whether the business is still tracking toaround 500 million this year. Could you just elaborate on that business line?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. It's heavily dependent on the production ramp in the last few months of the year. So the -- like,there's definitely nothing even remotely close to demand constraints on the Tesla Energy side. It's entirelygetting the insuring done and getting it validated, getting your all [ph] certification, scaling up all elementsof the supply chain, and being able to produce in volume. So the reason it's tricky to predict is becausethe volume ramp looks an exponential. And so if you move the dates around even a little bit, it can quitesignificantly change what occurs in a quarter just because the production ramp is an exponential andshifts up a couple of weeks. It can make the quarter look low but actually, it's in vertical climb mode, sothe following quarter will look amazing. So what I'm highly confident of is that the next-generation ofstationary storage is head and shoulders above anything else that I've even heard announced as futureplans from other companies. So it's not -- and so we just got to build those damn things.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionYes. The customers that you're anticipating, are there significant kind of renewables in there? Is itcommercial, residential? What are you sort of seeing or affects the above?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, it's -- we just got to -- we got to scale up production. And production is a hard thing, it's real hard,particularly when it's new technology. If it's some standard technology that's been made for a long time,it's fine. It's cutting-edge technology, it's really hard to scale up reduction. Because you got to design themachine that makes the machine, not just the machine itself and -- but the results can be amazing. Thisis -- like I said, it's going to be head and shoulders above anything else that's -- it's better than anythingI've heard anyone even announce that they will do in the future, and we will do it in the present.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionAnd on the topic of production, you've said some really interesting things about step-function changes inautomotive manufacturing and improving the volumetric efficiency.Elon R."

        "paragraph": "MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, absolutely.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionTypically, as I'm sure you know, the bottlenecks in auto manufacturing are really not in the automatedfunctions like the body shop. They're in things like final trim and assembly that are more labor-intensive,and you've got people crawling in and out of vehicles. Do you see a significant step-function improvementthere like inside-out manufacturing or something like that? And is that something that we're going to seeon the Model 3?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThe Model 3, I mean, the internal name for the designing machine that makes the machine is the --what we call the alien dreadnought. At the point at which the factory looks like an alien dreadnought,then you know you've won. It's like what the hell is that? So we've got alien dreadnought version 0.5is -- will be Model 3. It'll take us another year to get the version 1 and probably, a major version every2 years thereafter. By version 3, it won't look like anything else. It might look like a giant chip pickingplace machine or a super high-speed bottling or canning plant. And you really can't have people in theproduction line itself. Otherwise, you automatically drop to people speed. There's still a lot of people at thefactory but what they're doing is maintaining the machines, upgrading them, dealing with anomalies. Butthere's -- but in the production process itself, there essentially would be no people. But not -- with version1, not version 0.5, so -- but I don't feel or think oh, it's just Tesla's going to have a factory without people.There's going to be a huge number of people, but they will be maintaining the machines and upgradingthe machines and dealing with anomalies, and the output per person will be extraordinarily high.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionSounds like a lot of innovation there. One last just housekeeping thing for Elon or Jason. You hadpreviously talked about the objectives of profitability in the fourth quarter but I know a lot is changingwith the mix and also with the direct leasing. So is that also something that we should think is beingpushed out a quarter?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, if you exclude Model 3 CapEx ramp, then -- well, in fact, really for Q3 and for Q4, Tesla would beprofitable, excluding the Model 3 CapEx ramp."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Pat Archambault of Goldman Sachs.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionTerrific. I guess, just an accounting question maybe for Jason. With the residual value guarantee goingaway, what happens to the accounting for revenues? Do you kind of get to something more close to whatwe see in other OEM financials and maybe just have the portion that's direct lease be accounted for asleases? And what would be the timing of changes assuming they do have them?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes. No, absolutely, and the answer to timing, it changes right away. So a car that is sold without in -- sowith an RVG, that drops us into lease accounting. And what we've done historically and we'll continue todo for RVGs is we recognize the full revenue on a non-GAAP basis. What changes when there's not an RVGin the equation is you get full revenue recognition on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis. So goodthings happen on the accounting side.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay. And then this is something that, I mean, within the next quarter or something, you'll -- we'll alreadysee a significant reduction in that adjustment, obviously.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYou'll see that but the other thing I want to point you to is what we've already talked about and probablyan uptake in direct leasing. When we have used a partner in the past for leasing, that gives us non-GAAPrevenue recognition on that. Our non-GAAP revenue recognition is very simple, we follow the cash. Ifsomebody pays us for -- pays us cash for a car, we recognize it in non-GAAP revenue. When we do directleasing, then that drops us in to pure lease accounting so there, it will be that way on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionAnd I mean, is the 8 to 15, is that just kind of a temporary measure while you're setting up these newpartner relationships? Or do you actually expect to stay at 15 for some time?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSo 15 is what we're talking about for Q3 and I think I mentioned earlier, we've got a bunch of activeconversations with new partners. There's another factor too which is I think, important to point out. We'veintroduced some pretty compelling loan programs, particularly in North America in the last 90 days. Andwe're starting to see some shift from leasing towards loans."

        "paragraph": "And to bring the answer to your question fullcircle, loan is full GAAP and full non-GAAP revenue recognition.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionGot it, that's helpful, and I think it will be helpful for just the users of financial statements as well. TheZEV credits, you mentioned that they weren't material. I feel like it's been written that there was kind ofa glut of supply on those. And I don't know, is that just the lumpiness of it or is that sort of a revenueprocess that's going nowhere?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell actually, if I could say something and I really want to emphasize this quite strongly and I hope itdoes get picked up in the media, is that the California Air Resources Board is being incredibly weak in itsapplication of ZEV credits. The standards are pathetically low. They need to be increased. There's massivelobbying by the big car companies to prevent CARB from increasing the ZEV credits mandate which theyabsolutely damn well should; it's a crying shame that they haven't. And as a result, you can barely sell aZEV credits for pennies on the dollar.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionGot it. Okay so...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderCARB should damn well be ashamed of themselves.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionAll right.

EricksonPacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research DivisionJust had a quick follow-up, I guess, on something that's been asked a couple of times, take another runat it. I guess, given that you're obviously no longer working with this key supplier around full autonomy,what are the major hurdles that you see for Tesla here to overcome to get to full autonomy? It's just acase of software development, lots more miles driven and basically getting the right people in place?Any color on sort of some of the key challenges you're facing and where you're particularly focused fordelivering full autonomy at some point?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, full autonomy is it's really a software limitation. The hardware is -- I mean, the hardware exists tocreate full autonomy, so it's really about developing advanced narrow AI for the car to operate on. AndI want to emphasize narrow AI; it's like not going to take over the world but needs to be really good atdriving a car. So increasingly sophisticated neuro maps that can operate in reasonably sized computers inthe car; that's our focus. I'm very, very optimistic about this. It's exciting, it's really going to -- it blowsme away, the progress we're making.

The first one is on the sharingpiece. So definitely, a very exciting goal. At the same time, I feel like a lot of automakers as well asmunicipalities are all working sort of like on their version of sort of ride sharing through autonomous, Iguess, driverless cars. And to the extent that a lot of sort of what buyers are looking at in Tesla now is thedriving experience and that it really doesn't matter as much when you're being driven, what do you viewas sort of your future competitive advantage in a sort of like ride-sharing type of environment?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI think the quality of the ride is always going to matter. And yes, nobody wants to drive if you're sittingand stuck in traffic, that's boring. But if you're driving on a beautiful country road or along the seaside,then I think it feels wonderful to drive, and you want to do that. So it's -- I don't think cars are going tojust become some boring utility.Emmanuel RosnerCLSA Limited, Research DivisionGot it. And I guess on the piece about expanding the product line out to other major segments. What doyou view as your target timing for that? I know there was a mention of some of these cars being sort oflike -- I guess, at least sort of like available sort of like to be unveiled next year. So does that mean thatwe're looking at sort of like the following year, or is that into the next decade? And what sort of, I guess,capital needs that we're looking at for that?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI think we want to postpone anything that's a heavy capital impact until after the Model 3 productionis ramped. We don't want to stack Model 3 CapEx on top of other program CapEx, so -- but there's alot we can do. Because the development of a vehicle, there's a long sort of tail at the beginning of thedevelopment of a vehicle which involves a lot of time but doesn't involve a lot of cost. And it's only whenyou begin tooling up full production that the cost really ramps dramatically. So there's a lot we can dobefore that -- before we have to sort of dive into ramp CapEx."

But I think there's going to be some pretty exciting unveilsfor the Tesla semi and the Tesla minibus or bus. We have actually -- we don't actually have a name for ityet. That's just off of the Model X platform. So it doesn't involve a lot of CapEx actually. But we expect toprobably unveil those, I think, for the middle of next year, maybe in the next 6 to 9 months type of thing.And then have a better -- a more fleshed out plan for when those would enter production. But it's not --they would enter production within like, low single-digit years, not like -- I mean, I consider like anythingpast 5 years is infinity. Yes, and so I'd say, I mean, also to be clear. Like, the priority vehicle developmentafter the Model 3 would be the Model Y, I guess, the compact SUV because that's also a car that where weexpect to see demand in the 500,000 to 1 million units per year level.

        "paragraph": "The final question comes from the line of Tyler Frank of Robert Baird.Tyler Charles FrankRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionI guess, 2 short questions. One, can you discuss when you expect to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis?And then #2, you had mentioned on the last call that the Gigafactory may actually have the ability toproduce about 3 times of your original estimate? Will that entail significant CapEx in the future or are youpreparing that foundation right now to reach over 100 gigawatt hours?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure. On the profitability question, just reiterate what Elon said earlier. If we can execute on ourproduction and our delivery goals in the second half of the year, we've got a great chance to be non-GAAPprofitable.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, clearly Model 3 CapEx. The real question on profitability is where do we set the dial on growth? Andobviously, if you set the dial on growth to be super high, then you'd face dilution because of that increasedcapital. If you set it too low, there's less dilution but then you grow slower. So you want to set it at kindof the right level where you're the right mix of dilution and growth. I mean, as it is, it's just importantto bear in mind like, as a manufacturing company, our percentage growth, I think it's unprecedentedin the modern era. It's really nutty. I mean, in 2010, we were making 600 cars a year, and Lotus wasdoing most of the -- was doing the chassis -- body and chassis. And then 5 years later, we were making50,000. And it was a much more sophisticated car to Model X, and we were doing the whole car withoutany partner. So when you have like, in same percentage growth like that in a manufacturing company,it's not like you're shipping copies of software here. It's a real tricky, strategic business to where do youset things from a dilution versus growth standpoint. So I mean, the right way to look at the product line,the companies -- look at say the product lines and say -- and value them as that -- sort of do an NPV ofthe product lines. And then, for any given product line, you can say, okay, this is what that is likely to beworth, the S, the X, the 3. And then you can parse it out relative to the CapEx on new vehicles."

And then people willthink Tesla is a money-losing company. Like, well not really. Not if you're growing at like 100% a year or inthe case of next year, I mean, our unit volume, we'll probably exit next year at unit volumes that's 200%or 300% what our current volume is, maybe 400%. So it's just real important to parse things out andto understand what the real health of the business is.
