My name isMartin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja and anumber of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in theupdate that we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss ourbusiness outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on ourpredictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to anumber of risks and uncertainties including those mentioned in our most recent filings with theSEC.During the question and answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and onefollowup. But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some openingremarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. So just a Q3 recap. Our last quarter was impacted by down time for global factoryupgrades that will help us reduce cost per vehicle as well as increase production. We remainfocused on 3 main objectives which is the cost reduction of our products, investments in artificialintelligence, and other growth projects like Optimus. And continued free cash flow generation.Regarding vehicle cost, our team was able to reduce the cost per vehicle further in Q3 despiteheadwinds from factory idle costs and ramp-up of new factories, and we believe there's stillmeaningful room for improvement there.Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicle has now driven over 0.5 billion miles with FSD Beta, FullSelf-Driving Beta, and that number is growing rapidly. We recently completed a 10,000 GPUcluster of H100s. We think probably bringing it into operation faster than anyone's ever brought thatmuch compute per unit time into production since training is the fundamental limiting factor onprogress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.We're also seeing significant promise with FSD Version 12. This is the end-to-end AI where it's aphoton count in, controls out or really you can think of it as there's just a large bit stream coming inand a tiny bit stream going out, compressing reality into a very small set of outputs, which isactually kind of how humans work. The vast majority of human data input is optics, right from oureyes. And so we are, like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in themiddle.",

If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fullyautonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it's not clear what the limit is.Regarding Energy Storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy, of storage products in Q3. And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest-margin business. Energy andservice now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about Cybertruck, I am too. I've driven the car.It's an amazing product. I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reachingvolume production with the Cybertruck and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive. This issimply normal for -- when you've got a product with a lot of new technology or any new -- brand-new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, youwill have problems proportionate to how many new things you're trying to solve at scale. So I justwant to emphasize that, one, I think this is potentially our best product ever, and I think it is our bestproduct ever. It is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cashflow positive at a price that people can afford.Often, people do not understand what is truly hard. That's why I say prototypes are easy, productionis hard. People think it's the idea or you make a prototype, you design a car. And as soon asdesigning a car is -- it's not just anyone can do it. It does require taste. It does require effort todesign a prototype. But the difficulty of going from a prototype to volume production is like10,000% harder to get to volume production than to make the prototype in the first place. And thenit is even harder than that to reach positive cash flow. That is why there have not been new car start-ups that have been successful for 100 years apart from Tesla.So I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck. It's a great product.",

Soit's not a demand issue, but we have to make it, and we need to make it at a price that people canafford; insanely difficult things.In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining a positive cash flow,and we continue to target and expect to have around 1.8 million vehicle deliveries, as stated earlierthis year. The Tesla AI team is, I think, one of the world's best, and I think it is actually by far theworld's best when it comes to real-world AI.

Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another recordquarter of profitability in our energy business. Congratulations to the Tesla team for their continuedfocus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, higherinterest rates and shifting consumer sentiment.As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planneddowntimes for our factory upgrades. This was necessary to allow for further factory improvementsand production rate increases. Despite those factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased toapproximately $37,500. We saw sequential decreases in material costs and freight. Reducing thecost of our vehicles is our top priority.On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continue to rise due to Cybertruck prototype buildsand pilot production testing, combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving Optimusand Dojo. We have and will continue to make investments in these areas and hence, our capitalexpenditure and R&D will continue to grow in the near term.However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations.This year itself we have generated operating cash flows of approximately $8.9 billion and free cashflows of approximately $2.3 billion.Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a stand-alone basis, with Energy businessleading the charge primarily from the growth in megabyte deployments. Our Services and Otherbusinesses, on a year-on-year basis, also continued to show positive momentum as we benefit fromour growing fleet.As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate thatmost car buying happens with one or other form of financing. And hence, we also view pricing interms of monthly costs for the customer. And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risensubstantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.We've tried to offset such adjustments via our focus on reducing costs.",

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI scruple to make an accurate guess at this point, going back to what I said earlier that the ramp isgoing to be extremely difficult. And like I said, there's no way around that. If you try to make -- ifwe just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally 200 models that are slightvariations on a theme in the combustion engine world, just distinctions without a difference, thenit's really not that hard. But if you want to do something radical and innovative and somethingreally special like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because there's nothing to copy. You haveto invent it, not just the car but the way to make the car.So the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome. Now I can say that -- if yousay, \"Well, where will things end up,\" I think we'll end up with roughly 0.25 million Cybertrucks ayear, and -- but we're not -- I don't think we're going to reach that output rate next year. I think we'llprobably reach it sometime in 2025. That's my best guess.",

The second question is can you provide a progress update on the 4680 cell, particularlyprogress towards performance improvements and cost savings outlined on Battery Day?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSure thing, Martin. 4680 cell production in Texas increased 40% quarter-over-quarter. Congrats tothe Texas team for producing their 20 millionth cell off of line 1. Texas is now our primary 4680facility. We're heavily focused on quality. Scrap is down 40% quarter-over-quarter. With theincreased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month over monthwithin the quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady-state goals. Andthat is our priority.The Cybertruck cell, with 10% higher energy than our Model Y cell, started production on line 2 inTexas. This quarter, we convert to building 100% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factoryas we ramp all 4 lines in Phase 1 over the next 3 quarters. Phase 2 of the Texas 4680 facility iscurrently under construction. The additional 4 lines incorporate further capital efficiencies overPhase 1, and our target is for them to start producing in late 2024.Lastly, in Kato, we're retooling to enable large-scale pilot runs of our next-generation cell designs.Kato's long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our massproduction facilities, enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp-ups of new designs.",

The next question from Institutional Investor is, could you please provide an update oncapacity expansion plans for company's factories in Berlin and Austin and the opening schedule ofGigafactory in Mexico?Unidentified Company Representative -Berlin and Austin factory, the current priority is actually to maximize the output from our existinglines by laser focusing on efficiency improvements. As always, maintaining a high quality andreducing per unit cost will be as critical as growing the production volume. For Mexico, we areworking on infrastructure and factory design in parallel with the engineering development of thenew production that we will be manufacturing there. That's what I can share for that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIn Mexico, we're laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items, butI think we want to just get a sense for what the global economy is like before we go full tilt on theMexico factory. I am worried about the high interest rate environment that we're in. It's -- I just can'temphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment.And as interest rates rise, the proportion of that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally.So that's -- if interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it's that much harder to -- forpeople to buy the car. They simply can't afford it.So -- and we are tracking, I believe, at this point for Model Y to be the best selling car on earth, notjust in revenue but in unit value. If you compare that to the other vehicles that are #2 and #3 andwhatnot, they cost much less than our car. So we're just hitting the law of large numbers situationshere.I know people want us advertising. We are advertising. I think there is something to be gained onthe advertising front. I don't think it's nothing. But informing people of a car that is great but theycannot afford doesn't really help. So that is really the thing that must be sold, is to make the caraffordable or the average person cannot buy it for any amount of money. They simply can't afford it.They can't afford it, so this is a big deal.",

What excites you most about how this project is progressing?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, the robotaxi is, I guess, certainly nondriven. The -- I guess, I am very excited about ourprogress with autonomy. The end-to-end, nothing but net, self-driving software is amazing. I --drives me around Austin with no interventions. So it's clearly the right move. So it's really prettyamazing. And obviously, that same software and approach will enable Optimus to do useful thingsand enable Optimus to learn how to do things simply by looking. So extremely exciting in the longterm.As I've mentioned before, given that the economic output is the number of people timesproductivity, if you no longer have a constraint on people, effectively, you've got a humanoid robotthat can do as much as you'd like, your economy is twice the infinite or infinite for all intents andpurposes. So I don't think anyone is going to do it better than Tesla, not by a long shot. BostonDynamics is impressive, but their robot lacks the brain. They're like the Wizard of Oz or whatever.Yes, lacks the brain. And then you also need to be able to design the humanoid robot in such a waythat it can be mass manufactured. And then at some point, the robots will manufacture the robots.And obviously, we need to make sure that it's a good place for humans in that future. We do notcreate some variance of the Terminator outcome. So we're going to put a lot of effort into localizedcontrol of the humanoid robot. So basically, anyone will be able to shut it off locally, and you can'tchange that even if you put -- like a software update, you can't change that. It has to be hard-coded.",

What steps is Tesla taking to make thistechnology available outside the U.S.?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, our approach has been to try to get it -- like, the more places we're trying to make it work, theharder the problem is. So the reason we don't do it in all countries simultaneously is that it wouldtake much longer to make it work anywhere at all. So that's why it's currently just North America.And also for most parts of the world, you have to get approval before deploying things, whereas inthe U.S., you can deploy things at risk or at least you can take liability for what you're deploying.So it's a -- whereas most countries require some sort of extensive approval program. So we onlywant to go through that extensive approval program when we think it's kind of ready for prime timein that country.I apologize it's not out in those countries, but we keep finding ways to make it better. And it really --it needs to drive such that it exceeds even the unsupervised, significantly exceeds the probability ofinjury of a human or significantly better, a lower probability of injury than a human by far. I thinkwe're tracking to that point very quickly.Obviously, in the past, I've been overly optimistic about this. The reason I've been overly optimisticis that the progress tends to sort of look like a log curve, which is that you have kind of rapid initialimprovements that if you were to extrapolate that sort of rapid, fairly linear rate of improvement,you get to self-driving quite quickly, but then the rate of improvement curves over logarithmicallyas well as the asymptote. That's now happened several times. I would characterize our progress inreal world AI as a series of stacked log curves. I think that's also true in other parts of AI, like[LOMs] and whatnot, a series of stacked log curves. Each log curve gets higher than the last one.So if we keep stacking them, we keep stacking logs, eventually, we get to FSD.",

The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist.William Stein - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MDWe learned earlier on the call, it sounds like you don't think the truck will ramp to significantvolume until its third year of production. Should we have a similar anticipation for the ramp of thenext-gen platform? Or is there any reason that we should be maybe more optimistic or pessimisticabout the ramp profile there?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, to be clear, it's not really the third year of production. It's kind of like the 18th monthof production is roughly my guess. So it's just that they happen -- it will happen if not the -- it startsthis year, spans next year and gets to 2025. So technically, there are 3 calendar years in there, butthere's actually only 18 months, not 3 years. I would be very disappointed if it took us -- and thatwould be shocking if it took us 3 years. But 18 months from initial deliveries to have -- to reachvolume and reach prosperity with an immense -- I can't tell you how much -- the blood, sweat andtears level required to achieve that is just staggering.

So I agree with you that asFSD improves, we should see its value increasing. But I guess like the ultimate values of FSD,which is to be able to handle like a robotaxi is not going to necessarily interest everybody, and youhave a bit of a degraded version that would be like a chauffeur service where the car drives byitself, but you still have to be in the car and around. And then there is like the hands-on, eyes-onversion of the service. And I guess, there should be like much lower cost, lower feature kind ofvariance of the service that could have a very large penetration on your installed base and a moreexpensive one that would remain at a lower penetration level. So I'm just wondering if you're takingthat.And last but not least, like the simplest version of FSD available are going to work from a technicalperspective, probably before like the ultimate robotaxi version can work, if ever. And so I'mwondering how you take that into account and how you're thinking like the financial contribution ofFSD over time and whether you could evolve your pricing along that kind of tiers to increaseadoption?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, a fully autonomous vehicle, I think, Pierre, the sort of the economics of an autonomousvehicle are truly astounding in a positive way.

And just as a follow-up, obviously, price is also a driver of demand, but that's obviously nothappening in a vacuum. And you mentioned that -- I think you mentioned at some point during thiscall that you're also maybe hitting the law of large numbers on some of your products. Can you justshare how you're thinking about price elasticity just at this point in this macro environment, and anythoughts along those lines?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think that there's very significant price elasticity. I mean to be totally frank, if our car costs thesame as a Rav4, nobody would buy a Rav4, or at least they're very unlikely to. It's worth noting thata lot of these incentives like the tax credit and whatnot, they're actually very difficult for the averageperson to access because they -- most people do not have $10,000 or even $7,500 burning a hole intheir bank account. A lot of -- a large number of people are living paycheck to paycheck and with alot of debt. They've got credit card debt, mortgage debt. So yes, it's -- that's reality for most people.It's sometimes difficult for people who are high income earners, and when I say high, it'd be likesomeone who's earning over $200,000 a year, to understand what life is like for someone who isearning $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a year, which is most people.So like, for a lot of people, like, this tax credit just -- they can't front $7,500 for 18 months or even 6months to -- for the tax credit, and they actually don't, in some cases even have that [an ancillary$7,500] in taxes. So it's really just the vast regard to people is how much money do they have to payimmediately and how much per month. That's it. You can stop right there. And our car is still muchmore expensive than a Rav4 when you look at it that way.Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOOne other thing which I'll add, when you look at car buying in general, we're trying to get to thenext set of EV adopters.Elon R.

So -- and the computer never gets tired and never gets distracted, getdrunk, hopefully.And so radar is -- what really matters is how much does it affect the probability of an accident. Andin order for the radar to be effective, you have to be able to do radar-only braking or you have to doactions that are radar only. Otherwise, you get this disambiguation problem between vision andradar. That's why we actually turned off the radar in cars historically that we had chipped.

That's why I'd call this, sort of any fool that -- like, if you want to like lose weightand you said, \"Well, I need to lose 15 pounds right away,\" well, you could chop your arm off, butthen you're sitting here with one arm, and you're still fat. So like...Unidentified Company Representative -You got to work out.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, you actually have to eat less food and work out. That's the actual way.Unidentified Company Representative -And you need doctor's advice.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. It's not super fun because food is delicious. And personally, I'm not -- I don't love working out.I know some of you do. I wish I did, but I don't.

Do you hear me now?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes.Colin M. Langan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity AnalystYou said in the commentary that you're not going full tilt on the plant in Mexico until there aresigns that the economy is strong. Can you continue at a 50% CAGR without that plant? And wherewould that come from? And any color on what you mean of sort of not going full tilt? Could thatplant get delayed indefinitely? Or what are you kind of talking about?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorNo, we're definitely making the factory in Mexico. We feel very good about that. We've put a lot ofeffort into looking at different locations, and we feel very good about that location, and we aregoing to build a factory there and it's going to be great. The question is really just one of timing.And it's going to be a broken record on the interest front. It's just the interest rates have to comedown. Like, if interest rates keep rising, you just fundamentally reduce affordability. It is just thesame as increasing the price of the car. So I just don't have visibility into -- if you can tell me whatthe interest rates are, I can tell you when we should build the factory. We're going to build it. And Imean we think we'll start the initial phases of construction next year.But I am still somewhat scarred by 2009 when General Motors and Chrysler went bankrupt. So --while that's now 14 years ago, it's -- that is seared into my mind with a branding iron because kindof Tesla was just hanging on by a thread during that entire time and with -- I mean, we closed ourfinancing round 2008 at 6 p.m. December 24, Christmas Eve. And if we had not closed thatfinancing round, we would have bounced payroll 2 days after Christmas. So we actually closed thatround at the last hour, at the last day that it was possible. Stressful, to say the least, and then barelymade it through 2009. So I'm like I want to just -- I don't want to be going at top speed intouncertainty.",
