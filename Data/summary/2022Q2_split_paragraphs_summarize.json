Our Q2 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Timein the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ﬁlings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you, Martin. So just as a Q2 recap, Q2 was a unique quarter for Tesla due to a prolongedshutdown of our Shanghai factory. But in spite of all these challenges, it was one of the strongestquarters in our history. Most importantly, in June, we achieved production records in both Fremontand Shanghai. And as a result, we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.I do want to emphasize this is obviously subject to force majeure, things outside of our control. Thepast few years have been quite a few force majeures, and it's been kind of supply chain hell forseveral years. Credit to our awesome Tesla supply chain team for overcoming in saving difﬁcultchallenges. And huge thanks to the Tesla Shanghai factory team who sacriﬁced a lot to get thefactory back up and running in June and achieve a record output.So also making good progress with production ramp with Berlin. We achieved an importantmilestone of 1,000 cars a week in June. And we're expecting -- sorry, our Giga Texas to exceed the1,000-vehicle per week milestone and hopefully in the next few months.To be clear, we're currently making the cars with the 2170 cells, and Drew Baglino will addresssome of the 4680 questions later in this call. But it is worth emphasizing that we have enough 2170cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of the year. So we're not dependent on 4680.4680 will be important next year but it is not important for this year.That said, we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells inTexas. And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expandcapacity.Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD Beta with City Streets driving capability toover 100,000 owners.",

        "original_text": "They're very happy with the capability of the system and we'll continue toimprove it every week. We've now driven over 35 million miles with FSD Beta. That's moreautonomous miles than any company we're aware of, I think probably more than -- it might be more than any -- all other companies combined. So -- and that mileage is growing exponentially.With regard to manufacturing and technology, about 5 or 6 years ago, we said we wanted to becomethe best manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat counterintuitively, to some people, willactually be, I think, our strongest competitive advantage. We're super pro-manufacturing here atTesla. And in general, we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing. Andin general, I think it is a very important thing to do. We need to make stuff and make it efﬁcientlyand that's manufacturing.So we've made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes. As we now show in theshareholder deck, thanks to our -- the large castings, we make the world's largest castings. Wereduced body welding robot count by 70% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin. So that's, callit, roughly a body shop that is roughly 3x smaller than would normally be the case. And I shouldsay it's also lighter, cheaper and has superior noise vibration harshness. So it's good on every level.But this journey is not over. We'll bring another level of simplicity and manufacturingimprovements with Cybertruck and future products that we're not quite ready to talk about now butI think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detectsimminent collision, which has never been done before. So you can imagine that if you have aseatbelt that only tensions upon impact, you have very little time to tension the seatbelt. If you'vegot to be -- the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner. But because we havevision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with 100% probability before it actuallyhappens.And so we can tension the seat belts, and we can even adjust the airbag deployment because we cansee, not just feel. This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer. Andthere's also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have atleast AP3 hardware.In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.",

I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team on an excellent executionduring the second quarter. Although our production volume reduced sequentially due to COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, we made substantial progress in nearly every area of the business,and in particular, our global vehicle production rate as we exited the quarter.Our Fremont factory, supported by our Reno team, reached new production records. The Shanghaifactory resumed full production, and our new factories in Austin and Berlin are progressing wellthrough their initial ramps.Additionally, our energy business achieved record gross proﬁt with the highest solar volumes inmany years. I want to personally thank the entire Tesla team, as I know many of you are listening.You've embodied a remarkable and relentless pursuit of excellence in support of our mission. I alsowant to thank our suppliers for their support during another complicated quarter.On GAAP automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to 27.9%. The temporary decline inShanghai production volume meaningfully impacted margin, including idle capacity and factoryrestart costs and also had implications on the mix of regional deliveries.Additionally, as discussed on previous calls, we are working through the ramp inefﬁciencies of ournew factories, which are progressing well but have had an impact on margin as those factories comeonline. While we continue to see a beneﬁt from higher pricing ﬂowing through, which experiencedsome foreign exchange-related headwinds, our cost structure continues to experience cost increasesfrom inﬂation, commodities and logistics.The energy business progressed well in Q2, aided by alternate solar supply coming online andprogress on unit economics. Our storage business remains component-constrained on bothPowerwall and Megapack, which we hope will alleviate to some extent in the second half of theyear. We are greatly appreciative of the patience and ﬂexibility shown by our customers while wework through these challenges.Within operating expenses, Boston and Berlin-related start-up costs have wound down as thesefactories have moved into production and their costs are now reﬂected in automotive COGS.Additionally, we converted a majority of our Bitcoin holdings to ﬁat for a realized gain, offset byimpairment charges on the remainder of our holdings, netting a $106 million cost to the P&Lincluded within restructuring and other. We also incurred restructuring charges related to targetedstafﬁng reductions.Elon R.

If the latter, can you explain whatmakes it a difﬁcult problem in layman terms?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorOkay. This answer will be understood by 0.01% of the audience, I think. I suppose people want toﬁnd out what a uniﬁed factory space would actually mean. It essentially would be if you can take --if instead of netting together static and dynamic objects in C++, if they could be net together at theneural net level, then you don't need to reconcile them within C++ heuristics.That is an architecturally better way to -- that's the most desirable outcome. It's -- I think it'sprobably not necessary to achieve full self-driving, but it would be a slight improvement in theefﬁciency of the self-driving. And it's certainly something we want to get to. Yes. The sort ofnirvana situation is you have surround video/auto labeling of all static and dynamic objects. Andyou have then surround video inference with spatial memory as well.Then that's -- I mean, I think we're almost certainly there before the end of the year. Yes, I'm notsure how many you would understand that.

Can you elaborate on what do you mean by cooling down and how aggressively thecompany will lower prices? More broadly, how do you think about the auto pricing long term?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. So since we have -- there's a quite a long wait when somebody orders in a car, in some cases, 6months; in some cases, it could be up to a year. We have to anticipate what the probable inﬂationrate is over that period of time. So that's what we're trying to do. When we -- when or if we seeindications that the inﬂation rate is declining, then we would not need to increase our car prices. It'spossible that there could be a slight decrease in car prices, but this is fundamentally dependent onmacroeconomic inﬂation. It's not something we control.If I were to guess, and I would take this with a grain of salt, I think inﬂation will decline towardsthe end of this year.

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, do you want to do the architecture?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. So structural pack where we get dual use of the battery cells as structure and as energy storagein the same way that an aircraft gets dual use of the wing as a fuel tank and as a wing is, I think,unequivocally, from a physics standpoint, the superior architecture. It's the A architecture.Now because it is new, we'll start off getting, I don't know, aspirationally a C within an Aarchitecture. But the potential is there for to get radically better and then unequivocally better than abattery pack, which is carried like a sack of potatoes.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. And we've gained the perspective through putting our ﬁrst structural pack in production that itis actually the A architecture.

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. So we are making progress on 4680. But right now, as Elon mentioned, we are leveragingsupplier cells, which we have in sufﬁcient quantity to ramp Texas and Berlin. We expect to ramptotal 4680 production to exceed 1,000 per week by the end of the year, hopefully before -- wellbefore.In Q2, at Kato we fully automated (inaudible) for the dry anode-electrode tool there, unlockingmajor increases in production and improvements in yields. Since March because of that, Katooutput has grown about 35% month-over-month each month since, and yields throughout thefactory are already at targets in most areas and trending in that direction and a few others.We did feed learnings from Fremont cell and pack lines to Texas and Berlin there, a carbon copy.Cell design was revved to unlock higher performance and manufacturing simplicity. Manufacturinglines were further integrated and we in-sourced additional content. For these reasons, there are somenew ramp challenges to overcome in Texas and Berlin.Speciﬁc to Texas last quarter, cell equipment was fully installed and commissioned and weproduced our ﬁrst commissioning car sets of cells through the end of the line. Our target for Texasis to begin production this quarter and aim for Texas to be capable of exceeding Kato weekly outputbefore the end of this year.",

How isthe situation with regards to supply of semiconductors, battery cells and other components? Howabout cost inﬂation impacting proﬁtability of these other plants?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringI can take that. So Tesla procures about 1,600 unique pieces of silicon from 43 semiconductorcompanies. So with a portfolio of that size, there are always challenges. Things are more stable onthe latest generation chips. We still see some tightness in the older generation semiconductors,especially in the analog and mixed signal space. But we have line of sight to solve for the volumesbeing contemplated for both Austin and Berlin.And on the cell front, like Elon mentioned, we have a comfortable margin, thanks to record outputfrom our partners and have line of sight that matches the planned output from both factories. We'vegrown cell production signiﬁcantly on a 12-month rolling basis and have long-term contracts withall our partners for key battery metals. So we don't see any major problems for the components, ofcourse, barring unforeseen COVID-related shutdowns.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOJust to add on the proﬁtability part of the question. Q2 was our largest increase yet over the lasthandful of quarters on inﬂation and commodity-related increases to our cars. It's fairly evenlyspread across the factories, given common suppliers or common issues that impact the broad supplychain.So I think I had mentioned before that we have been seeing increases over the course of last year. Itticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2. So as we lookthrough to the end of the year, what we're seeing is we don't think the inﬂation-related increases inQ3 will be as big as Q2. But as Elon has mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.And we don't have full exposure, as [Karen] had just mentioned, on every component of costbecause we do have some contracts in place. But there are some spot buys as well and somecontracts being renegotiated. So we're managing it with pricing and in partnership with oursuppliers but it does continue to be something that is impacting our ﬁnancials.",

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureI'd like to ask like a question on 4680 and the structural battery pack. And I'd love to understandwhere you stand on the technology and efﬁciency and energy density road map that you describedat the Battery Day. So what I'm trying to understand is where do you stand on the architecture of thebattery cell itself? How much silicon do you have in it? How much energy improvement have youachieved already so far?And the reason why I'm asking that is because you have like very smart guys on Twitter who sharedexperience about trying to fully empty a Model Y from Texas from Austin and noticing behaviorsand like recharging behavior that suggested that maybe these cars had like very, very high mileage,very high range, and were like artiﬁcially limited in range in software. So I'm just kind of trying tounderstand how much of an edge you're building at the moment with the 4680 and the battery backon range.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Let me just try to provide like a super straightforward answer. Like as Elon mentioned before,our priority was really on simplicity and scale during the initial 4680 and structural battery ramp.So we weren't like putting all the bells and whistles in from day 1 because if so, we would be sort ofsuffering under a string of serious miracles that we would need to achieve to get going.But as we attain the manufacturing goals that we've stated at the ramp that we need to hit next year,we are certainly planning to layer in new material technologies and higher-range structural packs,like we're not like holding back goodies for some rainy day or something like that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Maybe another way of putting it is that the -- our focus right now is on the dozens of littleissues that inhibit the production ramp of the 4680. Some of the more challenging ones have beenfeeding the anode-cathode material because we're using this revolutionary dry electrode process.But when something is revolutionary, it's a lot of unknowns that have to be resolved.So we're conﬁdent of resolving those unknowns but it's very, very difﬁcult.",

It's growing fast with the faster itgrows, the faster we transition to a sustainable energy economy.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureThis is actually a great -- exactly where my follow-up is. So Elon, you always mention this 50% perannum sustainable growth target that you guys have. And so my question here is when we see likethe difﬁculty regarding the commodities, raw materials, swinging prices, I'm kind of wondering, asyou are planning for this 50% per annum growth, if we stand today over the next 5 to 10 years, howmuch of that do you feel you've secured through your work at entering into long-term contracts andthings like that? And you were calling for entrepreneurs to go into the lithium business.So does that mean you don't have enough lithium secured to grow 50% per annum over multipleyears? And what's -- how much of that is secured today? And how fast can you improve thatbasically?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, I think it's kind of very difﬁcult to predict anything 10 years from now. I hope civilization isstill around, frankly.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. Hopefully, we haven't had World War III by then. So the -- we do see constraints inreﬁning of the materials necessary for lithium ion batteries. I do want to emphasize this as -- it isnot due to a scarcity of the raw material. In the case of lithium, lithium is one of the most commonelements on Earth. It's pretty much everywhere.But reﬁning of the lithium into ultra-high purity battery-grade lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonateis quite difﬁcult and requires a massive amount of machinery and it's a hard thing to scale. As it wasalso difﬁcult to create the anode and cathode.I think -- my guess is maybe 2/3 of batteries will be iron phosphate or maybe iron phosphate withsome manganese.

But the demand is not something we spend really any timetalking about.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I think it's -- maybe just 1 thing worth mentioning the -- that there is surface between value formoney and fundamental affordability because sometimes people say, \"Well, if you got all thisdemand. Why don't you just raise the price to some -- double the price or something?\" And this isusually expressed by somebody who's rich.But there's -- even if you rail value for money to inﬁnity, if somebody does concerns, do not haveenough money to buy it, even a product where the desirability is rail to inﬁnity, they basicallycannot buy it.

Tesla's obviously changed dramatically in thelast 3 years from near life or death to a company with consistent cash ﬂow and industry-leadingmargins. I'm wondering if you can comment on your personal role in the company and whether yousee that changing in terms of your role, your commitment and time spent at the company over thenext 3 or 4 years.I think you said a few calls ago, you wouldn't be on calls unless there's something unusual andyou've been on every call since then. I'm wondering.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI do a lot of unusual things, let's face it. Basically, if there's only good news, I won't be on the call.But if you have like a tough situation like COVID shutdowns in China, then I think I'll be on thecall -- relatively speaking, if there's bad news. And we have this good news, then I won't be on thecall.But I'm committed to the long -- I mean, I'll work at Tesla as long as I can usefully advance thecause of sustainability and autonomy.",

The next question comes from William Stein.William Stein - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MDElon, in the past, you've given some assessment as to the likelihood that you can achieve success insome of the more interesting AI-oriented efforts, not only FSD but also Dojo and Optimus. Perhapsyou can give an updated view on those.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, I don't want to steal thunder from AI Day. So I think we'll have some exciting news on AIDay that I think will be further ahead than probably most people think. But I don't want to -- I'dlove to answer you but I think we'll leave that excitement for AI Day.William Stein - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MDOkay. And perhaps a follow-up if I can. We've heard a lot from others and certainly to some degreefrom you all about the shortages in semiconductors, in particular. We have seen some big, importantcustomers of that type of product decide to sort of leverage the ecosystems that exist to make someof their own in those categories.I'm wondering to what degree you're doing that. That's outside of Dojo in terms of the -- I guess, onthe inference side, you're certainly doing that in the car, but what about sort of the more mundaneareas like microcontrollers and the like? Is there any internal effort to improve supply chain andmaybe improve other performance aspects?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, there's we've done -- we've been working with our suppliers side. We don't currently intend tomake chips ourselves. We don't think there will be a need to make chips, but we have been workingclosely with a number of suppliers. Actually just met with one of our key supplier's CEOs rightbefore this call. We had a great meeting. They're going to make major investments in some of thecritical chips and components that we need in the car.And I'd actually like to take a moment to thank our key suppliers once again for supporting usthrough difﬁcult times. And they really went above and beyond to support us. So to all our suppliersout there, thanks very much.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. And I guess just maybe we don't talk about it very often, but we do have a lot of custom siliconin the vehicle already. Microcontrollers, yes, some battery management, yes, some powerelectronics, yes, some.",

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & Director(inaudible) even now where the supply chain issues with our Tier 1s and Tier 2s, get into it with uson the engineering side when we ﬁnd solutions, whether it's alternative chips or changing the entirestructure of this pack to make it work. And I think that's an advantage we have that many other OEsjust simply cannot.I think Tesla is as much a software company as it is a hardware company. And so one of the waysthat we've been able to address supply chain issues on the chip front is by rewriting of software tobe able to use different chips or, in some cases, achieve dual use of a single chip, which is evenbetter. And actually, quite frankly, the chip shortage has served as a forcing function for us toreduce the number of chips in the car. Yes, it turns out we had more chips than we needed.But that's a testament to our software team that we're able to roll a new chip into the car, write awhole new patch of software for that chip and -- without interrupting production.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. And our goal is as we mature and scale the platforms is to integrate more functionality intofewer chips, like that is the way that it's gone with laptops and phones. It's going that way in cars.And we're trying to do that wherever it makes sense to do it as quickly as we can.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorFrom a supply chain standpoint, do we -- what do you think about the chips and whatnot?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. I think -- I mean, from a high level, instead of designing and building our ownmicrocontrollers, we're partnering with key partners that understand the architectural requirementsand they'll take the specs and design something for us. We've done that, to your point, the batterysensing space. We've got some application-speciﬁc ICs. But yes, integrating, reducing the numberof components, it's a mix of supply chain but it also makes the reliability of the end product betterbecause there's less failure points. So that's always been the mantra.Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc.",
