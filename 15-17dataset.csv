"The production ramp just scales exponentially, depending upon where thatexponential curve falls across a quarterly boundary. So that's why it's like -- it's easy --it's a lot easier to predict it sort of continuous than if it's discrete with offshore [ph] quarterly cut-offs. But I really think the X is going to be --It's really going tobe a great car. I just drove the latest prototypetoday, and it'sLike, wow, this is by far the best SUV. And yes, so I'm feeling pretty goodabout things. But because that production rampJust scales exponentially. It can actually make quite significant -- make quitea significant effect on the production and deliveries in that quarter.",positive,0.919618159532547

That has been varying over time, the amount ofZEV credits we earn. And as more of our production goes overseas, obviously, there's no ZEV statesoverseas. So this islike -- the ZEV stuff is like an increasingly small part of the picture over time.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes.

SolarCity is only operating in the U.S. and the power wall, it will be available from SolarCity and fromother installers in both configurations. But if someone is doing a daily cycling application, they're doing itout of -- because they specifically want grid independence. And there's some number of people who willwant to do that, and that's good. But it's also important to appreciate like even to say the power backupsystems, so that you always have power in the event of a power outage, if -- like let's say that appealsto like like 2% of households in the United States or 1%.

"Elon R. Musk: Ithink we'll see demand for stationary storage as measured in sort of megawatt hours or gigawatts hoursto be approximately double that of the car. That's our best guess for long-term demand yet. And then in terms of volume, I mean, we're going totry to scale it as fast as we can -- as the slowest manufacturing constraint. And there's just one's meant for, call it maybe 60 or 70 cycles per year. And the other one ismeant for daily cycling -- daily deep cycling, so it's 365 cycles a year. So thebackup power chemistry is quite similar to the car, which is like a nickel cobalt aluminum cathode. Thedaily cycling control [ph] constituent is nickel manganese cobalt, so there's quite a lot of mangenesein there.",neutral,0.6188641786575317
"Elon R. Musk: We're trying to figure out if we can go from like our current production target of like 35 gigawatthours at cell level and 50 at the pack level in our Nevada plant. We could easily have the entireGigafactory just do stationary storage. It's like wow, okay, we need to make cars, too. So we should try to make the factory bigger. It seems like the logical thing to do, so we're going to probably try to do that, yes.Jeffrey B.

So I think that's going to be a great benefit for reliability and just longevity of the pack.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsAnd one for Deepak. Would you be willing to provide any breakdown of the capital -- the CapEx spendingin Q1?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThe CapEx Spending was primarily driven by the capacity expansion that we're doing for Model X,including the tooling spend. And then, of course, we are putting in the new paint shop, which is a verysignificant investment. That will be ready in Q3. Andthen we have also had investments in the Gigafactoryand our sales and service network. That's probably the order in which we've been spending.",positive,0.6202150583267212

But if there's something better, we can alsoadjust and change over time. So there's a lot of flexibility.Jeffrey B. Straubel: We have multiple lines operating inthe Gigafactory, so if one line is building nickel cobalt aluminum chemistry and another is building Nickelmanganese cobalt, that still works just fine.

"If you had the capacity today, how long would do you think it would take for you to get to that15 gigawatt hours? Also related to this business, it seems like you're using third parties for most of thedistribution, installation. So if you achieved maybe a 20% gross margin, can you pass along any thoughts on how we should be thinking in terms of SG&A is allocated?Elon R. Musk: I think it's pretty early days to -- I mean, we're being super-speculative at this point. So it's...Jeffrey B. Straubel: We're only focusing on that approach for power wall in most case-- in most cases.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay, got it. On the auto business, do you have any preliminary expectations on the mix of the 70Dversus 85? Any Thoughts on how that affects margins? And lastly, a question for Deepak. He asked about the fact that a DC/AC inverter is already there for solar. So I think maybe one way to think of it is, if the battery pack, the power wall,with its internal DC to DC converter, can act much like a solar panel",neutral,0.8095846772193909
"In the past,we were able to look at your supplemental information on leasing where you disclose the value of theleases delivered and the value that you're booking this at on the balance sheet. And it sort of approximated your gross margins, but this quarter, when you do the math, the impliedmargins were something like 44%, not like 29%, 30%. Is there something unusual there?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerI'll answer the second one. No, there's nothing unusual in those numbers as the overall. What you'reseeing in the supplemental information is the new cars we've delivered. What's coming through ultimatelyis the cumulative impact of all the leasing that we have done.Elon R. Musk: It's still pretty early to be predicting mix because you have to distinguish between what's sort ofinitial demand versus sustained demand. So I mean, it looks like there may be -- going to be comparablenumber of 70s versus 85s. But it's difficult to -- this is extrapolating on very little information.",neutral,0.7788790464401245
"Some of the different revenue streams you're talking about are kind of mixed between power pack andpower wall. The BMS system lives inside the battery pack in both cases. In some cases, the inverter may be the system that's deciding how tomanage energy in the overall house. And in terms of the size, we really -- for power wall again, we optimized the size around whatwas the most common photovoltaic size and also what we felt was kind of the smallest modular incrementfor backup. Having10 kilowatt hours doesn't mean that you can't very easily put in 20 or 30 or 40. But we felt 10 kiloatt hourswas the lowest kind of common element.",neutral,0.6911797225475311
"Elon R. Musk: It's possible. All we know rightnow is like we have demand, like, well in excess of our production ramp. Andyes, that's where we get to like the kind of 2 billion power pack number. That's kind of the number you need to get to go fully electric. Butwhere things -- how things track between now and then, it's difficult to predict. But ultimately, we thinkthings will get there, it could take a long time, but that'skind of where we think things will end up. That was sort of our global macro calculations. And yes, that is where we're headed, but where things will get to is hard to predict right now.",neutral,0.582762748003006

We are hoping to show off the Model 3 in approximately March of next year. And then be in production with Model3 in the -- I'd like to say mid, but probably closer to the late 2017 time frame.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research Division.

"The fourth quarter cash flow guidance does not include income from those warehouse facilities to offset leased vehicles. The price increase that we've announced is not going to help us in Q2 given our book ofbusiness. And so ourreal cash flow in Q1 was driven by the strong CapEx spend ahead of the Model X launches, the way wetend to look at the business internally. The other quick question I had is just I was a little surprised by the-- I think you guys had obviously very good gross margins this quarter relative to some of the headwinds you were facing.

Then just lastly, as we think about the cash burn in the quarter, but alsothe setup of the credit lines, it seems like you guys are recognizing that at some point down the line, theremight be a need for a capital raise.

Basically, thatwill be our minimum cash position.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionNo, I think the risk reduction function you mentioned is probably the most valuable, and that's kind of why we're asking about that.

The overall system is designed by Tesla, but then there's components from a number of other suppliers.

We're not anticipating any significant downtime for S and X. It's just sort of like maybe it's 1 or 2 weeks out of the year, something like that.

And then we expect, through economies of scale and just general design improvements, to get another30% improvement. So that's where the 50% improvement comes relative to the S.
