Our energy business was impacted as well byshutdown activities in Q1, limiting deployments. We are taking the near-term actions required to continue thoseinvestments. Model Y remains on track to achieve our long-termplans and technology road map, and we will continue to invest in this area. We expect regulatory credit sales, which are credits we sell to other carmakers, to generally increase with time. This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.
