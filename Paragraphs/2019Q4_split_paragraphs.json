        "paragraph": "I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Directorof Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2019Q&A Webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of otherexecutives.Our Q4 results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published atthe same link as this webcast.During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. So Q4 was another strong quarter for the company. Deliveries reached over112,000 vehicles in a single quarter. It's hard to think of a similar product with such strong demandthat it can generate more than $20 billion in revenue with 0 advertising spend. I think that's -- wherewe do say that from time to time, I think it's often overlooked, but to have the highest-demandelectric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is, I think, quite remarkable and speaks tothe nature of the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate thatdemand without a bunch of advertising.At our Fremont factory, we're producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in itsrecord year of 2006. And obviously, we expect to exceed that significantly this year. This rate ofproduction was [cheap] before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont. So there's alot of potential to go beyond that number.For the Shanghai factory, I'd like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launchingModel 3 last quarter and achieving the first deliveries earlier this year. I'm really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory. I think it's going to be an incredible asset tothe company. And we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in Shanghai. So a lot of goodprogress there.Regarding Model Y , it was only 10 months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype."

        "paragraph": "And now inJanuary this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already. Now this is thanks to agreat effort from our engineering team. And we managed to achieve, by far, the highest energyefficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Yall-wheel drive got an EPA rating of 315 miles. This improvement is reflected on the configurator asof today. This is above what we've previously stated by a pretty significant margin. And then justwith great acceleration, top speed, it's really just incredible specs all around.For the Cybertruck, a few months ago, we revealed the -- obviously, remember, we revealed theCybertruck, that was -- that went viral. And we tried to build a product that -- a product that issuperior in every way without any preconceptions of how such a product should look. So it reallyjust -- from the standpoint of what's the most badass, futuristic, armored personnel carrier that kicksthe ass of any other pickup truck, basically that's the goal. And we wanted it to look like somethingthat just kind of came out of a sci-fi movie set from the future. And the demand has been incredible.We've never seen actually such a level of demand at this -- we've never seen anything like it,basically. I think we will make as -- about as many as we can sell for many years. So as many -- wewill sell as many as we can make. It's going to be pretty nuts. So -- and I think, actually, the productis better than people realize even. They don't even have enough information to realize just theawesomeness of it. It's just great.So -- and then stepping back in 2018, from a financial standpoint, we were -- free cash flow ratewas breakeven. But in 2019, we managed to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow whilebuilding a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y in production. SoI think for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacitywhile developing new products, while improving the core engineering, is a testament to the, I think,incredible performance of the Tesla team. And I'm just so proud to work with such a great team.I'd like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control."

        "paragraph": "That's what hasallowed us to get to these compelling financial numbers, while at the same time, growing companyat an incredible pace.And in conclusion, when I think of what we have in front of us in the next couple of years, we'vegot Model Y , we've got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck, some very excitingimprovements in battery technology, we've got Full Self-Driving, the next-gen Roadster andprobably a bunch of other products we'll come up with, too. It's hard to think of another companythat has more exciting product and technology road map.So super fired up about where Tesla will be in the next 10 years. If you look back 10 years fromtoday to 2010, we will produce approximately 1,000x more cars in 2020 than we produced in 2010.One thousand. And we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit and Powerwall, Powerpack, all thoseother things, too. So where will we be in 10 years? Very excited to consider the prospect.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, Elon. And Zach has some opening remarks as well.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. This past year was truly transformational for Tesla, and I want to thankeveryone who's been a part of making this happen.On 2019, a few key points I'd like to highlight. On demand, while we've mentioned this a fewtimes, it's worth highlighting once again. Over the course of the year, we've transitioned entirelyfrom generating Model 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.We've also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs, even increasing slightly in Q4. And we've seen anincrease in ASPs of S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.With respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch ofModel 3 in Fremont and Reno. As a result, we've been able to bring new production capacity onboard faster and with less cost. This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in Shanghai as well asModel Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched in under one year.Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled throughhigher volumes, improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management andcontinued improvement in our product and operational costs. And we are able to achieve positiveGAAP net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled strong cashgeneration."

        "paragraph": "We've also made progress on recurring software-based revenue with the implementationof premium connectivity and the beginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobileapp.Finally, on stock-based compensation, it increased sequentially by $82 million, driven almostentirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant. This is a result of our improvedexpected financial performance of the company, which the CEO stock grant is tied to.As we look ahead to 2020, this, again, will be an important year for the company. Our task ahead isto execute on the next phase of growth while managing cash flows to support that growth. OnModel Y , we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp oversubsequent quarters. As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Ycompared to the Model 3.This year, for the Shanghai-built Model 3, we expect to achieve run rate production and deliveryrates. In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of planned supply chain localization atthe factory or in the region. This is one of the most important components to achieve lowerproduction costs for the site. We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally built Model 3 andremain focused on continuing the production ramp and managing costs. We also anticipatesignificant progress on factory construction of Shanghai- and Berlin-built Model Y , which willresult in continued increases in capital spending.On operating expenses, I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growingproduct pipeline and international footprint. However, OpEx growth should increase at a lower ratethan top line revenue.Overall, we believe this will set us up for our strongest annual financial performance yet, withsufficient forecasted cash flows to support investments related to our growth and furtherstrengthening of our balance sheet.For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality. Additionally, weare in the process of ramping 2 major products, Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont,which I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins. We are also in the early stages ofunderstanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the coronavirus. At thispoint, we're expecting a 1- to 1.5-week delay in the ramp of Shanghai-built Model 3 due to agovernment-required factory shutdown."

    {
        "paragraph": "This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter but islimited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages.We are also closely monitoring whether there'll be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built inFremont. So far, we're not aware of anything material, but it's important to caveat that this is anevolving story. However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans whilefurther strengthening the balance sheet.Thank you, again, for your support, and we will turn to questions."

    {
        "paragraph": "Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. We are going to take the first questions from retail investors compiled by SayTechnologies.So the first retail investor question is, \"since solar is required for all new home constructions inCalifornia, do you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large Californiahomebuilders that you can share? What's the 2020 target for the number of Solarglass Roofinstallations in California?\"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I think we do -- we are seeing, mostly from a small base, exponential growth in demand andoutput for solar -- for the Solarglass Roof. So it's difficult to predict what the demand will be thisyear, except that the demand is very strong. And we are working also not just through Tesla SolarRoof but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whetherit's in North America, on the order of 4 million new roofs per year. So we see a lot of interest.And so it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do theinstallation. But over time, I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something touse Solarglass in one form or another. It's really going to be a choice of do you want a roof that isalive with power or dead without. And I think people will want a live roof that generates power andlooks good and lasts a long time, and it's the future we want.So it will be a significant product, but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product andthere's a lot of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome, and this will be a major productline of Tesla. And the Buffalo factory is doing great. So, yes.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. And the second question from retail shareholders is, \"will you release the Tesla ride-hailing network app before full autonomy and change the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow ownersto be drivers on the network? If so, when will this happen? Might want to target California airportsfirst. Also a good place to add Superchargers.\"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorSorry, it sounds like more question than one.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRYes, it's a bit of a bundle. Yes.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "- Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I think it's -- it probably will make sense to have the -- to enable car sharing in advance of thekind of sort of driving robotaxi fleet because the car sharing can be done before Full Self-Driving isapproved by regulators. So it's probably something that we would enable before the full sort ofrobotaxi fleet is enabled. And it sounds like there were some other questions bundled in there.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRSuperchargers at airports.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorSure. Yes. Yes, probably, we'll have Superchargers in airports. We'll have Superchargers whereverwe see that there is a need for Superchargers.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOAnd then on the insurance part of the question, it is our intent to allow people to put their cars intoride-sharing or the FSD network using Tesla Insurance. That's not currently the case, but by thetime that this is available, it's our intent to get that ready.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRYes, thank you. Next question from retail investors is, \"how many California owners are currentlyinsured with Tesla Insurance? What's the target for Tesla Insurance in 2020? When will you start tosignificantly leverage the data you have from the fleet to lower the cost of your coverage? Will weget premium discount of certain percent?\"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, go ahead, Zach.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. So Tesla Insurance is currently available in California. A couple of things that we're workingon, on this front. The first is to expand it to other locations. And we're preparing the regulatoryprocesses -- preparing our processes to go through the regulatory processes in those locations. We'realso working on the processes to continue to adjust our rates in California, which also have to gothrough regulatory processes as insurance is quite heavily regulated. And that's where we'respending our time focusing on Tesla Insurance right now. There's a significant amount ofinnovation, as we've discussed before in this space, exactly getting to the intent of what the questionhere is, using our technology to reduce rates. And this will be rolled in over time.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThe last part of the question was, will there be a discount for using Autopilot with our cars?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "- Founder, CEO & DirectorOh, yes. Yes. Yes, there will be.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOThe rate card for California, Tesla Insurance already considers the safety features associated withAutopilot.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorRight. But I think it would make sense for us to close loop on higher use of Autopilot for it reducesthe insurance cost as well as the probability of injury. So I think insurance is going to be, I think,quite a major product of Tesla over time. The amount of money that people spend on car insuranceis like a remarkably big percentage of the cost of a car. You can lease a Model 3 right now for $400a month, but a typical owner in California will be paying sort of between $100 and $200 a month ininsurance.So we're talking about something which is maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of the cost of the lease of the car isinsurance. And a lot of that insurance cost is just because the insurance companies don't have goodinformation about the drivers. And there's no good way to provide feedback, where it's a very poorfeedback mechanism in terms of the insurance rates versus the actual way that the car is beingdriven, whereas we can do that in real time. It's a fundamental information advantage that insurancecompanies don't have.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. The next question is, \"you set expectations that you would be feature-complete on FSDby the end of 2019. Can you please provide an update on when will we see this with end users?Where are you in retrofitting the FSD computer to older models?\"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I mean to be precise, I said I was hoping it would be feature-complete with most FSD by theend of last year. We got pretty close. It's looking like we might be feature-complete in a fewmonths. Feature-complete means just like it has some chance of going from your home to work,let's say, with no interventions. So that's -- it doesn't mean the features are working well, but itmeans it has above 0 chance. So I think that's looking like maybe it's going to be a couple of monthsfrom now.And -- but what isn't obvious regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving is just how much work hasbeen going into improving the foundational elements of autonomy."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "The core Autopilot software andAI team is just, I think, very, very strong and making great progress. And we're really onlybeginning to take full advantage of the Autopilot hardware, the FSD hardware. So I think it's -- theapparent progress, as seen by consumers, will seem to be extremely rapid. But actually, what'sreally going on, it seems like that is just having the foundational software be very strong, havereally strong foundation.And then a really fundamental thing is moving to video training. So in terms of labeling, labelingwith video and all 8 cameras simultaneously. This is a really -- I mean, in terms of labelingefficiency, arguably like a 3 order of magnitude improvement in labeling efficiency. For those whoknow about this, it's extremely fundamental. So that's really great progress on that.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. And the last retail investor question comes from Kendall. \"Since most retail investorsseem to understand Tesla better than analysts and are risking a larger part of their own personalwealth on Tesla, doesn't it make sense to take mostly questions on these earnings calls from us, viaSay? Do you even have to take questions -- answer questions from analysts?\"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I guess we don't have to. I do think that a lot of retail investors actually have a deeper andmore accurate insights than many of the big institutional investors and certainly a better insight thanmany of the analysts. It seems like if people really looked at some of the smart retail investors,analysts and -- what some of the smart -- smaller retail investors predicted about the future of Tesla,that would -- you'd probably get the highest accuracy and remarkable insight from some of thosepredictions.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. So now let's switch to institutional shareholder questions. The #1 question is, you havespoken previously about Shanghai Giga being 65% lower CapEx per unit of capacity. Have youlearned to do anything better or different from an OpEx perspective? And if yes, what kind ofimpact might we expect on the long-term gross margin?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorSure. Go ahead, Zach.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items ofCOGS for the Model 3 there."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "We have talked a lot about the CapEx per unit of capacity beinglower. But -- and you can basically run down an entire list of COGS between labor cost, materialcost due to localization. So it's opening up suppliers that would not have made economic sense fromthe States. Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs aswell. So we're not shipping cars from California over to China. And then that has a correspondingsavings on our lower import-related costs.And there's a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremontfacility here in California and also the Model 3 factory in China. And the simplification in terms ofthe flow is pretty evident from that layout, and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for theoperations of the facility.And so if you add all of this up, our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the costof Model 3 in China relative to Fremont. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that the costof the Standard Plus that we're selling out of Shanghai is also lower than that of the similar carcoming out of Fremont, from price perspective. And so -- and I've said this on previous earningscalls, I think it's fair to expect the margin coming out of the Shanghai facility to match the samemargin for the vehicle in Fremont.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think there's a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars,especially affordable cars than 3 and Y , at least on the continent where the customers are. It kind ofmakes sense. But what we're doing -- or have been doing in the past was really pretty silly, makingcars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe. And thiscreated a lot of cost because you've got to ship those cars. So you've got a lot of finished goodssitting on order or waiting at the port or going through customs. You got tariffs, transport.And then the factory complexity in California is very high because you've got different regulatoryrequirements in China, North America and Europe. So there are 3 different types of cars that arebeing built. It's very complex."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "And just having a factory in China or a factory in California or afactory in North America and a factory in Europe, just that alone, is a massive improvement in ourfundamental operating efficiency. That, I think, is -- may not be fully appreciated.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOAnd also on working capital.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOOr reducing OpEx here, too, [to ultimately change].Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The next question from institutional investors is, \"given the recent run in the share price, whynot raise capital now and substantially accelerate the growth in production, i.e., build theGigafactories, investment in Supercharger and customer service?\"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we're actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly. So if there's anysensible way to spend money, we are spending it. There is no artificial holdback on expenditures.Anything that I see that is -- looks like it's got good value for money, the answer is yes,immediately. So we're spending money, I think, efficiently and we're not artificially limiting ourprogress. And then despite all that, we are still generating positive cash. So in light of that, it doesn'tmake sense to raise money because we expect to generate cash despite this growth level.Zach, I don't know if you want to...Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFONo. I completely agree with that. I think some of our learnings during the Model 3 launch periodwere we grew too quickly and with too much complexity, and it held back our ability to continue toscale. And part of the journey that we've been on in 2019 is to unwind a series of unintentional badprocesses that kind of accumulated in the company over time. And so that's kind of whatcontributes to the reduction in OpEx over the year as we get smarter about that.And now we've laid a good foundation, I think. And I agree with you on that, we're not holdingback on the growth. I mean we have 2 products -- 2 vehicle products launching right now. And thatwill consume much of the bandwidth of the company to stabilize those over the course of the year.And then looking into next year, we have even more products launching, more factories."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "And so wewant to be smart about how we spend money and grow in a way that's sustainable, so we don't fallvictim to the mistakes, I think, we made 1.5 years or so ago.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The next question we've already answered regarding Autopilot time lines. So the followingquestion would be, \"can we please talk about cost control and OpEx sustainability in terms ofgrowth versus gross profit growth? How did we achieve the recent OpEx trends? And how shouldwe think about OpEx needs as we grow both vehicles and geographic workloads?\"Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. I commented briefly on this in my opening remarks. We did see an increase in operatingexpenses from Q3 to Q4, even excluding the portion of that attributed to stock-based compensation.And when you double click into that growth, it's supporting the Model Y program and alsoShanghai program as well.And so I think we, as a company, are now at the point where we've learned a lot on cost efficiency,as I've just mentioned. And we've unwound a number of the processes that were not in the rightplace, including automating with things that need to be automated. And we'll continue on thatjourney. But I think we're at a point now where OpEx will start to tick up, at least if you lookannually from 2019 to 2020, to support our international footprint and then the growth of thecompany. Our job is to grow that significantly slower than the pace of growth of revenue to improvethe operating leverage, which we're very, very focused on.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. And the last question from investors is, \"the sales of model S and X have stayed flat forseveral quarters. The main reason is that they still use 18650 batteries. When will S and X use 2170batteries? Manufacturing capacity of 18650 may be used for battery storage systems instead.\"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorSure. Well, actually, the core chemistry inside the 18650 cell has improved many times over theyears. So it's really just a form factor as opposed to a core technology. So it's -- I think we're prettyhappy with where the -- with the energy content of the cell and the improvements in efficiency ofthe vehicle."

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - CTONo. Other than to say that the 18650 lines have been running smoothly for a really long time in aworld where cell supply is fueling growth like we're part of the fuel of growth. I don't see a reasonto turn that cell supply off.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And actually, the Model S and X actually have more range than we are just currently stating onthe website. We just haven't gotten around to updating, the, I guess, the EPA certified number.

        "paragraph": "Our first question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDI actually agree. I think the retail questions were excellent, actually. So Elon, do you see potentialfor Tesla vehicles to be fitted with user terminals that are compatible with the Starlink constellationin the near- or medium-term future?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it's certainly something that could be happening in the coming years. There's no plans for itthis year. The focus of Starlink is really for high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity for homesand businesses, and I guess, aircraft and boats and that kind of thing. But the antenna for that high-bandwidth, low-latency thing is sort of about the size of medium pizza, which you could put on acar, but I think it's more bandwidth than you would really need. Technically, you could buy one andjust stick it on the car. Yes, it will work. Space range.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDAnd maybe just as a follow-up for my follow-up. How would -- assuming that we get the antennaform factor and cost down to a point where that could be integrated to the roof of a car, for example,cost effectively and aerodynamically, et cetera, how would compatibility with the Starlinkarchitecture theoretically improve the Tesla customer experience or the capability of the network?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I think it actually most possible that we'll just use the cellular connectivity, just use 5G. Itwould be the recommendation, certainly, in like any cities or something like that. But if you're outin the countryside and there's not good cell connectivity, then maybe you could connect with aStarlink antenna. And you don't need to like have like gigabit level or level of connectivity. You can-- probably like 20, 30 megabits is probably fine. And you can have much lower antenna.So yes, I guess it could be good for making sure there's connectivity and -- outside of major citiesand that kind of thing. But I mean that's -- yes, I'm sort of, I'd say, relatively obtuse. It's not -- we'renot thinking about it very much, to be honest."

And kind of asI look to model out the business long term, is there a rule of thumb that we can use for capitalexpenditures per unit of production capacity or some sort of rule of thumb like that?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI don't know if we wanted to tell you -- I don't think we want to say what our CapEx is going to bethis year, necessarily. We -- except to say that like as I said earlier, we're spending money as fast aswe can spend money in sensible ways. So it's definitely not artificially limited, and we will spend --well, a lot of money is here, for sure. The challenge comes in like finding efficient ways to actuallydeploy the capital. That's the harder part than sort of deciding on a CapEx number really.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. We...Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsAnd I think we always find ways to become more CapEx efficient per unit of capacity.

I mean is that something that's feasible for you guys to execute on, on aconsistent basis, a level of capacity building that large?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOI mean, I think...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWe're heading for more than 30%, yes.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, I think the math -- I'm not sure of the math that you've done, but I think our internal plans arefaster. And just back on your first question, we will have additional detail on CapEx in the 10-K.But back to the growth rate, I mean, one thing to keep in mind is that the Shanghai facility, we dohave a loan facility in place to support that growth. So that helps. And then as our productionvolumes increase, that generates more cash flow in the business as well that allows us to continue tofund additional factory. So I wouldn't necessarily view it as limited as you described it.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think a few years ago, I said I -- yes, I think -- I don't know when it was, but a few years ago,I said my estimate for us is that Tesla would grow at an average compound annual rate -- averagerate of in excess of 50%. I still hold that belief."

        "paragraph": "Our next question from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures.Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-Founder & Head ofResearchCongratulations on the progress. First question related to Cybertruck. You mentioned you'll sell asmany as you can make. Can you remind me how many you think you can make? And any thoughtson the cost of production for making those Cybertrucks?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we don't comment on those detailed numbers, except the demand is just far more than wecould reasonably make in the space of, I don't know, 3 or 4 years or something like that. So thething we're going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that'svery fundamental because if you don't improve battery production capacity, then you end up justshifting unit volume from one product to another, and you haven't actually produced more electricvehicles.So that's part of the reason why we have not, for example, really accelerated production of the TeslaSemi because it does use a lot of cells. And unless we've got a lot of battery cells available, then saylike accelerated production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making fewer Model 3or Model Y cars. So we've got to really make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery productionand continue to improve the cost per kilowatt hour of the batteries. This is very fundamental andextremely difficult.So I said we're going to do like kind of Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this and whatour plans are. I think probably it's going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarterbecause I think it's going to be kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter. So tentatively,sort of in the April time frame, we'll do a Battery Day and kind of go through what the challengesare, how do you get from here to, I don't know, a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year orsomething.Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-Founder & Head ofResearchGreat. I look forward to that Battery Day. You also mentioned in your prepared comments aboutother products that may come up, and the only vehicle not announced for master plan part 2 is ahigh passenger density vehicle. Any light that you can give us regarding that project?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc."

        "paragraph": "- Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Going back to what I just said, the -- we've got to improve the total battery capacity.Otherwise, we add complexity, but we do not improve the number of vehicles on the road. So whilewe do some sort of high-capacity vehicle at some point probably, but we need to make sure we gotthe batteries to make cars that we've already got already on our plate. And it's just generally true.And I've seen some, I think, sort of sensible comments by ARK Invest where they're pointing outthat really people do prefer to drive in their cars mostly by themselves. And like the average -- Imean the average number of occupants in a car, I think, is like 1.2. And maybe with autonomy,maybe they'll go to 1.4, maybe. But I'm not sure if it even goes there.So yes, will it make sense for us to do sort of a minivan or sort of Sprinter-like van at some point?Probably. But like I said, we've got to solve this battery -- we've got to scale battery production tocrazy levels that people cannot even fathom today. That's the real problem."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from [John Sager] with Evercore ISI.Unidentified Analyst -I want to talk about the differences between the Model 3 and the Model Y beyond the sort of 10%rule of thumb just around cargo and size. Are there other features that are going to differentiate the2 models? And then as a follow-on to that, you've talked in the past about how Model S sales grewwith the introduction of Model X. So are you planning on setting up your production facilities toalign with that thesis that essentially Model 3 sales will expand alongside the introduction of ModelY?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWe're not quite sure what's going to happen, but it is true that Model X -- the introduction of ModelX actually increased Model S sales because people would come in and look at the Model X andthey like said, \"okay, I prefer the sedan.\" And we're worried that X sales would cause S sales todrop but it actually caused it to increase. So from -- like I said, we're not too worried about demand.We're worried about production, make sure we get that production ramp going and reach volumeproduction as soon as possible with Model Y .And it's hard to -- it's always hard to predict what that S -- the exponential part of the S-curve ofproduction. Our production pretty much always follows this S-curve, or it's kind of like a herkyjerky S-curve. And you can -- it's easy to predict what it's going to be like in beginning because it'slow, and it's easy to predict what it's going to be like at the end, but that intermediate portion of theS-curve is very difficult to predict. So that's -- and it involves a massive amount of hard work andjust reacting fast to issues that arise.So yes, I think we'll just go as fast as we can with Model Y and make sure it's a great product. Ithink there are some things that will differentiate it but not -- it's not something we want to talkabout on this call. And I think when they do -- when people do a teardown of the Model Y , I thinkthey'll be impressed about some of the things they see.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOAnd just to add to that, I think it's important to keep the Model Y launch in context of the next 18 to24 months."

Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior AnalystCan you speak to the pricing strategy in light of the China price reductions as well as the mission toincrease EV adoption? Is there a target for gross profit or operating profit on a per vehicle basis thatwe should be thinking about? Or how should we really frame that for ourselves?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean we were trying to make the cars as affordable as possible and as fast as possible whilemaintaining reasonable -- while still being at least a little bit profitable and grow the company likecrazy and having good free cash flow and accumulating our cash balance.Zach, anything you want to add?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFONo, I think that's fair. Our order rate supports the pricing that we have right now. We're workingvery hard to reduce costs and expand production because, I mean, we feel from the data, it's prettyclear that there's a lot of interest in our products. And so what we're working on is to increaseproduction, increase availability of the products with time. And the price reduction in China, kindof the first step towards this global localization, more accessible price. And we'll continue to workon cost reductions in China as we do in Fremont and grow production.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean the thing that's really going to, I think, probably just have a profound effect on ourfinancials is like -- is high volume and high margin, obviously. And that high margin part comesfrom autonomy. So do people buy the Full Self-Driving package or not and do they buy itworldwide or only in certain places? For example, our autonomy is not as good in China as it is inthe U.S. So fewer people -- a very small percentage of people buy the FSD package in China.But as we fix that, then we will see a much higher people -- percentage of people buying. And as weare close to Full Self-Driving, that's just going to become more and more compelling. So that's --from a financial standpoint, that's the real mind-blowing situation, is high volume, high marginbecause of autonomy.Colin William Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co.

Separate from the battery pack, since we'll talk about that in a couple of months, canyou speak to the areas of focus on powertrain technology-driven cost reduction over the next 12 to24 months that we should be thinking about?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, our powertrain is pretty damn good. I mean it's way better than anything else out there by acountry mile. It's worth noting, for example, that the Model S has like a 100 kilowatt hour pack, butTaycan has 100 -- like 95 kilowatt hour pack. The Model S is steadily approaching 400 miles range,but Taycan has 200 miles range. So we must be using that energy pretty efficiently and thepowertrain is a big part of that.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOI would just say the focus is on cost on the powertrain. When we're thinking about technologyinnovations, it's how do we how do we continue to drive the cost down. And that's through --voltage is maybe one angle, but there are certainly others that just enable more power density andlower cost.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorPowertrain is like mind-blowing, I think. Yes. Coming out later this year, end of the year, probably.It's our goal.

Can you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes, how you see sort of like thatmetric evolves? Obviously, you have the Model Y , which probably would have initial higherpricing, and then the China Model 3 is at a lower price. So I guess what are the puts and takes forwhat you see as sort of like stable ASP in 2020?Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsI think the product is better and better. That will increase the value.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. We don't want to really comment on prices and such. I think we'll adjust according to what thedemand looks like. I mean, like right now, it's pretty good. Maybe that will change. Who knows?Yes.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOBut I think the way you described it is fair. So I mean relative to the current Model 3, China Model3 pricing is slightly lower. And our Model Y pricing is public on the website, so you can see that it'sclearly slightly higher than the Model 3 that's out of Fremont. How the mix of those 3 products, andthat's out over the course of the year, we'll see. But I think it's probably fair at the moment toassume the mix of those is fairly stable in terms of ASP when you average them together.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean the affordability of our car in China improved radically because of very -- tariffs mostlygone away, purchase tax exemption, local product supply, not having to spend a bunch of money totransport it over the ocean.

So that's -- if you add to that Model S and Model Xand then the energy storage business, it means you've been following north of 60 gigawatt hour ofbattery production capacity. So where do you stand now? And how do you get there? And then itlooks like your competitors, others who would like to compete with you, seem to be struggling togrow battery capacity. So if you can just take us through what you're doing differently, why you'reconfident you can do that and it looks like nobody has done.Elon R.

And it's like now it turns out, actually, even the pros have trouble with it. It's pretty hard.But the fact is, we've already demonstrated massive growth in cell production capacity at ourGigafactory in Nevada. And you have to go from the cells to the modules to the pack.
