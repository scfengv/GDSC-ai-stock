        "paragraph": "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Tesla Inc. Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsQ&A Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Senior Director ofInvestor Relations, Mr. Martin Viecha. Please go ahead, sir.Martin ViechaThank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2017 Q&A Webcast.I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and Doug Field is on the line.Our 4Q results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter we published at thesame link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-lookingstatements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events orresults could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in ourmost recent filings with the SEC. Before we jump to Q&A, Elon would like to have some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight, thank you. So 2017 was also a big year for Tesla. We launched the Model 3, which was our firstmass production vehicle, and it's a huge step change for Tesla. A lot of challenges but I think we madetremendous progress on that front.We also designed and installed and got into operation the world's largest battery in Australia, the largestbattery by a significant margin. And that battery is exceeding its performance targets significantly. We alsounveiled the Tesla Semi, which is a super heavy-duty truck, maximum load semi truck, and the next-genRoadster, which we believe will exceed gasoline sports cars on every dimension.And we also achieved record production and deliveries of Model S and X. And overall, I think, whilethere were challenges associated with Model 3 ramp at the -- we were in a deeper level of hell than weexpected. So a few levels deeper than we'd like to be but swiftly exiting, I think. And so it's really, Ithink, on balance, a phenomenal year. And I'd like to thank everyone at Tesla, who should be very proudof the work they've done. This is incredibly difficult. I'd like to thank everyone for their hard work andcontribution to 2017 being a really good year for Tesla.I also want to thank our suppliers, particularly those involved in Model 3, as they've shared the verticalstruggle we've had in ramping our production, and they've really burned the midnight oil, spent weekendsand taking a lot of risks and suffered alongside us in the challenges associated with the ramp."

        "paragraph": "So I'd liketo thank them for supporting us through this difficult time with Model 3.As well, our customers and Model 3 reservation holders, you're going to love your cars, and we areworking to get them to you as quickly as we possibly can. As for Model 3 production, we continue to makesignificant progress every day, and we are targeting a weekly production rate of 2,500 vehicles by the endof March and 5,000 by the end of Q2.And as what's been -- or you've seen in the letter, the quarter-over-quarter production of Model 3 is risingexponentially. So I hope we'll -- that people think that if we can send a Roadster to the asteroid belt, wecan probably solve Model 3 production. It's just a matter of time. So -- and really the error bars on thetiming are really quite small in the grand scheme of things.So it's -- 2018 is likely to be a very big year for us. At some point in 2018, we expect to begin generatingpositive quarterly operating income on a sustained basis, operating 5,000 a week of Model 3 production.And I am cautiously optimistic that we will be GAAP profitable. It's not certain, but it's -- I'm cautiouslyoptimistic that we will actually be GAAP profitable with no asterisk.Martin ViechaThank you, Elon. Andrew, let's go to the first question."

        "paragraph": "I'm showing we have a question from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionCongratulations on the launch yesterday. Wanted to just ask a couple of questions. One is just to get alittle bit more color from you on Model 3, what the production run rate is at the moment. Maybe if you canjust provide us with a little bit more color on where the challenges are at this point? On the last call, youtalked about, I think, 2 of the 4 zones at Gigafactory that were still kind of an issue in manual operation.Have those been resolved? And once you get to 2,500, is the ramp to 5,000 -- does that just merelyinvolve increasing line speeds?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSure. I'll try to give as much color as possible. I am reminded of -- I think it may have been Churchill'sline about sausage. If you like sausage and respect the law, you should watch neither being made. Andjust to me, that is true of a production ramp. So I wouldn't read too much into the day-to-day battles ofthis or that, but I'll give you the color, but don't like -- don't read too much into it. So yes, there are 4zones in module production. Module production is fundamentally the limiting factor on Model 3 output,which is ironic since battery modules really should be the thing we're best at. And I think in part, wewere probably a little overconfident, a little complacent in thinking about this is something we know andunderstand and put a lot of attention on other things, not -- and just got too comfortable with our abilityto do battery modules because we've been doing that since the start of the company. And of the 4 zones,2 of them, which is subcontracted to -- the production system is subcontracted to other companies, flatout, didn't work, it turns out. Like I mean, we were promised they would work, and it just didn't work. Sowe had to do what would normally be maybe an 18-month development cycle for a production system ofthat scale and complexity and tried to do that in basically 6 months, maybe a little -- 6 to 9 months. Andwe've tackled that on multiple levels, so we have a design that is nearing completion for a new automatedsystem for zone 1 and 2. That is being led by a Tesla ground team."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "It's an excellent design. All the otherwork that they've done has been -- has performed to spec. And we expect a single Tesla ground lineto be equivalent to 3, if not 4, of the current lines that we have and be smaller, which is, for me, kindof amazing. And then we have what we call a semiautomatic line, which is a series of small automatedstations manned by people. And they've actually been remarkably effective. It has sort of renewed myfaith in humanity that the rapid evolution of progress and the ability of people to adapt rapidly has -- isquite remarkable. Our semiautomatic -- our sort of semi-manual, semiautomatic line is exceeding all 3 ofthe automatic lines right now. So -- and that is something that we're able to scale quite rapidly. I mean,J.B., is there additional color you'd like to add on that?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerSure, that's a great summary of it. I think much has been made about the manual production of modules.That's really not very accurate. These are, as Elon said, semiauto lines where we have people theremoving materials perhaps between the machines that are actually performing the operations. But there isstill a degree of automation doing the operation.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight. It's not artisanal.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerExactly. And this is what has been ramping quite effectively in the last -- in the first half -- the first part ofthis year. So we're continuing to expand that, the semiauto lines, and that is effectively bridging the gapas we redesign the full automation and bring that online.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. And it's pretty -- it's a small thing. So actually, I think it's probably worth providing some tours forinvestors that are interested, so you can actually see it first-hand. I think a lot of it is like if you see itfirst-hand, you will understand exactly what's going on. And so I think let's arrange for some new toursfor investors that are interested because I think you can really get a feel for what it is. Otherwise, it's justsome words that are kind of hard to put -- hard to imagine.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerI also just want to add, I think it's fair to say that this maybe degree of complacency that happened at theend of last year has been pretty thoroughly replaced by an intense focus from a huge portion of the Teslateam."

    {
        "paragraph": "And there are a lot of different initiatives and teams, whole teams, targeted at this area. So as Elonopened with, it's not a question of if we will get to the production rate, it's just a question of the matter oftime.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, absolutely.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionIf I could just clarify, what's the run rate now with semiautomation? And when are you expecting the fullyautomated line to come on?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, it's probably a level of granularity that is not productive to dive into in terms of exactly what iscoming from which operation. But we do expect the new automated lines to be landing and starting out atthe Gigafactory in just the next -- well, the landing in sight within this quarter.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, expect the new automated lines to arrive next month, in March. And then it's already -- it's been-- it's working in Germany so that's going to tracked -- going to be disassembled, brought out to theGigafactory and reassembled and then go into operation at the Gigafactory. It's not of question whetherit works or not. It's just a question of disassembly, transport and reassembly. So that's kind of -- yes. Sowe expect to alleviate that constraint. That -- with alleviating that constraint, that's what gets us to theroughly 2,000 to 2,500 unit per week production rate. The next constraint would be material conveyanceat our Fremont vehicle plant. And that's a very sophisticated automated parts conveyance system. Wethink it's probably the most sophisticated in the world or at least we're not aware of one that is more so.And the software for that is quite complex. So that would be the next constraint on production to get to5,000, is the conveyance system in Fremont. So that also appears to be on track. So we feel like the errorbars around the unit volume predictions are getting smaller with each passing week."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionI also want to add my congrats for the launch yesterday. The twin Falcon landing was probably thesickest thing I've ever seen in my life. First question is for Deepak. Deepak, a question for you. Giventhe negative trade cycle, your negative working cap, some of the modeling analysts are doing kind ofsimulating when you get to 2,500 or 5,000 or maybe somewhere in between that, that some of thearrangements you made with your suppliers who have been very helpful, that you might temporarily runenough negative working cap to even have operating cash flow exceed CapEx. Is that something that'spossible? Or again, I know there's execution behind that clearly, but is that something out of the questionor barely even?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerI think we got to look at it from a full quarter perspective. The negative working cycle is amplified by therate at which we ramp our production. Given our present plans of getting to 5,000 by end of Q2, it's afairly gradual -- it's exponential from where we started, but it's not going to create a situation where ourcash flow from operations will exceed CapEx.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionAnd just as a follow-up, Elon, your kind of compensation -- long-term compensation plan obviously gota lot of attention and raised some questions, however long term from now, on succession. Just want toask, do you see your successor as CEO of Tesla someone currently within the company right now or fromoutside the company? Kind of how do you see that?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI mean, there's no actual search going on or there's not even -- or passive -- active or passive searchgoing on for a new CEO because I expect to remain CEO for the foreseeable future. But at some point,if there's somebody really spectacular inside or outside the company who could take on that role andwho'd want to have that title and that role, that would be fine with me. And I would focus on productdevelopment, which is designing and engineering, which is what I like doing best. So -- but there are noplans to make change at the time."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Frank with Baird.Tyler Charles FrankRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionI guess, Elon, bigger picture and looking out a few years, you had mentioned a couple of quarters ago thatthe 1 million car target for 2020 was still there and that you would need to introduce the Model Y by then.How do we connect from where we are today to getting to 1 million units a year? And what should we lookfor this year in terms of ramping production or building a facility for the Model Y?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWe are going to make some capital investments towards the end of this year related to Model Y. I don'texactly count on those, but I think we've got a good plan. I'm pretty excited about the -- how we'redesigning Model Y. It's really taking a lot of lessons learned from Model 3 and saying how do we designthis thing to be easier to manufacture instead of how to manufacture, more difficult really. So I think it'sgoing to be -- I really think it's going to be pretty great and pretty scalable for Model Y. But we are goingto, as you suspect, need to make some capital investments in the second half of this year, really late,late Q3, Q4 for Model Y. And -- but I think we want to wait until -- wait probably 3 to 6 months beforeannouncing any further plans on production location and the details associated with that.Tyler Charles FrankRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionIs that 1 million unit target still in play?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes.Tyler Charles FrankRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionPerfect. And then just one quick follow-up. How should we think about the Tesla Semi and investmentsneeded there? And what are you guys thinking you can hit from an annual run rate in the next, let's say, 2to 4 years?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, a great difference between 2 and 4 years. Tesla -- I've said I think a few years ago, I think Teslais going to kind of grow at an average of roughly 50% a year, which is a crazy average growth rate for acompany manufacturing complex products at scale. So 2 versus 4 is a huge difference. But if you say like-- and it's much easier to predict, especially, this production, because they look like an S curve, whereyou have an initial exponential, which -- the exponential appears -- it seems people naturally tends toextrapolate on a straight-line basis."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "An exponential always appears -- the predictions are conservativein the beginning, and then the exponential takes off, and then it becomes linear, and then it becomeslogarithmic. So it's easier to predict -- far easier to predict the endpoint or the steady state of the S-curvethan anywhere on that exponential -- or log curve. So if you say 4 years, I think 100,000 units a year is areasonable expectation. Maybe more but that's the right -- roughly the right number, I think.Tyler Charles FrankRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionFor the Tesla Semi?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I think we might be able to exceed the specs that we unveiled last year too, which is pretty exciting.I know there's, like, speculation that we might not meet them, but I think we're going to exceed them.So -- and I made this comment before. It's like -- feels like I gloss over these comments, but I reallytake these to heart. The competitive strength of Tesla long term is not going to be the car. It's going tobe the factory. We're going to productize the factory. And really this is the lesson that is kind of obviousin history because the Model T wasn't a product. It was River Rouge. The Model T is a very simple car.Anybody could have made that car, but not anyone could make River Rouge. And that's really what wouldbe Tesla's long-term competitive advantage. We'll have a great lineup of great products, great design,great engineering the product itself in the vehicles and autonomy and all that sort of stuff. But the factoryis going to be the product that has the long-term sustained competitive advantage, in my opinion."

    {
        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionElon, on your autonomous vehicle strategy, why do you believe that your current hardware set of onlycamera plus radar is going to be able to get you to fully validated autonomous vehicle system? Most everycompetitor noted that they need the redundancy from LIDAR hardware given the robustness of the 3Dpoint cloud and the data it's generated. What are they missing in their software stack and their algorithmsthat Tesla's able to obtain from just a camera plus radar? Further, what would be your response if theregulatory bodies require that level of redundancy and that's really needed from an incremental LIDARhardware?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Well, first of all, I should say there's actually a 3-sensor systems test. There are cameras, redundantforward cameras. There are -- there's the forward radar, and there's -- there are the ultrasonics for nearfield. So a third is also -- a third set is also important for near field stuff just as it is for humans. But Ithink it's pretty obvious that the road system is geared towards passive optical. We have to solve passiveoptical image recognition extremely well in order to be able to drive in any given environment and achanging environment. We must solve passive optical image recognition. We must solve it extremelywell. At the point at which we have solved it extremely well, what is the point in having active optical,meaning LIDAR, which does not -- which cannot read signs? It's just giving you -- in my view, it is acrutch that will drive companies to a local maximum, that we'll find very difficult to get out of. If you takethe hard path of a sophisticated neural net that's capable of advanced image recognition, then I thinkyou'll achieve the goal maximum. And we combine that with increasingly sophisticated radar, and if you'regoing to pick active photon generator, doing so in 400 to 700-nanometer wavelength is pretty silly sinceyou're getting that passively. You would want your active photon generation in the radar frequencies ofapproximately around 4 millimeters because that is occlusion penetrating. And you can essentially seethrough snow or rain, dust, fog, anything. So it's just -- I find it quite puzzling that companies wouldchoose to do an active photon system in the wrong wavelength. They're going to get a whole bunch ofexpensive equipment, most of which makes the car sort of expensive, ugly and unnecessary, and I thinkthey will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage."

    {
        "paragraph": "Now perhaps I am wrong, in which case I'll looklike a fool. But I am quite certain that I'm not.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay. And as a follow-up, if I may, can we talk about the trajectory for the Model S and X margins? 3Q'17, I think the company was saying you're in the low 20% range. I think you took another step down perthe report today, so I'm assuming it's probably at 20%. What's the path to recovery from here? And canyou frame us through how you're going to get to that margin expansion?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerWe feel very good about the recovery of S and X gross margin to -- in 2018 to a level which we have seenin the past. And it's a combination of a variety of things. It's increasing the mix of the larger batteries, thehigher option content. And then also we have a very good and a robust manufacturing cost reduction roadmap. We will achieve a lot of manufacturing efficiencies which continue to occur on S and X, so we feelreally good about it.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I mean, we -- our internal plan, whether we meet this or not, I don't know. But I think we will. Ourinternal plan calls for turnaround of 30% to 32% cash gross margin on S and X by the end of the year andprobably 25%, maybe 26% GAAP gross margin on S and X towards the end of this year. And then Model3, maybe not by the end of this year but not far behind it.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerRight. And just as Elon said, internal road map and internal plans, things sometimes get delayed, theydon't work out exactly. But I think you get a sense that we feel really good about the improvement that'sahead.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, we have a clear path to that goal."

Ltd., Research DivisionIt sounds like from the letter that you could do more than 100k S and X in '18 but you're constrained bythe 18650s. And I'm just curious, what would it take to see the 2170 cells in these vehicles?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, this is J.B. It's something we've, of course, contemplated, but it's quite a large change to thearchitecture of the module and the battery pack overall. And while the 18650 supply is somewhat of acap at about 100k units per year, even just a few months ago, we didn't feel that expanding and makingsome long-term bets on expanding that supply with Panasonic in Japan was really the right risk. It'ssomething we could consider, but right now, we're pretty happy with that balance, and it matches ourother production capabilities and our other investments.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, it's also like -- for any given complex manufactured item, in order to go past the target capacity,you really need to move the whole supply chain in cadence. So you really have to then shift everythingto say, okay, if you want to make 20% more S and X, everyone has to make 20% more, there have tobe investments in new lines or it's going to require overtime, which negatively affects gross margins.We [ didn't ] design the manufacturing machine for it [ to break ], and then you'd have to redesign themachine or go redline. And so I think we feel pretty good about the 100k a year for S and X, and we wantto focus on just improving the efficiency of production and the gross margin of the group.Romit Jitendra ShahNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research DivisionOkay. Yes, makes sense...Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology Officer[ Keeping, of course, ] the Model 3. I mean, that's really where the majority of the effort is.Romit Jitendra ShahNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research DivisionOkay. The other thing you guys mentioned was upcoming autonomous coast-to-coast drive, which we'rereally looking forward to. Could you give a little bit more color on time frame, when something like thatwould be available for customers?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. So we actually -- I've been meaning to address this but -- because obviously, I missed the mark onthat front. Our focus is very much on Model 3 production, so everything else kind of took a second placeto that."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "But the -- we could have done the coast-to-coast drive, but it would have required too muchspecialized code to effectively game it or make it somewhat brittle in that it would work for one particularroute but not be a general solution. So [ although ] you would be able to repeat it, but just not any otherroute, which is not really a true solution. I am pretty excited about how much progress we're makingon the neural net front. And it's a little -- it's also one of the things that's kind of exponential, where theprogress doesn't seem like -- it doesn't seem like much progress, it doesn't seem like much progress,then suddenly, wow. That's been my observation generally with AI stuff. And you look at, say, somethinglike what people at DeepMind did with AlphaGo. It went from not being able to beat even a pretty goodGo player to something that could beat the European champion, then it could beat the world champion,then it could thrash the world champion, then it could thrash everyone simultaneously. Then they madeAlphaZero, which could thrash AlphaGo, where it's just winning against itself, was better than all theworld's human experts. It's kind of going to be like that for self-driving. It will seem like, well, this is alame driver, lame driver, like, okay, that's a pretty good driver, like, holy cow, that driver is good. It will belike that. I mean, timing-wise, I think we can probably do a coast-to-coast drive in 3 months, 6 months atthe upside.Romit Jitendra ShahNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research DivisionAnd then is it available for customers immediately? Or is there a lag?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, that would be something that's available for customers. [ We currently have done it, do tests on it ]."

BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionAs you put solutions in place one by one to unclog Model 3 production bottlenecks in Fremont or atthe battery module line in Reno, are you finding that the ultimate solution is more or less expensive toimplement than your original plans, which called for a 25% gross margin on the vehicle? Do you feel anydifferently now about the cost to manufacture the Model 3 or its gross margin potential versus prior to thestart of production last July?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI think we feel good about that. I think we're probably able to exceed that next year, probably. Like,our understanding of manufacturing has improved dramatically. We can think of a huge number ofways to make it far better, far more efficient. I'm really excited about how much we're learning aboutmanufacturing. That's why I said I think the long-term strength of Tesla will be the manufacturing plant,essentially productizing the Gigafactory, which is like the world's biggest product basically, like, make anuclear aircraft carrier look pretty small by comparison.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. Maybe just to add to that, I mean, the products bill of materials cost and the embedded labor cost is-- I think, that's where there's opportunities. And we are simplifying and we're finding ways to improve thedesign incrementally as we go through the ramp. If there is some small increases in CapEx, that doesn'tdirectly -- it will be overwhelmed by the improvements in simplicity and some cost savings in the productitself.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, I think the bottom line is we feel really optimistic about the long-term potential for gross margin onModel 3 and especially on Model Y.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. We haven't seen anything that particularly changes our view.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionThat's very helpful. And then just for -- yes, and then for my follow-up. I see the guidance in the letterabout the quarterly operating income turning positive at some point in 2018. That's great. I'm just curiouswhat your thoughts are with regard to when you also might generate free cash flow. Is that less of amedium-term focus as you prefer to invest operating cash flows from the Model 3 into the Semi truck,Roadster and Model Y?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. We could be positive cash flow, I think pretty significant positive cash flow probably in like thirdquarter, which is like 4, 5 months from now."

It makes good business case and business sense to invest.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Silver bullets for me, in fact, can't emphasize enough. And what I find sort of interesting is that ourcompetitors -- well, the car industry thinks they're really good at manufacturing. And they're actually-- they are quite good at manufacturing, but they just don't realize just how much potential there is forimprovement. It's way more than they think. I went through this math, I think, on a prior earnings call,but like it sounds like some of the -- the fastest car factories produce a car maybe every 25 seconds. Itsounds fast. But if you think about a 5-meter long car including gap, a 4.5-meter car with 0.5 meter gapor something, that's only 0.2 meters per second. Like grandma with a walker can beat the speed of thefastest production line on earth. So really not that fast. Walking speed is 1 meter per second, so 5x fasterthan the fastest production line on earth. Why? It should at least be jogging speed. I mean, in the limit,companies should start caring about the aero drag in the factory, which -- that's maybe around 20 or 30miles an hour or \"30 kilometers an hour, 40 kilometers an hour.\" It's like stuff should be moving at thatspeed."

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionYou commented in the shareholder letter that capital expenditures for 2018 were expected to be a bithigher than 2017. I'm wondering if you could tell us what exactly is in that, call it, roughly $3.5 billion. Areyou going to get to full like 10,000 car per week capacity? Is that in the $3.5 billion? What will Gigafactoryproduction be? And in the slightly more than $3.4 billion, is that also including the investments, Elon, thatyou mentioned on Model Y? So where exactly is this level of capital spending going to take us in 2018?And I have a follow-up, please.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerSure, I mean, our biggest -- at a very high-level sort of breakdown, our biggest investment is obviouslyin the Model 3. And that includes completion of the payments that we still have to make on the capacitywe are putting in place now as well as significant investment in -- or required upfront for the next phaseof Model 3 production to 10,000-plus per week. So that's, I would say, overall more than 50%, reallymore than 50% is Model 3. And the rest is all the many other things we talked about, whether it's energystorage, whether it's...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderPrimarily Y and energy storage.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerRight. And then our infrastructure spend, superchargers, stores, service centers. We want to significantlyincrease the service capacity, want to significantly increase our supercharging capacity. So all of thosepieces then add up to the total spend.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. The -- just to give you some sort of flavor for our optimism on Model Y, I think. Model Y, I think, wemight aim for something like maybe capacity of 1 million units a year, something like that, just for ModelY alone. And I think we'll be able to do that for CapEx that is less than the Model 3 CapEx at the $0.5million. So probably -- I think we can probably improve CapEx by a factor of 2. It's not a promise, butthat's my gut feel on Model Y CapEx, just to give you a flavor for my level of optimism on improvementson the manufacturing front.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionThat's helpful. And just so is the $3.5 billion and the greater than 50% to Model 3, is that going tocomplete all the required equipment to get us to 10,000 a week at the end of the year? Or are we stillgoing to have incremental capital expenditures? And then separately, on my second question aroundModel 3 gross margins, I think you had said that you expected them to be breakeven this quarter.Obviously, volume was lower, and so you didn't get there."

        "paragraph": "But for next quarter, you're suggesting thatthey're going to be negative again despite the fact that I think Q1 volumes are much higher than what youwould have anticipated originally for Q4 when you thought that margins would be breakeven. So can youhelp reconcile the apparent enthusiasm you have about the gross margin trajectory with the fact that yourguidance around gross margins in the near term actually appears more cautious than it was guided at thetime?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerCan you hear us?A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionYes, I can hear you.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, no worries. Yes, to sort of finish off your first part of the question, no, we will still have furtherinvestments in the 10,000 per week capacity of the Model 3 happening next year as all of that will beconcluded next year. There's always a lag in our cash outflow while we continue to test the equipmentand verify it. So that'll continue in '18 -- in '19. And then in terms of the Model 3 gross margins, ourexpectations earlier were of a much steeper ramp than what we are projecting here. We were targeting,as you well know at one point, hitting 5,000 by the end of '17. And now that's 6 months later. So -- butthat's slower ramp. We just know we'll have inefficiencies. We have the full capacity, so the depreciation ofall that equipment and the operating costs are hitting while we're not producing as many cars. It's actuallypretty simple. And it's only temporary. It doesn't imply anything fundamental.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, exactly. The problem is like when you've got a machine where most of that machine, I mean thatoverall production and supply chain machine, is at a 5,000-unit capacity but then 10% or 15% of it isn't,then you got this massive load on a small -- on a way smaller production volume. Then as that productionvolume -- as you fix that remaining 10% or 15% of the production machine, you're able to get to thattarget production, and then things improve dramatically. It's sort of like having a car that's operating ata fraction of its -- let's use a gas-themed analogy. We've got a 4-cylinder car operating on 1 cylinder. It'slike, okay, it's not so great, one full -- or suppose it is -- machines were -- it's just like a big machineessentially, yes."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Philippe Houchois with Jefferies.Philippe Jean HouchoisJefferies LLC, Research DivisionI have a slightly -- nonrelated to earnings about the electric truck, the Semi. In the past, Mr. Musk, youhave spoken about supercapacitors as a way of generating energy and/or storing energy. And particularlyin the application of heavy trucks, I would expect that the surge of energy in slowing down or braking inthe truck would be too much for a battery to absorb. Are you considering supercapacitors as an applicationfor the Semi? Or what is your kind of general thought on that technology, and the implications to makethat industrially viable?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I mean, ages ago, I was going through basically applied physics and computer science degree,a Ph.D. in capacitors. So I'm a big fan of capacitors. I just don't think -- I think that the lithium ionchemistry is so good at this point that capacitors will not be needed. There's a certain power-to-energyratio, and once you have a huge amount of energy, which is needed for range, then you automaticallyhave the power you need for absorbing -- for being able to do rapid acceleration and braking.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. It's maybe not intuitive, this is J.B., but the power-to-energy demand on the battery in the heavytruck is actually generally less than in our sort of performance vehicles. It's definitely less also, in mostcases, than even the high rate of discharge energy products. So as Elon said, you have a lot of energy, soyou end up with a lot of power, actually more than you need.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. And the way that chemistry works is that you're able to actually extract, for short periods of time,extract very high power from lithium ion cells as you sort of have ion migration right on the surface. Andthen the sustained power for lithium ion is conservatively less than the power over, say, the course ofseveral seconds or minute. But the several seconds power for lithium ion is remarkably good becauseyou're essentially using ion migration from the outer surface. It's like if you have a parking lot, all the carsin the front of the parking lot can just exit. But once you start getting cars from deep in the parking lot, ittakes a while for them to wind their way out."

I'd like to talk, follow-up a little bit on the first question around some of the manufacturing roadblocksas well as the comment about building a machine to build the machine, which I believe was the title of a1990 MIT book about Toyota. Could you maybe give us some more discussion really on the managerialculture, the process level, how you would benchmark yourself, for example, against the Toyota factory,which seems to be able to launch new product in about 3 or 4 months, to ramp up? Or at the otherextreme, because I know Mr. Field came from there, kind of what Foxconn does in its goal to replacehumans? But in particular, talk about the managerial processes, not so much the robots you're putting intoplace.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, I'm pretty sure Toyota cannot ramp up any of their products in 3 months. In fact, I'm 100% certainabout that. Deepak spent many years at Ford before joining Tesla.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes.

But within that then, what are the differences though in the way you're going to be managing thefactory?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThe most fundamental difference is thinking about the factory as -- really as a product, as a quitevertically integrated product.Jeffrey B.

MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes -- we don't think so.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerI think that generally, it's treated more as an optimized operational problem, being extremely lean andreally managing the flows of materials and the supply chain.

You still have a lot of workers. You still have a lot of people. I mean, just like with Model S, say, wehave a large service organization. There's scheduled maintenance. There are things that break. There arecrashes that need to be repaired. There are technology upgrades. But you don't actually ship people withthe Model S. That would be weird. That's not like hanging people in the car.

The degree with which we have productdevelopment and manufacturing development integrated is unique. And Model 3 already is a dramaticallysimpler car to build than the Model S. And even many people in operations who have worked their careerin volume manufacturers say the Model 3 is a huge step forward from anything that they've built.

It came from -- you have Apple and then Ford -- Ford and thenApple.John Douglas FieldSenior Vice President of EngineeringYes, the model at Foxconn was very different where very quick product ramps and very high scale wasachieved through manual processing of also what is fundamentally a product whose simplicity is orders ofmagnitude below ours. And iPad is less complicated than our center screen in many ways. So it's a verydifferent order of magnitude in terms of the kind of product you're building, and it's extremely manualbecause that is the way that you have to ramp very quickly and then end the life of our product and bringup a new one.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderActually, one thing we forgot mention is Jon McNeill, who is heading up our sales and service group, isdeparting the company.

Do you have enough experience with production of the Model 3 outside of the issuesyou're facing in the Gigafactory that you're confident once those problems are solved, you can get up andrunning? Or is there sort of a contingency here that once you get that worked out, you'll be ramping upin 3 months, and there might be some other hurdles that are discovered? I'm just trying to understand ifthere are some -- any incremental kinks that might come in the production process as you ramp up. Andthen also as we think about the step from 5,000 to 10,000, is that something that can be done inside theFremont factory? It sounds like you're confident that your density is much higher than what even Toyotaand GM were producing out there potentially on capacity. But just curious on those 2 [ things ].Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. There's really -- there are only 2 things that I'm aware of that are constraints in production ofany significance: the module being the most significant; and then the parts conveyance, basically, theautomated conveyance system that brings parts to the lines. The way the Fremont factory is set upis that there's actually, on the ground floor, we actually created 2 levels. The bottom level is all partsconveyance, so parts coming from the warehouse where the parts are sort of automatically sorted andthen are transferred through an automated conveyance system all the way to the line on the conveyancesystem being on the ground floor and then raised up to the line, which is actually on kind of an artificialmezzanine. And I think we can get 10,000 vehicles a week out of Fremont without a significant -- withoutcreating really any new buildings of significance in the existing space. We will need to bring up the southpaint shop, which is what we actually were using for S and X paint, and so we upgraded north paint todo S, X and 3. But with relatively small CapEx, way less than we spent on north paint, we're comfortablewe can bring south paint up to achieve the approximately 600,000 vehicles per year rate to combined100,000 S and X, 500,000 3, which would be 20% to 30% more than Toyota and GM produced in thesame facilities."

MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, [ exactly ].John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionJust as we think about that though, Elon, is that sort of an asymptotic limit in that plant? Or based onwhat you're really talking about, could you get more out of that plant? Or as we look at the Model Y andthere's million units capacity, we're definitively looking at a new facility?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI'm pretty excited about the Model Y stuff, and I think I want to present that in a more cohesive fashion.And it's probably not the next earnings call but call it 6 months from now. But I'm really excited about theModel Y manufacturing and the design manufacturing. Like essentially, how do we design out all the painthat we're currently going through? We do not want to experience it again. It's just really a lot of pain. Thepain level is extremely high. I mean, I was in the factory -- I was in the Gigafactory on Thanksgiving Dayas were many other Tesla people. It's like it's hardcore, okay? Seven days a week, don't have a vacation.So we don't want to repeat that.John Douglas FieldSenior Vice President of EngineeringThe material flow delivery Elon mentioned as we develop very high density and velocity lines, the limitstarts to become how we get material to that line. We'll solve that for the Model 3 line. But eventually,within Fremont, the limit to production may be how many trucks we can get in, how quickly, of material, inorder to build cars.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionYou'd use the Hyperloop for that.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Actually, we are looking at building tunnels using The Boring Company or something because wehave, for example, our seats production is at a separate building on Page. And we have a bunch of trucksmoving seats back and forth between the primary Fremont production and the seat factory. And weactually get constrained on how many trucks can we dock at the -- dock and undock at the seat factory,which is only 0.5 mile or 1 mile away from the vehicle plant. So it'll be pretty easy to just have a tunnel,doing automated conveyance probably from seats to the factory.

I apologize. You did a great job of working capital in the quarter.I mean, I think some of us might kind of throw stones and say it might not be repeatable. But you didit, you got the cash in the door. So it's done and it was -- you did some pretty good work here. Howrepeatable do you think the benefit from working capital is going forward? I mean, is this really just thebenefit of negative working capital and as you ramp up, you'll get this cash inflow? And then also as welook at the customer deposits and the ZEV credits, those were 2, I think, apparently large cash inflows. Imean, how repeatable do you think those are in the future as well?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. Some of those are not repeatable. We significantly reduced the finished goods inventory of Sand X in Q4, which will not repeat itself going forward. And that was a huge impact to our workingcapital. Customer deposits may not be as well, as you pointed out. However, the -- as the Model 3 rampcontinues, the negative working capital needs for that, which essentially creates extra cash for us, will berepeatable. And we'll continue to keep very tight controls on our accounts receivables and everything elsewe do to manage cash to make sure we are being efficient.Martin ViechaThank you very much.

I'm just wondering, it had been several quarters ago kind ofpre Model 3 questions we're hearing more about software you were rolling out to existing customers. Justwondering if you can give us some color on what level of uptake you're seeing. And I would imagine we'renot seeing that in the upfront Model S and X margins, but potentially, there are some sort of -- those arevehicles that are earning assets for you in the future sort of customer ownership. So if you could kind oftalk a little bit about what trends you're seeing there or elaborate a little bit on that, that would be helpful.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I think probably the biggest item is as we get the software right, people upgrading to full self-drivingcapability of S and X, and anything with Hardware 2, which is like the 8 cameras, more advanced opsights and improved compute capability, I think, will be capable of the full self-driving. The full self-driving-- the Hardware 2 set is also capable of doing an easy swap out of the computer. So if it turns out weneed additional computing capability to meet the regulatory standards for self-driving -- particularly likewe think with the current compute hardware, we can get to better than human. But the standard forregulators may be that you need to be 5x better than human or something like that. But we believe that issolvable purely with compute hardware. And it would be a relatively minor expense to do that. So I thinkprobably that's the biggest opportunity.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd along the same lines, not all customers pay for enhanced autopilot too, and as people hear more, wecan see an uptick on that. But it's all around autopilot, to your point.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, exactly. And that -- some of the sort of semiautomated driving definitely doesn't require anyhardware upgrades than that $5,000, that's essentially a software product with 0 cost -- 0 marginal costand so it's 100% margin. And then where full self-driving is available, we can probably -- that's more thana $3,000 increment."
