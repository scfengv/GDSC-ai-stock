        "paragraph": "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Tesla Q3 2020 FinancialResults and Q&A Webcast. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Directorof Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2020 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ3 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. All right. So Q3 was our best quarter in history. We achieved record production anddeliveries, record revenue, record net income, both GAAP and non-GAAP, and record free cashflow of $1.4 billion. This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team. I could not bemore proud to work with such a great group of people. Just really (expletive) performance across --throughout the world.Of course, we had our Battery Day. So we hosted -- showed our plans for how we can expand in thefuture and improve core battery technology, core cell technology at the form factor level, chemistrylevel and I think most significantly at the manufacturing technology level. There's only -- acomment I made in the past is that I think Tesla's long-term competitive strength will be primarilymanufacturing. This is counterintuitive, but I'm quite confident this will be what happens.All right. So we presented what the team has been working on for a long time with batteries. Wewanted to step back and really rethink batteries from scratch. First principles thinking, just look at itfrom fundamental physics and say what -- rather than compare to other products in the market, justsay from a physics standpoint, if you -- what's the limit of physics? What's the platonic idea of aperfect cell and how close can we get there? And that was our aspiration."

        "paragraph": "And I think we've got apretty good approach to it, which will only get better over time. And we went through all of theinteresting solutions for every important part of battery design and production. And we'll continueto iterate on that and just recursively improve the core cell and battery technology. The result, we think, in a few years, will be batteries that cost half as much and where the capitalexpenditures required are 1/3 or less of what they are today. And we expect Giga Berlin will see ourfirst battery cell production line at scale.Regarding the Full Self-Driving beta release. The Autopilot team, again, just a really all-star team. Ispent a lot of time with the Autopilot team. And there's a lot of really talented people in that teamwho've worked incredibly hard to make the -- to get the beta release out. So I'd just really like tothank them for their hard work. And it's just a very smart group of people. So I think we're startingvery slow and very cautiously because the world is a complex and messy place. And so we're -- weput it out there last night, and then we'll see how it goes and then probably release it to more peoplethis weekend or early next week. And then just gradually step it up until we have, hopefully, a widerelease by the end of this year.And of course, as the system collects more data and -- it becomes more robust. So it's sort of likehow does Google as a search engine get better. It's because everyone is programming it by askingquestions all the time and clicking on particular links. So it's got this great feedback loop, and thatmakes it an extremely effective search engine. It's the same thing for autonomy. Having on theorder of 1 million cars that are providing feedback and specifically feedback on strange corner casesituations that you just can't even come up with in simulation, this is the thing that is reallyvaluable. It's not like the obvious stuff, obvious stuff you can do in simulation. But weird cornercases, only a reality can give you that. So that's -- but we're able to say, okay, we need to train thesystem on this corner case situation and look for examples so we can then try it against thoseexamples and improve some very esoteric corner cases.And it's also important to emphasize that this is a generalized neural net-based approach."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "There isno need for high-definition maps or a cellphone connection. So the car -- the system is designedsuch that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you're in a place that you have neverbeen to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like aperson. That is the system that we are developing and aiming to release this year.Then in terms of capacity build out, we're making progress on 3 major factories. We're continuingto expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well. The Tesla China team is just, Imean, incredibly good. Super smart, work hard. It's like I'm always amazed by how much progressthe Tesla China team makes. It's beyond all reasonable expectations.And then we're under construction in Berlin and Texas -- and Austin. So we're also making goodprogress there. Yes. Good. It's overall going well. I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin,we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next year. But because of the exponentialnature of the spool up of a manufacturing plant, especially one with new technology, it will start offvery slow at first and then become very -- upward, will become very large. Just in general,manufacturing follows the S-curve. And I think sometimes, people, if they haven't spent a lot oftime manufacturing, kind of think that once you have a factory, you can just sort of turn it on andit's at capacity. But it will typically take about 12 to 18 months to reach capacity. And that is a veryfast period of time, especially for new technology. So yes, I'd say 12 to 24 months even.So generally, what I see is the manufacturing capacity is underestimated in the beginning for quitesome time. Then it is sometimes overestimated because this is an S-curve. It goes exponential tolinear to logarithmic. And it's actually an incredibly hard thing just bringing a production plant upto volume technology.If -- because you can actually think of it like you've got, through first-order approximation, 10,000unique parts or processes, all of which operate on an S-curve and -- with a bunch of uncertainty, andyou can just slide 10,000 S-curves on an X-axis, and that's what bringing up a large automotiveplant is like. And which one is the laggard, which one is the leader, it's very difficult to tell, and it'sconstantly changing."

        "paragraph": "So it's really one of the most difficult challenges I've ever seen.So let's see. In conclusion, thank you. What we've achieved would not be possible without theincredible hard work of tens of thousands of Tesla employees and all people at our suppliers aswell. I'd like to thank our suppliers. We continue to grow as fast as we can while focusing on costcontrol and improving quality. And ultimately, the best company will be that which makes greatproducts at an affordable price, and that's our goal. I think I've never felt more optimistic about thefuture of Tesla than I do today. I'd also like to thank investors who have stuck with us through thickand thin. This is -- I think there's a lot more good stuff to come.All right. With that, we can move to questions.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Elon. I think our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, has some opening remarks as well.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorOkay. Sure.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. Overall, our financial health continues to rapidly improve with Q3 beinganother great quarter on nearly all dimensions, as Elon has mentioned. On net income, we achievedour fifth sequential quarter of profitability, our best net income, and nearly double-digit operatingmargins.Two things that are important to note to set context for Q3 profitability. First, the regulatory creditsbusiness was stronger than our expectations, and we are tracking to more than double this yearcompared to last. Second, as a result in the rise of the market cap of the company, the second andthird tranche of the CEO grant vested during the quarter. Additionally, we have begun expensing 1more tranche, resulting in roughly $300 million of combined period expense.I think it's reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the healthof the core business.On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from 18.7% to23.7%, with some of our programs achieving greater than 25% gross margin. Keep in mind thatinefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2. We continue to reduce ourmanufacturing and operational costs. We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend oflocally built and delivered cars, which has increased from under 50% at the beginning of last year toover 70% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction strategy."

        "paragraph": "We are alsoseeing financial benefits from improved vehicle reliability across the feet -- across the fleet.Services and other margin approved yet again, driven by our used vehicle business and efficienciesin our service operations. In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided bythe positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deploymentsgrow. Additionally, our solar deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on thatfront.On cash flows, our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash flows of $1.4billion, our highest yet. Our operating cash flows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million benefitfrom working capital as we've made progress on days of receivables and inventory despite areduction in days of payables. Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by thestrengthening of our core operations.Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y investments in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin.As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting theseprograms to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund. This isdriven by an increase in in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturingas well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future. While we expect thereturn on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope andlocation-specific costs, the payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we sawin Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont.Financing cash flows were $4.5 billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a$5 billion equity raise in September. Note that we're currently expecting over $1 billion in earlyconvert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and2024.Looking forward, we remain focused on strengthening the core fundamentals of the business. Weare increasing production to meet demand, reducing costs, including localization, driving higherefficiency across the business and tightening our cash conversion cycle. We've made tremendousprogress on this front over the last 1.5 years. We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year."

        "paragraph": "While thisgoal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it's possible with tight execution across the company.So congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year. I'll hand it over to RJJohnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a fewcomments.RJ Johnson - Tesla, Inc. - Global Head of Commercial EnergyThank you, Zach. First, I'd like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done. Q3 wasa strong quarter for the Energy business, and we're poised for continued strong growth in Energystorage and solar. Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business, anddeployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity. We have moredemand than supply through 2021, and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedenteddemand across the globe through 2023 and beyond. Our order book is rapidly filling up through2023 in a multiple gigawatt-hour scale.Large-scale solar plus storage is now more cost-effective than traditional fossil fuel generation inmany locations across the globe. This trend will continue as we remove cost, which will furtherdisplace existing and new fossil fuel generation. This is true for stand-alone storage as well.Many customers are utilizing Autobidder to maximize returns as we optimize our hardware andsoftware with advanced real-time bidding strategies that continue to outperform the market wheredeployed. For Powerwall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seekincreased reliability and backup home generation. We have a very large backlog of Powerwallorders, and we continue to invest to increase capacity to fulfill customer orders. We're just nowcapturing the full power of customer-sited solar plus storage as customers in some jurisdictions areproviding services back to the grid when they don't need to consume energy or have backup power.This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally.In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $1.49 a watt after taxincentives, which is the lowest in the industry. We're able to do this by leveraging our online vehicleordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft costs associated with sales andmarketing. As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiencyincrease, leading to increased profitability in the retrofit business."

        "paragraph": "We're using the samemethodology across the entire Energy business, including service, to capitalize on the technologybackbone of the company.Solar Roof is especially exciting as we've gained significant experience over the last year in theinstallation process, which is a key enabler to scale the business. We've recently demonstrated ourability to complete Solar Roof installation in just 1 day. Please note, this still requires 1 to 2 days toremove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof installation. Clearly, there will be a rangeof installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors. Overall, our reducedinstallation time provides a better customer experience and will enable the business to growexponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus onincreasing scale while reducing cost to maximize profitability. I want to thank the team again fortheir hard work, and I look forward to another strong quarter ahead of us."

        "paragraph": "Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, everyone. And let's begin with questions from say.com. The first questionfrom retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start 4680 cell production at Giga Berlin at the sametime as vehicle production? Can Tesla share more information on what products will use the batterycells from the pilot line in Fremont?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Drew, do you want to take that?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSure. Yes, we will incorporate 4680 design solutions into many applications in time across bothenergy and vehicle. And we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the newfactory in Berlin as it ramps.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. Let's go to the next question, which is question #2 from retail shareholders.Does Tesla's tabless cell design allow for significantly higher peak charging rates? Does it improvethe required taper curve?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. The fundamental limitation on charge rate in lithium-ion batteries is avoiding lithium platingon the anode. And while the tabless architecture helps avoid overheating because it's a more power-dense architecture at high continuous charge rates, it doesn't change the anode plating story. Electrodesign and anode material choice more directly determines the maximum charge rate and how toavoid that lithium plating problem.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Thank you very much. The third question from retail is, would FSD be able to be transferredto our next vehicle or pay a transfer fee? It would add a broad -- it would add to brand loyalty thesame way gaming companies and cellphone companies keep you in their ecosystem by letting youtransfer purchases to upgraded hardware.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think we'll give it some thought.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The fourth question is, what are the remaining constraints to be solved for Solar Roofinstallations to ramp significantly? Carl?Carl Peterson - Tesla, Inc. - Director of EngineeringYes. I'm Carl Peterson. I'm on the Solar Roof engineering and installation. The biggest constraintright now in Solar Roof ramp is getting enough installers on board and trained and experienced.We've made a lot of progress on this in Q3, and we're continuing to hire."

        "paragraph": "The next opportunity isimproving the material flow on the job site. We've talked about this a lot in the factory as well thatsetting up the right packaging, kitting so that every installer on the roof has the parts they need attheir fingertips. Also, we've had great response from third-party roofing contractors as they'reramping up installations for Solar Roof on their customer homes, which is a big source of futuregrowth.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Carl.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean here's the way to think about that product, in my opinion. You have to say, I think, whatdo you want the world to look like? When you look around the neighborhood in the future, decadefrom now, what do you want? What products are going to make your life better? What future doyou want? And I think a future where we've got beautiful roofs with -- generating energy that aretough and resilient and better in every way than a regular roof and alive with energy, that's thefuture we want. Solar Roof is a killer product. This will become obvious next year.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. And the last question from retail shareholders is, you recently referred to Tesla as aconglomerate of start-ups. Other than manufacturing electric cars, what do you suppose will be themost valuable business units within Tesla over the next 5 to 7 years? Could you envision any ofthem ever spinning out from Tesla?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, yes, as I think about this today, I mean Tesla is probably -- there's in excess of a dozen start-ups effectively in Tesla. Every major product line is a start-up. Every new -- big new plant is a start-up. And sometimes, frankly, we have to learn the lesson a few times before it sinks in. But eventhings like service and sales are start-ups. Other car companies, OEMs, they don't own their salesand service. So we have to create our service network. We have to create our sales and deliverynetwork. We have to do this in, I don't know, 40 countries, multiple languages. Something thatpeople don't really even know much about is our internal applications team that writes the coretechnology that runs the company.We are not dependent on enterprise software."

    {
        "paragraph": "Like for those who understand what this means, this isa very big deal. And my hat is off to the great work of the internal applications team. They are likethe nervous system, the operating system of the company, the Tesla operating system, extremelyfundamental. Obviously, insurance is substantial. So insurance could very well be, I don't know,30%, 40% of the value of the car business, frankly. And as we've talked about before, with a muchbetter feedback loop, instead of being statistical, it can be specific. And obviously, somebody doesnot have to choose our insurance. But I think a lot of people will. It's going to cost less and bebetter, so why wouldn't you?And the whole autonomy thing is a start-up. The computer chip was -- designing our computerchips was a start-up. Obviously, cells are a start-up. Designing and making our own powerelectronics for the drive units, designing, manufacturing our own motors. Chargers, theSupercharger network is a start-up. The thing, I think, that people just don't really understand aboutTesla is that it's a whole chain of start-ups. And they're like, well, you didn't do that before. Yes, butwe're doing it now. I mean I think, so far, we have not -- we've maybe been a bit slow with some ofthe start-ups, but I don't think we've had any of them fail. So, so far, so good. No plans to spinanything out. That just sounds like added complexity.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. Let's go through institutional investor questions. The question #1 is, as abridge to the ride-hailing network, could you leverage the insurance product to give customers theability to rent out their vehicles via the app, thereby enabling the car to make money for them? Sobasically proprietary version of Turo.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWe're -- I think we're going to focus on enabling the robotaxi system. So you can just basically --like that's a sub -- that's just really quite a small subset of the overall robotaxi or robocar thing,where you can have the car be autonomous for you. You can have the car be -- share with friendsand family. You can add or remove it from the network. You can have it be entirely in the network. Imean if you're an Uber or Lyft driver, you could be managing a fleet of 10 cars."

        "paragraph": "This sort of seemslike a shepherd tending the flock type of thing. It's like you just get more, way more leverage. So Ithink that's sort of -- we could do that. It wouldn't be very difficult, but we're going to just befocused on just having an autonomous network that has sort of elements of Uber, Lyft and Airbnb.Yes.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. And the second question from institutionals is, residential energy use accounts forroughly the same magnitude of carbon emissions as road transport. Today's boilers and aircon unitsare profoundly unsexy. Could you elaborate on hints that HV AC advances with the Y could alsofind use in a domestic system?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Go ahead, Drew.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringI was just going to say, I mean, I think one of the things we focused on with the Model Y and nowModel 3 heat pump system was learning how to build a tightly integrated system capable of movingheat to and from anywhere really, powertrain, battery, cabin, the environment, in -- outside ambienttemperatures, all the way down to like negative 20 C, so 30 C. And that's definitely applicable to thehome needs of heating and cooling the home and the water in your house, so certainly applicable.Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely. I think like the heat -- for heat pump in the car, being able to use the batteries bothas a thermal and an electric energy reservoir is very significant. Same thing could be applied to ahome with the water heater, so -- and the back of pack itself, of course. So I think there's potentialfor an integrated home system that kind of does power generation/storage, heating/cooling, airfiltration, water purification in a really tight package. We don't actually have like a prototype oranything, but I think conceptually, that is something that would be probably good to have.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. The third question from institutionals is, if meeting your long-term volume targetsrequires price reductions that preclude you from achieving your low double-digit stated margintargets for the auto business, will you still reduce prices accordingly?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "- Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we want to make our cars more affordable, and it's really important to separate outaffordability from value for money. If the car is too expensive or any given product is tooexpensive, then -- and people don't have enough money in their bank account, they simply can't buyit no matter what the value proposition is. So it is important to lower the prices in order to -- suchthat people can literally just have enough money to buy it. I do not think we lack for desire for ourproduct, but we do lack for affordability. And so we have to improve the affordability of ourproducts so they are not out of reach of people. We want to bring them more in reach over time butalso improve our cost of production. Obviously, we get hopefully a little bit better every year,sometimes a lot better. And in terms of margins, all of these margins are going to look prettycomically small when you factor in autonomy.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. 2 things I'll add to that. Without a doubt, I mean, we're moving forward to push as muchvolume as we reasonably can. So Elon talked to earlier kind of how the S-curve and the time line ofincremental factories looks like. And so we're moving full speed ahead with as much volume as wecan reasonably move forward with. The second comment I'd make is, if you just look at the journeyof the company over the last 1.5 years, we have grown volumes and grown gross margins despite anumber of price reductions over that period of time, and we have cut OpEx fairly stable during thatperiod of time as well.And so the key is what Elon mentioned here. I mean we have to improve the affordability of thevehicle. We have to also continue to make progress improving the cost structure of not only COGSbut of OpEx, which we've demonstrated over the last 1.5 years, I think, quite successfully, andimprove the value of the vehicles at the same time. So in addition to reducing the cost of the car,we're making the cars better. And that's the formula to sell the volume. That's what we're focusedon.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much."

        "paragraph": "The fourth question from institutionals is, at what point do you expect tohave enough internal or external battery capacity to start ramping up stationary storage deploymentsagain?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. We're ramping up stationary storage a lot. So I mean, it's approximately doubling. We expectit's approximately double next year. So that's pretty good. And hopefully, we can accelerate that inyears to come.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd approximately doubling it this year, too. So the growth...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, yes, yes. I mean if you just keep doubling things, pretty soon, you hit the mass of the universe,and we'll need to start turning Jupiter into cells.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRAnd the last question from institutionals is, manufacturing is hard. Delays happen. Whatcontingencies do you have in place to ensure that bottlenecks that you might encounter whilerenting internal cell production will not preclude you from your ability to hit your Model Yproduction volume targets in Berlin and Texas?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So I think it's -- we're trying to derisk 2021 so that there's almost no dependency on ourinternal cell production. It's very, very small. The internal cell production will help us ramp in '22,but we're not dependent on it for '21.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd to derisk the manufacturing system itself, that was one of the reasons why we located our pilotproduction facility here in Fremont, so we can rapidly iterate on manufacturing scale-up challenges,provide rapid feedback to the design of both the product and the equipment.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And our pilot line is pretty big as pilot lines go. It's -- it will be in the top 10 cell factories onEarth, I believe.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, that's true.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorSubscale one, yes, so...Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And now we can go to questions from analysts online.

        "paragraph": "Our first question will come from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystJust wanted to ask about the targets from your Battery Day. Looked like you could be approachingsomething like 20 million vehicles by 2030 if you hit those goals. Could you maybe share with us alittle bit more of a midterm target, like where would you be by 2025? And maybe give us a little bitmore insight into the investment required to get there, just to put that extra $2 billion to $2.5 billionper year into context.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean I think the tricky thing with trying to predict things midway through an exponential isthat if things are doubling every year or even just growing 50%, then if you shift 1 -- plus/minus 1year, it has a huge effect on the number. So -- and it sounds like, wow, you either massivelyexceeded or massively undershot. But it's -- actually, what's going on is a giant S-curve. So a wholebunch of pretty big S-curves that integrate into a gigantic S-curve. So that's why it's difficult topredict the middle. And I'm not saying for sure we'll hit 20 million vehicles. But it does seem like agood goal to have because that would mean that we're replacing 1% of the global fleet per year.And it's difficult to say that we're -- are we really changing the world if we're not switching out 1%of the global fossil fuel vehicles? I mean it's -- I'm not sure that we can make that argument unlesswe change at least 1% of the vehicles per year. So that's where the 2 -- the 20 million vehicle peryear comes from. It's like 1% of 2 billion vehicles, which is the global fleet currently. The globalfleet is growing. So probably will be a bit bigger in the future. So it's hard to say. It's like map an S-curve to a $20 million -- a 20 million vehicle target in 2030, and we will slide it around and seewhat that number looks like. That will give you about as much insight as we have.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystOkay."

        "paragraph": "And just secondly, if solid-state lithium metal were to become viable, could you just maybejust pass along your perspective on that? And would you be able to repurpose most of what you'reputting into place for changes in technology?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean answering the first part, the cell production system is fairly agnostic on anode, cathode,electrolyte, separator, that kind of thing. It's -- we could change, and we will change, and upgradethe -- all aspects of the cell. So -- and we could, for example, make ion phosphate or nickelmanganese or something like that. It's quite adaptable. So I wouldn't say just too much more aboutit. The lithium, like a pure lithium anode is maybe not -- it's not as great as it may sound. Yes.V olumetrically, you're not gaining all that much because if you got nothing on the -- let's say on theanode side, you got -- and you just play out lithium, it's got to go somewhere, so you got to haveroom for it.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Lithium is less volumetrically dense in the pure metal form than it is intercalated into silicon.So it's kind of hard to understand, but that's the truth. And then as we showed in our presentation,the total anode cost that we're talking about is only $1 or $2 per kilowatt hour. So the value of likeremoving the anode material isn't super high either. So yes, I fully agree, Elon.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. But if it turned out that a pure lithium anode is the right move, that would simply --that would be no problem.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringRight. Agreed."

Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior AnalystWell, cell manufacturing, I'm pretty sure as well as on the molds that you talked about. But in termsof the CapEx budget that you mentioned earlier, talking about the -- a number of processes comingin-house and which equipment pieces you're planning to make yourself versus buying?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorOkay. Well, I mean, Tesla is absolutely vertically integrated compared to other auto companies orbasically most any company. We have a massive amount of internal manufacturing technology thatwe built ourselves. We literally make the machine. In fact, we design it -- so like, okay, what are thethings we want to make, design a machine that will make that thing, then we make the machine.This is what -- this makes it quite difficult to copy Tesla, which we're not actually all that opposedto people copying us, but it's quite difficult because you can't do catalog engineering. You can't justI'll pick up the supplier catalog, I'll get one of those machines, one of that machine, bingo, I'm nowTesla.You have to -- there is no catalog. What catalog -- so we made the machine that made the machinethat made the machine. It gets -- no, no, we don't want to get carried away here. But -- and quitefrankly, we would like to outsource less. That would be great. Because then if we could outsource --if we take something that we're doing and outsource it, then we could take those people, and they --we're going to have them do something else.But yes, it's like we're just making a crazy amount of machinery internally. This is -- Tesla is notwell understood. If you just walk around the factory, you'd just get a sense for it. And -- yes. I don'tknow if this is like a smart move."

You guyshave run off, land, and you've got a lot more cushion at this point. And obviously, there'sopportunities around insurance to drive out some of the cost of ownership as well as financials.How are you guys thinking about that as you move into trying to accelerate demand a little bit andyour ability to leverage your access to capital and enable some of those other products? Is thatchanging from where you've been in the past?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean something like insurance is a good example of a product that's basically made by ourinternal applications team. So we made the insurance product and connect it to the car, look at thedata, calculate the risk. This is all internally -- basically internal software application. It's pretty lowcapital but has very high return. I don't know. We're trying to spend money at the fastest rate that wecan possibly spend it and not waste it. That's our current plan. And so it's quite hard to spend moneywithout wasting it, or just -- we're like really just trying to not waste too much of it, frankly. We willcertainly waste some of it, but trying to waste, not to waste too much of it, this is very difficult. Butotherwise, we just try to spend money as quickly as possible in a way that is sensible and yieldsmore value than it costs."

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I don't know how much he cares about this, but I guess, he sure is investing a lot of money init. I mean I think you obviously need to focus -- if you care about autonomy, you need to focus onvision because the entire road system is based on passive optical.

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureA very simple one. You haven't talked that much about like the Cybertruck today. And I waswondering how like the ramp of that product is looking like. When we should see the producthitting the road? And how fast do you expect to ramp volumes? Then I have a quick follow-up.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorSure. I was in the studio actually on -- last Friday with Franz and the team just going over just sortof some improvements to the Cybertruck. Generally, with -- at Tesla, we really aim to make the carthat is delivered better than the car that is unveiled. Because it always drive me crazy, carcompanies would unveil these awesome looking cars, like, great, you can't wait until they makethat. And then the car they actual make is like much worse, and -- but it's just -- it's like reallydisappointing? So man, we always want to make the car that we deliver be better than the car weunveil. And that's the goal with the Cybertruck. So there's like a lot of small improvementscompared to what was unveiled. I think it's going to be better than what we showed. And yes, it'scool. Like it's going to be made in Austin. So it's kind of dependent on completing that factory. Andthere are obviously new technologies with the high hardness kind of armored exoskeleton.This is -- it's never been done before, so there'll probably be some challenges along the way. Andobviously, something that's extremely high hardness and difficult to scratch or dent is also difficultto form. So it's -- there's manufacturing challenges there. That's why it's so cleaner. Although it alsolooks good, I think, from a cleaner standpoint.Yes. If all goes well, we'll be able to do some Cybertruck deliveries towards the end of next year,yes. So it's difficult to predict. I would say there's probably a lot of deliveries in '22 and somedeliveries towards the end of next year if things go well.Pierre C.

Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of wheredirectionally Model Y and China Model 3 gross margin was in the quarter relative to FremontModel 3? And then just a little more color on the gross margin in the quarter. Was this just purely afunction of higher volume? Or was there also FSD revenues? Just puts and takes on the grossmargin in the quarter.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release. It'snot particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter. With respect to product margins,what we're seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really across every product.Shanghai continues to make good progress there. Model Y cost is also coming down quite quicklyas we ramp that. But we've guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to theModel 3 built in Fremont costs. It's not quite there, and it's also a bit of a moving target. As Model 3Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to come down with that. But we're generally seeingstrength in Shanghai margin, strength in Model Y margins. And not too far off of this, we're seeingstrength in Model 3 Fremont, S and X margins. So overall, for the quarter, I think it was quite agood story for the products.Dan Meir Levy - Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystGreat. Great. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about your strategy in Europe. And Ithink your strategy generally has been you cut costs and that allows you to cut price, and you cangenerate the extra volume. And I think that's what we're seeing in China and the use of LFP. That's agood example. So once you ramp in Berlin, what's the reasonable expectation of what pricing mightlook like in Europe? And how flexible are you going to be on pricing to generate incremental regcredit, so margins out of the gate that are a little low, but that are then used for the reg credits thathelp to offset that?Zachary J.

If you could just walk us through the development of Megachargers,platooning and maybe just how you think about autonomy for Tesla Semi and what is -- how youenvision it impacting the broader trucking industry beyond just EV .Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, actually, Jerome, do you want to answer that?Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionYes. We continue the development of the Semi. And in particular, Megachargers, we realized thatthe 350-kilowatt or so that we might be looking for cars is not going to be enough for Semi. Sowe're looking for something much more powerful than that, that can achieve essentially charging atfirst the Semi as during a break, during your driving time so that you can drive until the next break,yes. So there is no usable or efficient time wasted for charging the Semi. That's the goal. We'reworking with other parties to make sure that there is a standard infrastructure that will be able to bedeployed for all customers. Yes. That's probably all I can say at this point, yes. So we're notworking on...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorSorry, go ahead.Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionJust we're not working in isolation. Yes. We're trying to -- we have to invent it because it doesn'texist. But we're trying to invent something that could be helpful for everybody.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Just a note on the sort of Semi. The Semi does consume a lot of cells. So it's, call it, 4 to 6xmore than a passenger vehicle. Vehicle, 5, 5x-ish. So if we are cell-constrained, it is -- it kind of --it's difficult to ramp up the Semi because there's no cells. So we need to solve the cell constraintbefore ramping Semi to significant volume. That's the only real constraint on Semi's progress. Andjust we found over and over again, we just kept running into cell production limitations. And thenwe're just taking things out of one pocket and putting them in another. So we just need more cells sothat we can do more stationary storage, more vehicles, more vehicle lines."

Incorporated, Research Division - SeniorResearch AnalystElon, what do you think the biggest structural issue is with the, let's call it, old school OEMs, or 1or 2 of the structural issues, for them not getting their act together and catching up with you? Andthen you mentioned what you -- we want the world to look like ahead of us. What do you envisionthat? Is it like just Tesla or Tesla and Rivian or what?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I do think there will be other car companies. I don't think we're going to be the only one. So Imean, the things that -- like what other car companies do even in the auto segment is quite a smallsubset of what Tesla is. So Tesla, we design and build. We're very vertically integrated. So we'redesigning and building so much more of the car than other OEMs who will largely go to thetraditional supply base and like I call it, catalog engineering. So it's not very adventurous, and itbasically ends up like older products end up looking the same because they're going to the samesuppliers.So I mean, to the degree that you inherit legacy components, you inherit the legacy limitations andcost structure. And so you kind of need to make new ingredients, new parts, and then you need --then there's no machine to make those parts. So you have to make the machine that makes the part.So Tesla is like -- we're probably -- I mean we might be, in order of magnitude, more verticallyintegrated than other car companies. And which we're not now, we certainly will be. And then wealso have to create actually our sales and service and distribution system in, I don't know, somethingin the order of 40 countries, somewhere, it will be over 100 countries. Whereas the other carcompanies do not own their sales and service and distribution. So they kind of assemble parts froma supplier base and then hand them to a dealer base. So it's just like -- it's not just -- it's likecomparing Tesla to a car company, like just comparing just really one facet or dimension of Tesla,we're like maybe 10% in common with other car companies."

The first one for me is try to understand your business model for stationary storage, haveyour thoughts on it. I mean there are 2 broad directions for me. One is selling hardware, which is abit of a cost-plus business. And I'm just wondering if there's an opportunity where Tesla couldactually share into the savings that utilities, in particular, could be able to achieve in like gridstabilization. The information I was able to get on your business in Australia a few years agosuggest that given the savings that are achieved, your hardware could have been sold at a higherprice. I'm just wondering if you have -- can share your views on where the business probably isgoing.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, I think you're probably right about that. I mean RJ and Zach, what do you guys think?RJ Johnson - Tesla, Inc. - Global Head of Commercial EnergyYes. I mean we're already seeing this in Australia, where we're seeing behind-the-meter aggregationthat is providing grid services back to the grid, which effectively reduces the price to the customerand reduces the prices for the grid operator. So you're seeing this trend happening across the globe.And it's going to be at the residential level as well as the wholesale level. So Megapack on one endand then Powerwall on the other side.

I mean -- yes.Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Automotive AnalystAnd long term, are we talking -- yes?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI mean several years from now. It's not like existing cars stop having value. It's just that if you havea structural pack, where the pack is contributing structural value to the car because of like the -- sortof like the composite honeycomb effect of share transfer between upper and lower plate, thenanything that doesn't do that is going to have to have duplicate hardware. It's going to weigh more.It's going to cost more. And then the same goes for the front and rear castings.To be frank, we're trying to make the car like you'd make a toy. If you had a toy model car, howwould -- and then it's got to be real cheap and look great, how would you make that? You'll cast it.And that's how it's done. It would be absurd to make it up of tiny little pieces of stamp metal joinedin complex ways. So it's sort of a natural thing to do.And then the same goes for using the energy storage, the battery as a structure, which is done foraircraft wings and for rockets. The early rockets and aircraft, they had a separate aeroshell from thepropellant tanks or fuel tanks, and then they realized that doesn't make sense. And you've got tointegrate -- you've got to have your fuel tank in wing shape. You've got to have your propellanttanks in the shape of the body of the rocket, for example. You don't want to put a box on a box,basically. So -- which over many years made it like basically uncompetitive to have an aircraft thathas separate fuel tanks from the wings.
