        "paragraph": "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast. My nameis Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhornand a number of other executives.Our Q2 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time, and the update deck, we published atthe same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you, Martin. So just a Q2 recap. In Q2, we achieved record vehicle production and deliveriesand record revenue of about $25 billion in a single quarter. And Model Y became the best-sellingvehicle of any kind globally in Q1, surpassing the likes of Corolla and Golf. So it was the #1vehicle of any kind, including vehicles that are sold at a far lower price. This was, I think, anincredible achievement by the Tesla team, and just a huge thank you to our customers for theirsupport.And this came in spite of high interest rates and a lot of macro uncertainty. And nonetheless, wemanaged to achieve operating margin of about 10%. We continue to target 1.8 million vehicledeliveries this year, although we expect that Q3 production will be a little bit down because we'vegot summer shutdowns for a lot of factory upgrades, so just probably a slight decrease in productionin Q3 for sort of global factory upgrades.And the long-term economy we think is going to just drive volume through the ceiling, next level.And our sort of future robotaxi products, the dedicated robotaxi products, we think have a quasi-infinite demand. The way we're going to manufacture the robotaxi is also itself a revolution. And soit's a revolutionary sign made in a revolutionary way. It will be, by far, the highest units per hour ofany vehicle production ever. And I'm so very excited about that.With respect to Autopilot and Dojo, in order to build autonomy, we also need to train our neural netwith data from millions of vehicles."

    {
        "paragraph": "The more -- I mean, this has been proven over and over again,the more training data you have, the better the results. And I mean, there are times where we seebasically, in a neural net basically, it's sort of, at a million training examples, it barely works at 2million, it slightly works at 3 million. It's like, \"Wow, okay, we're seeing something.\" But then youget to like 10 million training examples, it's like -- it becomes incredible. So there's just nosubstitute for a massive amount of data. And obviously, Tesla has more vehicles on the road that are collecting this data than all other companies combined by, I think, maybe even an order ofmagnitude. So I think we might have 90% of all -- a very big number.So the success in AI and dev is a function of talent, sort of unique data and computing resources.And we have outstanding capabilities in all 3 arenas. And I really just don't know how anyone coulddo what we're doing, even if they had our software and had our computer, if they did not have thetraining data.So speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost ofneural net training. It is designed to -- it's somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need,which is a video training. So we just see that the need for neural net training, again, talking of beinga quasi-infinite of things, is just enormous. So I think having -- we expect to use both NVIDIA andDojo, to be clear. But there's -- we just see a demand for really advanced training resources. And wethink we may reach in-house neural net training capability of 100 [exoblocks] by the end of nextyear.So today, over 300 million miles have been driven using FSD Beta. That 300 million-mile numberis going to seem small very quickly. It will soon be billions of miles, tens of billions of miles. Andthe FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human. We see aclear path to full self-driving being 10x safer than the average human driver. And betweenAutopilot and Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of hardware 3,4. But it's really dedicated. It's a high-efficiency inference computer that's in the car."

        "paragraph": "And ourOptimus robot, Tesla's really at the cutting edge of AI development.With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build release candidates of the Cybertruck on ourfinal production line in Austin. I'm actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory. This is the first truckthat we're aware of that will have 4 doors over a 6-foot bed and will fit into a 20-foot garage. So it'sthe biggest on the outside, but it's even bigger on the inside. So I think that's -- one of the elementsof good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. And this is no smallcar, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last millimeter.So just trying to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small, and thenreally maximize the utility of the volume. And we can't wait to start delivering it later this year.Some other highlights. Our global Supercharging network now stands at over roughly 50,000connectors and over 5,000 locations. As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla chargingstandard, which we made open source, and it's now called the North American Charging Standard,we're deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use ourconnector and gain access to our charging network. We strongly believe in helping other carcompanies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right thing, in general. So that'sour goal there.Then I think what I want to emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point, is thatTesla, just as with the North American Charging Standard, although we're not licensing -- in thatcase not licensing, we're just making it available. But we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car companies. And we are already in discussions with --only just early discussions with a major OEM about using Tesla FSD. So we're not trying to keepthis to ourselves. We're more than happy to license it to others. And lastly, our new lithium refineryand cathode facility are progressing well.Now in conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can while maintaininghealthy financials. Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era, and we'reincredibly excited about what's to come."

        "paragraph": "Thank you very much, Elon. And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. As Elon mentioned, Q2 was another record quarter of production anddeliveries as well as records in profit for energy and services and other businesses. Congratulationsagain to the Tesla team on the continued progress.As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility andconsumer confidence and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach.First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the coretechnologies that will drive the long-term value of the business. These include increasing spendingon AI-related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo; as well as new productssuch as Cybertruck, our next-generation platform, and the Semi, as evidenced by the continuedgrowth in our R&D spend. This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion notonly in our vehicle factories but also our supercharging network service, internal applications andbattery processes as we continue with meaningful capital expenditures to lay this foundation for thefuture.Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both our vehicle andenergy business but, most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue ourpace of R&D and capital investments. This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions ineach of our key businesses as well as working capital improvements on raw materials, work-in-process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction andremained healthy, despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.We recognized -- we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, includingmaterial cost and commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidlyincrease the build rate in our Austin and Berlin factories. For our Energy business, we improvedmargins and gross profit driven by cost reductions in deal economics, particularly with Megapack.As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects andtheir specific revenue recognition milestones.As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon's comments on Q3 volumesdriven by planned downtimes for factory upgrades. These upgrades will also carry some amount offactory idle cost. However, we are working to minimize as much as possible."

        "paragraph": "It's also important tokeep in mind the uncertainty in the macro environment, which can impact our execution positivelyor negatively in the near term. Regardless, we continue to remain dynamic with a focus onfundamental efficiency and a long-term outlook.Congratulations again to everybody on a great quarter.OperatorZachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOThank you very much, Zach. And let's go to investor questions. The first question on licensing FSD,we've already answered. So let's go to the second one. The second question is, what is the status of4680 cells? How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day? When do you expect toachieve what you laid out on Battery Day?Unidentified Company Representative -Yes. First, I'll just start with a little bit of a production update. So in Texas, 4680 cell productionincreased 80% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed 10 million production cells produced here inTexas. So congrats to the team for that. Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by 40% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a 25% reduction in cell COGS.Here in Texas, we're preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is 10% higher energy densitythan current production. That was accomplished through process and mechanical designoptimization. As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, weshould be in a comfortable place on cost per cell. Against our battery energy density targets, theCyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like electrochemistry basis. We're yet to integratesilicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring significantfurther energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on at Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment,factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texasscale-up to date."

        "paragraph": "Thank you very much. The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energyproducts and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model? Given Tesla's AI capabilities,how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software margin fromAutobidder as this segment accelerates?Unidentified Company Representative -We can't comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.Megapack continues to show strong demand globally, with Lathrop ramping successfully to meetour contracted projects in 2023. As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place,in line with our target market -- vehicle target margins.The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathropcapacity ahead of our full factory ramp in 2024. We have several exciting large projects inconstruction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, the Riverina project inAustralia, several projects in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we'll tour today,actually. We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with theseprojects.On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets likeAustralia, Texas, U.K. and California with over 6 gigawatt hours under Tesla's dispatch next year.In the U.K., our projects performed best in the industry in Q2. Autobidder does have softwaremargins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it's a relatively small contributor to revenues givenhow much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring. It's important toremember that this large project -- these large capital projects that have lifetimes of 20 years ofrecurring revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small.On the residential side, we have some fun things happening. We recently surpassed 0.5 millionPowerwalls installed. Just this week, we are launching Charge on Solar, which allows TeslaPowerwall and vehicle customers to charge their vehicles using their excess solar and drive only onthe sunshine that hits their roof. Yesterday, we began paying customers in Texas for participating inour virtual power plant to provide grid support to ERCOT. We expect these credits to lower ourmedian customer's annual bill by 1/3 and to increase these credits over time as ERCOT expandsmarket access.And today, we are expanding Tesla electric enrollment to new Model 3 owners in Texas, followedby all Texas vehicle customers over the rest of the quarter."

    {
        "paragraph": "Unfortunately, and somewhat similar toTesla Insurance, bringing Tesla electric and VPP capabilities to our customers requires workingthrough a fractured regulatory environment on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In the long run,the value of residential energy software and hardware will be driven by the level of market accessthat utilities, market operators and regulators permit. For Powerwalls eligible to provide the fullstack of energy services, like peaker capacity and system buffering, such as in Australia, we canmore than double the value of ownership relative to a typical system today."

        "paragraph": "Thank you very much. The next question is, could you quantify the benefits to COGS per unit fromthe IRA battery manufacturing incentives; and secondly, battery raw material declines year-to-date?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOAll right. I can take that. On the first part of the question for IRA manufacturing incentives, weprovided previous guidance that we expect these to be, for the course of this year, in the range of$150 million to $250 million per quarter. We are staying within that foundry as we guidedpreviously, so that was the case in Q2 as well. I will note, and I think we've mentioned this before,that this includes a 50-50 sharing of credits for qualified cells from our long-term battery partner,Panasonic.On the commodity side, we are continuing to see improvements there, as we've discussedpreviously. Lithium is the most notable improvement so far. I think I commented on this on the lastcall because typically, we see this coming about a quarter before. It actually is realized in ourfinancials. And also just as a reminder, we're not fully exposed to the price of lithium. Our supplychain team has done a terrific job in partnership with another -- a bunch of other companies to putin place some long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up and down.We're also seeing benefits in aluminum and steel, which I think is great. Not as large as the lithiumimpacts, but they contribute nonetheless. So if we add up the total impact of this in Q2 relative toprior quarter, it's about the same size and magnitude as the IRA benefits that we also received.Just to put this in context, as you look at COGS per unit sequentially from Q1 to Q2, I think there's2 things to keep in mind there. The first is that our S/X mix for deliveries increased quite a bit fromQ1 to Q2. So as you think about fundamental cost reductions, it's important to adjust for that. Andthen secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin cost, which we did quite abit of that from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above Model Y production costselsewhere. And in the quarter, our mix of Austin- and Berlin-related builds increased."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "And so that'ssomething to consider as you model out the impact from Q1 to Q2 in terms of COGS per unit.I do want to ask Karn if there's anything else on the commodity side or just more generally, youwant to add here?Karn Budhiraj -Yes. As you mentioned, Zach, we've naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium positionbecause of the long-term contracts we have in place. But we have seen reduction in pricing acrossthe board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such as nickel, cobalt and graphite.And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact. We're taking advantage of the historically low commodity pricing in certain areas tokind of expand some of those fixed price contracts through the end of the decade. So it's a playbookthat we'll continue to kind of go back to as we look to the future."

    {
        "paragraph": "Thank you. The next question on FSD, have you considered allowing FSD transferability as a leverto allow existing customers to upgrade to a new Tesla instead of being locked into an existing cardue to the price of FSD?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, this is a question we get asked a lot. So we're excited to announce that for Q3, we will beallowing transfer of FSD. This is a onetime amnesty. So it needs to be -- you need to take advantageof it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within reasonable delivery time frames. So yes, Ihope this makes people happy. And we're not going to repeat. This is a onetime thing."

        "paragraph": "All right. The next question, when will we give more information about the Cybertruck orders,estimated delivery schedules, pricing and specifications?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorDemand is so far off the hook you can't even see the hook. So that's really not an issue. I do want toemphasize that the Cybertruck has a lot of new technology in it, like a lot. It doesn't look like anyother vehicle because it is not like any other vehicle. And the production ramp will move as fast asthe slowest and least lucky elements of the entire supply chain and internal production. So Iwouldn't expect -- I hope it's smooth. We're certainly better at production ramps than -- we've got alot of experience with the production ramps.But first order approximation is there's like 10,000 unique parts and processes in the Cybertruck.And if any one of -- it will go as fast as the least lucky, least well-executed, elements of the 10,000.So it's always difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think we'll be making them in high volumenext year, and we will be delivering the car this year."

Can you share somedetails about the initial repair experience with Gigacast vehicles?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThat must be why everyone's copying us.Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringThanks, Elon. This is Lars. Martin, that's like simply not true. There's a misconception thattraditional bodies are easy to repair, but they are made up of multiple materials and multiple joiningmethods. Spot welds and rivets have to be drilled out. Panels and structural adhesives have to bechiseled down. Dried adhesive has to be removed; stains and cut, blah, blah, blah.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIt's a crazy patchwork quilt.Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringYes. And so putting that back together means time and money. Using an example of replacing a rearcast rail in the Model Y , to do that versus like what we replaced it with in Model 3, it's 10x cheaperand 3x faster to do it with the cast rail. My design team works with our collision repair team sincewe're closed loop on this with Insurance, and we designed specific parts that will make it easier andfaster to repair. And we have an incentive to do that because we have our own insurance and ourown body shops. We expect that we'll continue to do this, and collision repair will continue tobecome cheaper and faster over time. And we already make this available to all body shops, to ourTesla-approved body shop training.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, closing loop on collision repair and factoring that into design is a big deal.Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringIt's crucial. I don't think anyone else can do it with that ecosystem that we have.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. And we are actually able to change the details of the casting with inserts, and we actually dothat all the time, because the inserts actually wear out and need to be replaced anyway. So we canactually make design changes to the inserts and tweak the castings."

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & Director10 million. Yes, I think we're around 5 or 6 bots. I think there's a -- we were at 10, I guess. Itdepends on how many are working and what phase. But it's sort of -- yes, there's more every month.There are a lot of interesting things about the Optimus bot. We found that there are actually nosuppliers that can produce the actuators. There are no off-the-shelf actuators that work well for ahumanoid robot at any price.Unidentified Company Representative -It's certainly not compelling a humanoid robot...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, not a humanoid robot that can do something -- the things that a human could do. So we'veactually had to design our own actuators to integrate the motor, the power electronics, thecontroller, the sensors. And really, every one of them is custom designed. And then, of course, we'llbe using the same inference hardware as the car. But we, in designing these actuators, are designingthem for volume production, so that they're not just lighter, tighter and more capable than any otheractuators whereof that exists in the world. But it's also actually manufacturable. So we should beable to make them in volume. The first Optimus that is will have all of the Tesla designed actuators,sort of production candidate actuators, integrated and walking should be around November-ish. Andthen we'll start ramping up after that.In terms of when we'll be able to do some useful things, like we'll first be trying this out in our ownfactories and just proving out its utility, but I think we'll be able to have it do something useful inour factories sometime next year. I would be -- yes, I'm pretty confident of that. So yes, it's goingwell.I should say another cool thing about Optimus is that there's -- just in the U.S. alone, there are 2million amputees. And I was just talking to the Neuralink team, and by combining a Neuralinkimplant and a robotic arm or leg for someone that has had their arm or leg, or arms and legs,amputated, we believe we can give basically a cyborg body that is incredibly capable. $6 millionman in real life.

        "paragraph": "Thank you. The next question is, how has the order intake trended relatively to production levelsduring Q2? And how has it trended in the quarter-to-date period? Conceptually, how does Tesladecide when is it appropriate to reduce prices or add other sales incentives to increase demand?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I guess demand has roughly tracked production, which is what we aim for, is we look at --something that we have that really, I think, no other carmaker has is that we have real-time demandand real-time production. Like, so 7 days a week, I get an e-mail -- order-generated e-mail whichshows output from all factories and orders globally. So it's like a real-time finger on the pulse ofearth basically. And we adjust course according to what the mood of the public is. Buying a new caris a big decision for a vast majority of people. So any time there's economic uncertainty, peoplegenerally pause on new car buying at least to see what happens.And then obviously, another challenge is the interest rate environment. As interest rates rise, theaffordability of anything bought with debt decreases, so effectively increasing the price of the car.So when interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car because theinterest payments increased the price of the car. And this is -- at least up until recently, it was, Ibelieve, the sharpest interest rate rise in history. So we had to do something about that. And it's notthat I got a crystal ball for the global economy. I really appreciate if I could borrow that crystal ball.Unidentified Company Representative -DM us.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly, DM me. It should be not on Twitter. So I mean, one day, it seems like the worldeconomy is falling apart. And the next day, everything is fine. I don't know what the hell was goingon, to be totally frank. I wish I did. So I mean that's why I say like -- I was on Twitter. I posted, likejust really advising -- because I care a lot about the sort of small shareholders, especially ones thathave stuck with us through thick and thin. I love you, guys. And so we can't control these macroshocks or the thematic depressive nature of the stock market."

Like, I have very high confidence in the long-term value of Tesla.Like, I see it -- I really see a path to a 10x or maybe -- call it a 5x increase in the value of thecompany, maybe a 10x. But where things go along the way, the trials and tribulations and the moodof the markets, one cannot predict. And so the old adage of buy and hold is right.For an investment advice, I'd say like identify a company whose products you love. See if they --does it seem like they'll continue to make good products or great products? Buy that stock and holdit. That's it. You all win. The reason companies exist is to make goods and services, ideally greatgoods and services. They don't exist for any other reason. They shouldn't. So that's why you shouldbuy stock of a company that makes great products and has a great future pipeline. It's commonsense, actually.And then generally, if you see, if you -- provided you're confident about what that company'sproducts or services are, when the market panics, buy. And when the market is overly exuberant,you can sell. I'm not recommending you sell, but buy low, sell high.Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), actually, I think has a saying -- I'm paraphrasing him, but apublicly traded company is like -- imagine you're living in your house and some crazy, manic-depressive guy comes and stands outside your house and yells property prices at you, and it's adifferent price every day, but the house is still the same house.

With the emphasis of price cuts to drive volume growtheating into automotive gross margin, can investors expect to see automotive gross margin stabilizeor even rise due to efficiencies outpacing the cuts? And if so, when?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorOh, man. Where's that crystal ball again? If I may, look, the short-term variances in gross marginand profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture. Autonomy, we'll make all ofthese numbers look silly. I'd recommend looking at ARK Invest. I think their analysis is very good.It's the best I -- and generally, Fintwit or like other finance -- there's a Smart Finance we follow onTwitter, follow their accounts. They're great. So that's, in my opinion, where you'll get the best info.So I strongly believe Tesla is a big long-term investment. And thus, when things go up and down, infact, the market panics, buy. If the market is a little too exuberant, sell at the time. But justgenerally, like, I feel -- I'm confident we'll deliver over the long term but can't control the shortterm. And the autonomy is really where it's at. I mean, Zach, what do you think?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOI fully agree with you. I mean I think the only thing in the short term that matters is what I said inmy opening remarks, which is are we generating enough money to continue to invest. And theportfolio of products and technologies that the technical teams are investing in right now, this isintense. It's intense in terms of investment. It's intense in terms of potential.Elon R.

Soon enough, these quarters will be behind us. They won't be a part of thepresent value of future cash flows of the business. And so we want to make sure we keep that viewand make sure that the long term of the business is exactly the way that we want it to be."

The first question comesfrom Dan Levy from Barclays.Dan Meir Levy - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior AnalystGreat. I wanted to start first with a question about your efforts in AI and Dojo. It's pretty clear, itsounds like you're accelerating your focus. Can you maybe provide us with a sense of what theprocess is of refining a product? Is it more machines? And maybe you could give us a sense ofwhen the payout starts to -- when you start to see the payout and what the resource outlay is, whatshould we expect on the OpEx front as a result of this?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSorry, are you saying how much are we going to spend on Dojo?Dan Meir Levy - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior AnalystYes."

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, we're not going to be open loop on our Dojo expenditures. But I mean, I think we will bespending something north of $1 billion over the next year on -- through the end of next year, it'swell over $1 billion in Dojo. And yes, so I mean we've got a truly staggering amount of video datato do training on. And this is another thing. Like, in order to copy us, you also need to spendbillions of dollars on training compute. I mean it's like -- and it's also hard to. You need the data,and you need the training computers. It's like -- think, all things needed to actually achieve this atscale toward generalized solution for autonomy, this is one of the hottest problems ever. You see alot of AI companies doing LLMs and whatnot. And I'd say, if they're so great, why can't they makea self-driving car? Because it's harder. That's why.But I do think -- that said, I think there's some great AI companies out there. But justfundamentally, the staggering amount of data we've got to process, it's got to be processedsomehow. And custom silicon is the best way to do that. So that's what Dojo is designed to do, isoptimize for video training. It's not optimized for LLMs. It's optimized for video training. Withvideo training, you have a much higher ratio of compute-to-memory bandwidth, whereas LLMstends to be memory bandwidth choked. So that's it.But like I said, we're also -- we have some -- we're using a lot of NVIDIA hardware. We'll continueto use -- we'll actually take NVIDIA hardware as fast as NVIDIA will deliver it to us. Tremendousrespect for Jensen and NVIDIA. They've done an incredible job. And frankly, I don't know, if theycould deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo. But they can't. They've got so manycustomers. They've been kind enough to, nonetheless, prioritize some of our GPU orders. But yes,the sheer magnitude of video training -- because like I said, we're not trying to just get as good ashuman. We want to get to 10x better than human, maybe 100x better than human. Right now, Ibelieve there's something on the order of 1 million automotive deaths per year."

        "paragraph": "And then if you saypermanent serious injuries, I think it's probably closer to 10 million per year. And so it matters ifyou're twice as good as human. Like, 10x better than human would still mean 100,000 deaths and 1million severe permanent injuries. So it's like, okay, we would rather be 100x better.So there's really -- it's a march of knights. And we want to achieve as perfect a safety as possible.And there's truly mind-boggling amounts of video and computer needed for that. And then I dothink there's other applications for Dojo, but we just desperately need it for video training.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOJust to add to what Elon mentioned, so the numbers that he mentioned are between R&D spend andcapital spend. And this is moving quickly. And so we provide a 3-year outlook on our capitalexpense. We are considering these expenses in that outlook. And as that moves up and down, we'llcontinue to update our guidance in the Q.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I want to say the fundamental rate limiter on the progress of full self-driving is training. If wehad more training compute, we would get done faster. So that's it.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOAnd it's just difficult to predict how quickly we can execute on it.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes.Dan Meir Levy - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior AnalystGreat. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, I recognize there's sort of incredible macro uncertainty rightnow, but you're sticking with your near-term volume target of 50% CAGR. As we just think aboutsort of in the year ahead, Cybertruck, there's going to be some contribution. There's going to besome help from further EV penetration growth. But to what extent are you willing to sacrifice onpricing to keep that 50% volume CAGR intact? Or are you thinking differently about marginsversus your prior commentary of willing to sacrifice on margins to get more share?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIt's not about getting more share. It's just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce thathas full autonomy capability as actually something that, in the future, may be worth as much as 5xwhat it is today."

If you'vegot on autonomous -- if that vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use -- so either dedicatedautonomous or partially autonomous, like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to beused by others, sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like doing Airbnb with a room in yourhouse, the value is just tremendous.So I think sort of it would be -- I think it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of makingmore vehicles because we think, in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuationincrease. I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point in which we can upload full self-drivingand is approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history."

        "paragraph": "Thank you. Let's go to the next analyst. The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from DeutscheBank.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystTwo questions from me as well. First, following up on the autonomy. So before you start launchingthese dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you're improving FSD incrementally. Whatis your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version thatwould trigger much higher take rates? And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of FSD?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me, and perhaps quite fairly have made fun ofme, my predictions about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past. The reasonI've been optimistic, what it tends to look like is we'll make rapid progress with a new version ofFSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically. So at first, logarithmic curve looks like this sort offairly straight upward line, diagonal and up. And so if you extrapolate that, then you have a greatthing. But then because it's actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series ofstacked logarithmic curves.Now I know I'm the boy who cried FSD, but man, I think we'll be better than human by the end ofthis year. That's not to say we're approved by regulators. And I'm saying then that, that would be inthe U.S. because we've got to focus on one market first. But I think we'll be better than human bythe end of this year. I've been wrong in the past, I may be wrong this time. And the price of FSD --so the way to think of the price of FSD is actually very low, it's not high. When you go back to whata singular -- the value of the car increased dramatically if it is actually autonomous. $15,000 isactually a low price, not a high price. And we will offer -- I think we do sort of offer FSD as a sortof monthly subscription. Although, like most people don't know that. So I'd recommend like maybetrying it out as a monthly subscription so you don't have to go with the $15,000 thing. But I thinkyes, obviously, if the car is worth several times its original price, $15,000 is actually a low price forFSD."

        "paragraph": "And the next question comes from William Stein from Truist.William Stein - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MDGreat. I'd like to ask about -- so to stick on this AI topic, we've read with great interest thedevelopments in Dojo today, and you've spoken about FSD. But you've also -- Elon, you started thisx.ai company. And for investors that think that there might be quite a bit of value in the AI featuresand products of Tesla, it might be concerning to see you pursuing another endeavor where AI is thefocus. So can you talk about how x.ai might overlap, might perhaps compete, with Tesla or, in otherways, perhaps it enhances the value of what Tesla does?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, I think it will actually enhance the value of Tesla. There were just some of the world's best AIengineers and scientists that were willing to join a startup, but they were not willing to join a large,sort of relatively established company like Tesla. So I was like -- that's actually how it got started. Iwas interviewing a few people. And they're like, 'No, we want to do a startup.\" I was like -- andthat's all -- I couldn't convince them to join Tesla. So I was like, \"Okay, well, better to start up that,that I run this, than they go work somewhere else.\" That's kind of the genesis of xAI. And xAI isfocused on sort of AGI. Yes. So it's -- like I said, I think there will be some value that xAI brings toTesla.Also, some of the very best people in the world, they really just want to work on interestingproblems. So if you take, say, our materials science group, really what convinced CharlieKuehmann to leave Apple, where he was very happy and well compensated, and both at -- to wherewe think is the best materials science group in the world, was that he got to work at both Tesla andSpaceX. He wasn't willing to leave Apple if it was just Tesla, but he was willing to do it if it wasTesla and SpaceX. So sometimes you get the best talent in the world, that's the kind of thing youneed to do."

        "paragraph": "And that actually has been very beneficial to Tesla.William Stein - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MDAnd if I could squeeze one more mundane question in, I wonder if you think you can hit the 1.8million unit number with current pricing or do you anticipate needing to continue to lower prices?Because it seems like they've stabilized, the trends have stabilized, in the last maybe 1.5 months.Should we expect the sort of continued decreases or more stabilization for the rest of the year?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSure. We have sort of restarted the referral program, which I think will be quite effective. As Zachwas saying earlier, we don't control the macroeconomic conditions. So if interest rates continue torise, that reduces the affordability of cars. And for a lot of people, they're really kind of just barelybreaking even every month. In fact, if you look at the rise in credit card debt, they are, in fact, notbreaking even every month. Like, credit card debt is freaking scary. So yes, we just don't control themarket conditions. If market conditions stabilize, I think prices will be stable. If they're not stable,then we would have to lower prices then. Yes."

The next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.Mark Trevor Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity AnalystTesla has been making progress reducing costs and did so again last quarter. Can you give an updateon when you think automotive COGS per vehicle could be under the historical $36,000 per vehiclelevel? And what are the key puts and takes to get there?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOThis is -- I think I was asked this in the past. This is very difficult to forecast. There's a series ofcosts that we manage, the series of cost in which we don't control. And so particularly on thecommodity side, where labor cost go, et cetera, it's just hard to say.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. And we saw very inflationary -- like strong inflationary pressures for a while last year, and now-- which obviously makes it very difficult to reduce COGS. And now we're seeing what seems to bedeflationary pressures, certainly deflationary -- deflation isn't pressure. But we're seeing commodityprices dropping as was mentioned -- as Karn mentioned a moment ago. And look, I mean what doyou think? I mean, basically, the trends seem to be deflationary at the commodity level.Karn Budhiraj -Definitely. There's that, and then there's also the unit economics improve as volumes grow. That'sthe other thing we're seeing. As we're becoming a bigger and better part of a lot of suppliers, theeconomies of scale come into play. There's equipment depreciation that comes into play. Equipmentthat was commissioned 5 to 7 years ago, that used to be a part of the piece price, that's completelyamortized. So we'll see situations where the piece price comes down because that equipmentcontribution has gone away. And then just as we continue to have this mentality of continuousimprovement in terms of labor, reducing labor, improving automation, and just continue to getbetter at what we do. So we have seen -- I think every quarter, we have seen an improvement. Ofcourse, the commodities spike up and down. Just in general, the trend is towards being moreefficient.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes, I totally agree.Elon R.

We are downpre-pandemic expedited cost levels now, and our goal is to go further down.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. So when we look at our progress from Q1 to Q2 on cost, the way that we look at it internally,normalized for the impacts of mix shift, with Austin and Berlin being a higher percentage of ourmix; normalized for S and X being a higher percentage of our mix in Q2 versus Q1. The sequentialcost reduction, it might be the largest we've had in a while. So I think it's great work on behalf ofthe Tesla team, and we just got to keep it up.Elon R."
