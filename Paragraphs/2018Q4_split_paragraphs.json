        "paragraph": "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Tesla, Inc. Q4 2018 Financial Results andQ&A Webcast. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director of InvestorRelations. Mr. Viecha, you may begin.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2018 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and a number of otherexecutives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter wepublished at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectThanks, Martin. Last year was definitely the most challenging year in Tesla history, but also themost successful. Thanks to the incredible work of the Tesla team, Model 3 became the best-sellingpremium vehicle in the U.S. for 2018. And in fact, when considering battery electric vehicles, Teslaachieved an 80% market share of U.S. sales in the last year. I think this point is perhaps not wellappreciated. All other electric vehicles combined were 20% of sales in the U.S. in last year. So Ithink that's not bad.We also delivered -- also made vehicles last year as we did in all prior years combined, which is atremendous achievement by the Tesla team. The -- if you track Tesla vehicle production year-over-year, cumulative sales deliveries year-over-year, it is about the cleanest exponential I've ever seen.We've basically almost doubled our fleet every year. Every year, we make as many cars as we did inall prior years. So this is a very unusual thing to see for -- especially for a large complexmanufactured object. I think it may be the fastest that a complex manufactured object like a car hasgrown in history, or at least I'm not aware of anything that is faster. Martin, are you -- do you...?Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRI'm not sure."

        "paragraph": "I think Model T was a little bit slower, but I'm not 100% sure.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect Okay. And we expect that exponential to continue. So with the deliveries this year being -- even inthe face of -- if there's a global recession -- even if there's a global recession, we're expectingdeliveries this year to be about 50% higher than last year. And this -- it could be a lot more thanthat. But even with tough economic times, to receive 50% growth is pretty nutty.Over Q4, we achieved GAAP profitability for the second quarter for the first time in the companyhistory, and we increased our cash on hand by more than $700 million, even after paying debt,ending the year with a total of $3.7 billion of cash. This means we have enough cash to settle ourconvertible bond that will mature in March.In addition, our operating margin remains strong at 5.7%. Operating margins in the fourth quarterare usually lower in the automotive industry, but this was not the case for Tesla.2019 is going to be an amazing year for Tesla. As I mentioned, we're expecting to increase sales by50%. Perhaps it could be a lot more than 50%, but I think 50% is a very reasonable number. Butthat's crazy growth for the automotive industry.I want to note that one of our major priorities this quarter is improving service operations. So really,from my standpoint, when I think about what my priorities are this quarter, it's improving service inNorth America. That's #1. And I think there are some very exciting initiatives we're going to rollout with regard to that. We're going to get cars to China and Europe and make sure that we havegood logistics for the whole delivery process, from factory gate to the customer. That's obviouslypretty far from California to get to Europe and China and then get to -- get product to ourcustomers. So we're working every aspect of that logistics chain. And I think we've -- I think it'sgoing to be good.I'd say at this point, I'm optimistic about being profitable in Q1. Not by a lot, but I'm optimisticabout being profitable in Q1 and for all quarters going forward.So let's see, we've opened 27 new store and service locations, bringing our total locationsworldwide to 378. And we increased our Mobile Service fleet to 411 vehicles."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "The Mobile Servicefleet is something we can scale up very rapidly, because we don't need bricks and mortar. We canget more vehicles, hire people and deploy rapidly. It also actually results in higher customersatisfaction, because we can actually send one of our service vans to your work or home and fix thecar without you having to bring it into a service center or do any paperwork or anything like that.It's really seamless, invisible, the customers love it.And we're also increasing the functionality of the Tesla App for service, so that instead of having tomake an appointment, to call and make an appointment, you can just open your Tesla App, say youwant to make a service appointment, and it lists the top 10 most frequently requested service items,and you can, with a couple of taps, you've made your service appointment. And we're going tomake it easier for the car to be picked up and dropped off as well. So if you want -- if you prefer notcoming to the service center at all, you can just request that the car be picked up and delivered.That's something that we'll be -- so that's already been rolled out and have a big improvement tocustomer satisfaction. That rolled out 2 or 3 weeks ago.But the next thing we're going to add is, if your car detects something wrong, like a flat tire or adrive unit failure, that before the car has even come to a halt, there is a tow truck and a serviceloaner on the way. So the car has already notified Tesla emergency services, and a service loaner, atow truck, are on their way before your car has even come to a stop. Now this will be immense inimproving customer happiness. Basically, it'll just call it and you'll have to tap the center screen tocancel it. So you can cancel it if you want. We just have to -- it's like automatically going to happen,you just press cancel.We're also improving product distribution. So I think we made a strategic error in the past about nothaving service parts located at our service centers. We had them in product distribution warehouses,which basically meant it was impossible to have a fast turnaround on servicing a car, because thecar would come in, then the parts will be requested, they come to the service center, this wouldbasically -- even for a very simple repair, could take days."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "So we're going to be able to stock in allcommon parts at the service centers, so that it's possible to -- and first of all, have -- get your carserviced in 20 minutes or 15 minutes, even, if it's a simple matter. I mean, it should be like JiffyLube, like 8 minutes or whatever, not 8 minutes, that's -- it should be like lightning fast. But inorder to do that, we have to have the parts located at our service centers.Also, it's going to make sense for our service centers to do basic body work or essentially, if all youneed to do to is replace a front or rear fascia, it makes sense to just pre-stock the front and rearfascia in the common colors. So unless you have an unusual color, we can literally replace yourfascia in 15, 20 minutes, and there's none of this, like, weeks at a body shop stuff.Let's see, in terms of the new products, with Model Y , we've completed [ensuring] of and design ofModel Y , and the products are -- the tooling that's going out for production of Model Y , 3/4 of theModel Y is common with the Model 3, so it's a much lower CapEx per vehicle than Model 3. Andthe risk is also quite low. This is in contrast to Model S versus Model X, where the theory was -- Ithink Model X, we just -- it's like sort of Model X to be like sort of the Faberg\u00c3\u00a9 egg of cars. It's a-- it's an incredible vehicle and probably one -- probably nothing like it will ever be made again,and maybe it shouldn't. But it is a work of art. It's a special work of art. But the commonality withthe Model S is limited. It was only about maybe 30% in common with the Model S, whereas ModelY is, I think, 76% or something like that, in common with the Model 3. And we're most likely goingto put Model Y production right next to -- in fact, as part of our main Gigafactory in Nevada. So itwill just be right there, batteries and powertrains will come out and go straight into the vehicle. Sothat also reduces our risk of execution and reduces the cost of having to transfer parts fromCalifornia to Nevada."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "It's not a for-sure thing, but it's quite likely, and it's our default plan.I would expect Model Y will probably be -- the demand for Model Y will be maybe 50% higherthan Model 3, could be even double. The -- as I understand it, the mid-sized SUV segment is the,worldwide, is the most popular type of vehicle. So we'll probably see a higher volume of Y than 3.And earlier this month, we started construction of Gigafactory Shanghai, and by the end of thisyear, we expect to be producing Model 3s using a complete vehicle production line. That's body,paint, final assembly, general assembly and module production. So it basically would be -- thisshould be extremely fast. I get like daily updates of progress of the Shanghai Gigafactory, and thosefactories are going to go up like lightning. So we do feel quite confident at this point, at least for thefactories that are in our control, that we can achieve volume production in Shanghai by the end ofthe year. And that should allow us to get to the 10,000 vehicles a week rate, or very close to it, bythe end of the year.And yes, I think that's it."

        "paragraph": "Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay, great. So we're going to take the first questions from our retail investors who have beensubmitting their questions on say.com. So the question that has been submitted has been aboutservice, which I think you already spoke at length about. So let's go to the second question.The second question would be, how are you feeling about demand right now across the productline? Is 500,000 to 700,000 units at $42,000 ASP still a realistic annual target for Model 3, evenconsidering Model Y and its impact on demand? And do you continue to see S and X demand of100,000 annually?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI mean, my best guess, this is just a guess, my best guess for demand of Model 3 worldwide issomething -- in a strong economy, is something on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year.That's my best guess for demand of Model 3 in a strong economy. If the economy goes into arecession, then I think that could be something on the -- 40% less. But I think even in a recession,worldwide demand is still something in the order of 500,000 for Model 3. For S and X, we dideliminate the 75 kilowatt hour version of S and X and to provide more differentiation relative to 3and then Y that's coming out. I think we could see a slight decline in total vehicles, but I think thenet cash flow from S and X is likely to be very similar. So probably no major change in net cashflow for S and X.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The next question from Alex is, can you please share an update on full self-driving and TeslaNetwork development? When will customers start to see full self driving features? What's the bestcase time line for Tesla Network to go live?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectSure. We -- we already have full self-driving capability on highway. So from highway on-ramp tohighway exit, including passing cars and going from one highway interchange to another, full selfdriving capability is there. In a few weeks, we'll be pushing an update that will allow the option ofremoving stalk confirm in markets where regulators approve it, which we believe that will be thecase in the U.S., for example."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "And over time, we think probably all regulators will approve it. Butwe kept stalk confirm there just to make sure that we took care of like -- of any strange corner cases.And it's really quite sublime, if you have stalk confirm off and like the car goes from highway on-ramp, passes slower cars, change -- takes an interchange and then takes the exit and then comes to astop after the exit. So it's really quite profound to have that experience. Then the next part of fullself-driving would really be to -- is traffic lights. So it's hard. So stop streets are pretty easy becauseyou can essentially geocode those and it's easier to recognize stop signs. Traffic lights andintersections will be the next really tricky one. And then navigating complex parking lots and like --so like if you're underground in a mall parking lot with a lot of traffic and pedestrians and it's onmultiple levels, that kind of thing is what gets tricky. With the release of enhanced or advancedSummon, you'll see the first indications of the car being able to navigate complex parking lots, andthat's also coming out fairly soon, probably next month. And in development mode, the car does allof the things that I just mentioned in development mode. It recognizes traffic lights and stop signsand basically has all the functionality in development mode. It's really just a question of getting thereliability of recognizing traffic lights to several 9s, like -- so maybe it's like, I don't know, 98%good right now, but we need it to be like 99.999%, really extremely reliable. So in a nutshell, whenthe capability will be there for -- when will we think it's safe for full self-driving, it's probablytowards the end of this year, and then it's up to regulators to decide when they want to approve that.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Let's go to the next question, which is, if and when will Tesla switch Model S and X to 2170battery cells? What percent range improvement do you expect?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectWe have no plans to switch S and X to 2170 and can't comment on future product developments.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay."

        "paragraph": "So maybe we'll take the last question from retail investors, which was, where will Tesla Semiand Model Y be produced? Can you share a time line on expected production ramp of theseproducts?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI was mentioning earlier, the Model Y , we think, most likely will be produced at Gigafactory, butthat's -- unless we encounter some obstacle -- that's the default plan that we're proceeding towards.And it's fast, lower risk and relatively low CapEx. In terms of the -- I mean, probably there's likeinitial production of Model Y , very low volume, early next year. But then it always takes time toramp up any production system, and it's difficult to predict the shape of that S-curve. So we feelconfident in saying there will be production volume of Model Y by the end of next year. But inbetween beginning of next year with low volume, it always starts with very low, and then it growsexponentially, from beginning of last year to end of next year, it's difficult to predict that ramp. Sothat's our expectation for Y . For Semi, we're -- I don't know if you want to comment on that,Jerome?Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionGoing to start next year as well.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes.Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionBut the first units will be -- this is Jerome -- well, first units will be for our own usage. So dependshow many trucks we'll use for our own usage to move the parts and the vehicles to differentlocations, and then we'll start delivering to outside customers.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, sounds good. And then the Tesla pickup truck, we might be ready to unveil that this summer. Itwill be something quite unique, unlike anything else.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay, fantastic. So operator, we can start taking questions from participants on the call."

        "paragraph": "Our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research AnalystI see in the letter the amount that you have spent on land for Gigafactory Shanghai in theclassification operating cash flows. Is there any guidance you can provide us in terms of how tothink about CapEx for this facility going forward? And can you discuss the source of funds for theproject? I think you've spoken in the past about the potential to raise debt locally in China. Is thatstill your thinking? And what kind of terms might you be able to raise that capital?Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOYes, Deepak here. You're right. The purchase of the land is a 50-year lease with the government ofChina. So it's not CapEx, but it's operating lease that shows up as cash flow from operations.However, the CapEx that we will invest is our equipment, and we fully own it. So that will show upas capital expenditures. The plan, as we have indicated in the letter, is still to get funding for amajority of debt capital spending from local China banks. And we expect pretty attractive ratesbased on the dialogue we've had. And there's a lot of interest. And we hope to finalize that and thenshare the details at that point.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, I mean, as a ballpark figure, probably it's something about -- something in the order of $0.5billion in CapEx to get to the 3,000 vehicle rate in Shanghai, ballpark figure. And as Deepak wassaying, we've been offered very competitive debt financing in China, really extremely compellinginterest rates, so we do not expect that to be a capital drain on the company.Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOYes, these are the biggest banks in the world, and for them, $500 million is not a large amount ofmoney in the scheme of things."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectOne thing is -- sorry, I just wanted to -- something that's perhaps, if you're in the automotiveindustry, you'll understand how significant this is, but maybe it's not as obvious to everyone, isTesla has the first wholly-owned manufacturing facility in China for any -- of any automotivecompany. So this is profound, and we're very appreciative of the Chinese government allowing usto do this. I think it is symbolic of them wanting to open the market and apply fair rules foreveryone, and I want to extend, like, a note of appreciation for the Chinese government in allowingus to do that. It's a very significant thing.Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-Founder & Head ofResearchThis question I have is relative to Waymo and the autonomous driving opportunity. Morgan Stanleyrecently valued Waymo at $175 billion. And my question is, what do they have that you don't have?And separately -- so what do they have that you don't have, and then separately, how important isautonomy to the Tesla story longer term? Is this nice to have? Is it really about EVs and renewableenergy? Or is the autonomy kind of one of the foundational parts of the story longer term?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectTo find out the goodness of Tesla, so like sort of the why of Tesla, the relevance, what's the point ofTesla, comes down to 2 things: acceleration of sustainable energy and autonomy. The accelerationof sustainable energy is absolutely fundamental because this is the next potential risk for humanity.So obviously, that is, by far and away, the most important thing. But also, very important isautonomy. This has the potential to save millions of lives, tens of millions of serious highwayinjuries and give people their time back so that they don't have to drive, they can -- if you're on theroad, you can spend time doing things that you enjoy instead of being in terrible traffic. So it'sextremely important."

        "paragraph": "We feel confident about our technical strategy, and I think we have anadvantage that no one else has, which is that we have, at this point, somewhere in the order of300,000 vehicles on the road, with a 360-degree camera sensor suite, radar, ultrasonics, alwaysconnected, uploads, especially video clips with [customer information], when there's anintervention. So effectively, we have a massive, massive training fleet. Our -- the miles of trainingthat we have, if you added everyone else up combined, they're probably 5%, I'm being generous, ofthe miles that Tesla has. And this difference is increasing. A year from now, we'll probably go -- andif you go, certainly, if you go 18 months from now, we'll probably have 1 million vehicles on theroad with -- and every time the customers drive the car, they're training the systems to be better. I'mjust not sure how anyone competes with that."

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectWell, I think we did, actually. Yes, it's clear in our letter.Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOCorrect. We indicated in Q1, we will start delivering Model 3s in Europe and China. And we alsoshared a chart showing the potential market size for mid-sized premium sedans in North America,Europe and Asia, suggesting those markets can be even bigger. So I think that gives a good sense ofwhere we'll be. And we'll launch the right-hand drive version at some point to go to the othermarkets.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, it's maybe on the order of 350,000 to 500,000 Model 3s, something like that this year.Colin William Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior AnalystOkay. And then just in terms of the cost reduction road map and rework, post-factory, can you talk alittle bit about your expectation for reducing that in the next couple of quarters and what the orderof magnitude is on that in your model internally?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectJerome, do you want to answer that?Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionThis is Jerome. Well, our manufacturing keeps improving quarter-over-quarter, actually, week-over-week. We take fewer hours, both here in Fremont or at the Gigafactory, to assemble the Model 3and S and X as well. And then we track the quality very closely. We review that carefully with theengineers and the supply chain and the manufacturing teams. And the quality in the field and thenumber of incidents is also improving week-over-week, every week. So there are fewer and fewerneed for cars to be in service, yes. So we'll keep going. There's no end in sight. And we'll try tomake sure that the car never breaks down.Elon R.

I mean, any color on what price you're expecting that to be? Because I think there'sa lot of chatter that demand is already weak in -- of the midrange, at least, already in January. I don'tknow if that's true as well.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, I mean, the -- it's more like there are multiple factors at play here. First of all, there's a lot ofseasonality to automotive purchases. Most people do not buy a new car in the middle of a blizzard.So January and February tend to be seasonally low and then it picks up significantly around theearly to mid-March time frame. In the U.S., we obviously have a pull forward of demand from thetax credit. And yes, there's -- so there's those factors. But I feel very confident about Model 3demand.

What are your latest thoughts in terms oftiming of introduction? I think at some point, you had in mind to do it in the -- maybe the first halfof this year. And just to clarify, when you're sort of talking about the outlook for 2019, the numberof deliveries up 50% and then the margin target for Model 3 to get to 25%, does that assume thatyou're introducing a lower range, the short-range Model 3 at some point during the year?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectWell, we call it the standard range, but it's maybe short by Tesla's standards, but it's long range byother manufacturers' standards. So -- but yes, we expect to introduce the standard range Model 3sometime, probably the middle of this year is a rough -- rough guess. And we're working hard toimprove our costs of production, our overhead costs, our fixed costs, just costs in general. I thinkthis past year, while extremely difficult, has driven us to a high level of financial discipline. I thinkwe're way smarter about how we spend money, and we're getting better with each passing week.Yes.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystAnd so to be clear, the -- you expect to reach at some point this year, or you're targeting at somepoint this year, 25% gross margin on Model 3, and that's despite introducing the lower-end, or Iguess, the standard range Model 3. Is that correct?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystOkay. And I guess, my follow-up would be on the demand side. So you're talking about 50%increase this year. You said a few times that it could be higher than this. I think you just mentionedin the previous question 350,000 to 500,000, if I understood well. So what is sort of like what drivesthe cautious outlook that's in your letter? Because it feels like it's the -- it's just basically 4x thefourth quarter run rate, which would imply sort of 50% for the full year, but not really a lot ofgrowth versus what you just accomplished."

        "paragraph": "So I guess, how do we think about the total demand for2019, especially if you introduce this -- the cheaper version?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectWell, we need to bring the Shanghai factory online. I think that's the biggest variable for getting to500k-plus a year. Our car is just very expensive going into China. We've got import duties. We'vegot transport costs. We've got higher-cost labor here. And we've never been eligible for any of theEV tax credits. A lot of people (inaudible) being so dependent on incentives. In fact, we are, for acompany making EVs, we have the least access to incentives. It's pretty crazy, because there's somany companies that, that -- countries that have put price caps on the EV incentive, whichdifferentially affect Tesla. And in China, which is the biggest market for EVs, we've never had anysubsidies or tax incentives for vehicles. So it's difficult. Once a car is made there, it is eligible forthat. But it sounds like that's going to be reducing in China in the coming years. But really, bottomline is, we need the Shanghai factory to achieve that 10k rate and have the cars be affordable. Thedemand for -- it's important to appreciate, the demand for Model 3 is insanely high. The inhibitor isaffordability. It's just like people literally don't have the money to buy the car. It's got nothing to dowith desire. They just don't have enough money in their bank account. If the car can be made moreaffordable, the demand is extraordinary."

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureSo Deepak, I was wondering, so as you get to 2019, we're all concerned about a potential recession,and I was wondering how you think about it and what you would tell us about what we shouldexpect -- how we should expect Tesla to react to a recession in 2019. How do you manage yourvolume [LAM]? How do you manage your pricing? How do you possess cash? How do youmanage your CapEx if things turn south in 2019? And then I have a follow-up on gross margin forJerome.Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOYes, it's a very broad question, which is not really just for me to answer. But I think at the highestlevel, the way we are trying to be prepared for any kind of contingency is to just continue focusingon cost. And the theme of our conversations here is, how do we reduce cost all the time? And howdo we run our business with a very high level of financial discipline? And Elon alluded to that andso did Jerome, I think. That if we do that, we believe that even in some of the scenarios of lowervolumes and pricing, tight pricing, we do have a good chance and a good shot of being profitableand generate free cash flow. So that's the best way to manage the business, be frugal.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, I don't want to be a broken record about this, it's costs, costs, costs, cost, because reducing ourcosts -- by the way, while making modest improvements to Model 3, I want to emphasize, theproduct is getting better by slight degrees despite lower cost, in hundreds of small ways, that youactually wouldn't -- most people wouldn't notice explicitly, but they would appreciatesubconsciously. And getting those costs down, variable costs and fixed costs, is what allows us tolower the price and be financially sustainable and achieve our mission of environmentalsustainability. So we have to be absolute zealots about this, there's no question.Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOThe other aspect of this, Elon, which we've been doing extremely well, is capital efficiency."

We talk about it for Model Y .There are just so many learnings that we are incorporating. And we just want to beat what we didwith Model 3 and the kind of spending we had for the returns we got.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectAbsolutely. I mean, like, we're confident that our CapEx per unit of production for Shanghai factoryand for Model Y will be less than half of what we did for Model 3. Internally, we think it might be aquarter, but that's probably too good to believe, but it's definitely less than half."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.David J. Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity AnalystFirst thing I want to just understand is on what you're seeing from European orders and Chinaorders so far. There are some numbers that get thrown around, but you guys are obviously taking alook at it. How is that order profile shaping up relative to what you saw in the U.S. with the launchof the 3?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI think it seems good. I mean, our issue actually with Europe and China is how do we get the carsmade and on a boat as such that it reaches customers before end of quarter and we don't have amassive number of cars on the water. That's our biggest challenge. It's not demand. It's how do weget the cars there fast enough.David J. Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity AnalystSo like orders above, I think I've seen like 20,000 order levels for Europe and single-digit thousandsfor China, it's better than that, Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, absolutely. The -- I mean, we're not even really trying, I should point out. I guess, it's -- we --our factory is like, right now, only making cars for China and Europe. That's all it's doing for -- withrespect to Model 3. And our whole focus is, okay, how do we get those cars made, get them on aship as fast as possible, get the ship as fast as possible to Zeebrugge in Belgium, then get them overto Drammen in Norway and get those cars to customers as fast as possible. We get them to China asfast as possible. And China, we're also -- yes, we don't what's going to happen with the tradenegotiations. So it's very important to get those cars, especially to China, as soon as possible. Wehope the trade negotiations go well, but it's not clear. But we need to get them there while there'ssort of a de facto -- sort of a truce on the tariff war. And the demand gen is really not one of thethings we're thinking about.David J. Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division - Equity AnalystOkay. Then just lastly on this demand thread, customer deposits came in again over $100 million."

        "paragraph": "Isit possible to give us an update? I know you don't think it's really a relevant number, but I do and I'llexplain why. On the reservation count, where you were at 450,000, you started delivering. And Iask this because I think we're just all trying to understand how much incremental demand you thinkthere is based on what you see at that lower price point if, say, there's over half of those people thatare still waiting for that 75k base model to come out. That would be interesting, and I think that'swhat you're seeing, but I just want to confirm that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectSo Deepak, do you want to...?Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOYes, I mean, I think reservations are not relevant for us. We are really focused on orders. Now wedo have a large reservations backlog still, which tells us that a lot of customers are still waiting forthose cars, but I don't think it's appropriate to share the reservations number.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectReservations are just like preorders. It's like you have like some video game come out and it's like apreorder number, then that's like -- stops being important once you start shipping the game orproduct. So yes, as I said earlier, I think -- my guess is demand is somewhere on the order -- in astrong economy, is on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year for Model 3 and even in arecession is probably on the order of 0.5 million."

Obviously, with deliveries coming onboard in the first quarter,maybe what surprised you in terms of -- demand looks strong, but in terms of what you're seeingout of the region, is it stronger than you expected in certain countries? What do you think is drivingthat? And maybe you can just talk about the opportunities and challenges in Europe, especiallyfrom a delivery logistics perspective.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectWell, like I said, we're thinking about demand almost 0 right now. It's really getting the productthere in time and not having a ton of cars on the water end of the quarter and then for China, gettingcars there before there's a potential rise in tariffs. That's really -- put really at front of mind, that costreduction and then improving service in North America, yes.Daniel Harlan Ives - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division - MD of Equity ResearchAnd just maybe a quick follow-up. Can you just talk about, when we look at the Gigafactory build-out in China and obviously how important that is, maybe just fast forward, let's say, 18, 24 months,I mean, how do you envision that as just a competitive advantage versus maybe some otherautomakers that will be trying to go in your tracks?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI think it will be quite a significant advantage. I really view it as quite fundamental to the future ofTesla, and I expect to make several trips to China this year. And I'm working very closely with theteam building the factory. I literally get daily updates. So it's a super big deal and we're only justtalking about Phase 1 here. Phase 1 is about 10% of what we think the Gigafactory will ultimatelybe. So it's a major, major, major deal. And we're getting a lot of support from the Shanghaigovernment, which we're very appreciative of, and the national government."

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystYou've talked repeatedly about the need to drive down costs, which in turn drives elasticity ofdemand for cars. And I'm wondering if you can talk about how much of the price differentialbetween the $50,000 Model 3 and the $35,000 Model 3 is structural, meaning that powertrain costsfor EVs are just structurally higher than they are for internal combustion engine cars? And whereyou think that difference is today and when that is no longer a factor? So is -- or maybe said anotherway, is the bigger driver in getting to lower costs and lower -- and more affordability on the Model3, is it really around the powertrain and getting that at parity? Or is it everything else about Teslanot being as efficient as other manufacturers that is causing the higher price right now? And have Ifollow-up, please.Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionIt's both, it's both the vehicle and both the powertrain. So I split my time half and half between theGigafactory and here, and there is opportunities in both, yes.Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOBut I think the bigger point is that, yes, there is cost reduction opportunities out, but the biggerpoint is not that our cost is higher than a gas-powered or an internal combustion engine.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRI think what Toni meant is with a battery pack, as in battery pack as well as the powertrain together,are more expensive than an engine.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectThat's true.A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystAnd how big do you think that delta is today? And when it's -- do you think of it as being kind of$10,000, $11,000 for that pack plus powertrain for an electric vehicle and maybe $5,000 or $6,000for an internal combustion engine car? And is that sort of the order of magnitude? And where doyou see those getting much more aligned, just sort of given the laws of where you think cell andpack costs are going?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc."

        "paragraph": "- Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectWell, the biggest part to bear in mind is the cost of electricity is quite a bit less than the cost ofgasoline, especially in Europe or in California or China, basically almost everywhere except, say,the middle of the United States, the cost of gasoline is very expensive and electricity is far cheaper.The -- so that factors into the cost of ownership pretty significantly. It's on -- sort of on the order of$50 to $100 a month, depending upon how much somebody drives. So that's a very important thingto consider for an electric car versus a gasoline car. The -- that said, in terms of initial cost ofacquisition, I think it's probably -- this is just off the top of my head, not a calculated number,probably on the order of 7k, but trending towards 4k or 5k. Just off the top of my head.A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystOkay. And as you think about 2019, you talked about sort of scenarios for demand and how youplan to roll out the intermediate range and then ultimately the standard range. What is -- if you dohave to make a trade-off on volume or profitability during the course of the year, meaning to get thevolume you need or you think you can deliver, you have to go to lower margins or vice versa,where's the trade-off? Is -- are units produced most important to you? Or is delivering the 25%gross margin more important? So if you have a chance to deliver 450,000 or 500,000 cars, butthey'll be more standard editions and gross margins will end the year at 20%, is that -- are youwilling to make that trade-off?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, my guess is it ends up being sort of about the six in one, half dozen the other, where if there's agiven amount of free cash flow, you sort of decide -- you decide to achieve that with a smallerproduction or smaller volume of cars at a higher margin or large volume cars at a smaller margin. Ithink we're already towards the second. We're going to make more cars at a lower margin, but Ithink it's more or less a flat rate."

And canyou talk about what percentage of S and X have historically been leased in the U.S.?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectWell, we've been reluctant to introduce the leasing on Model 3 because of how -- of its effect onGAAP financials. So it is worth noting that demand to date is with 0 leasing. So obviously, leasingis a way to improve demand, but it has -- it makes our financials looks worse. So we're like -- we'renot wanting to introduce that right away. I mean, we'll introduce it sometime later this yearprobably. What -- I'm not sure the percentage of lease is for S and X right now.Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOIt's around 20%, low 20s, and it stayed stable at that level for many, many quarters, which is -- itseems like the natural demand because we don't do subvention or artificially bump up...Elon R.

The -- it usually affects small business tax write-off, is importantfor the -- for leasing, so.Daniel V . Galves - Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research & Senior AnalystOkay.

And then just the last one is...Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOSorry, go ahead.Daniel V . Galves - Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research & Senior AnalystYes, the last one is, this change in your service parts structure to make things more distributedrather than in the parts warehouses, would that be like a meaningful working capital drag?

Right now --actually, our costs will improve, I think, actually quite a lot, because there's been actually quite --the current system is quite boneheaded, actually, speaking self-referentially. So just being -- sostopping doing the foolish things will massively improve our service costs, will massively improvecustomer happiness around the world, and it's just fundamentally better all around.

Talk to us about that if you can. Number two, Elon, couldyou talk to us about -- can you talk about -- I hear you cut some workforce at SpaceX and there atTesla and I feel that you have a worry about global economy. Can you talk to us about how you feelabout that with your guidance in order -- in the same order?

So I mean,we're excited about it, but I can't say much more detail.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI mean, our internal projections for stationary storage are closer to 3 gigawatt hours.
