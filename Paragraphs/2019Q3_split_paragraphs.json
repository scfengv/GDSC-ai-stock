        "paragraph": "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Tesla's Q3 2019 Financial Resultsand Q&A Webcast. Please be advised that today's conference is beingrecorded. I would now like to hand the conference to over your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Directorof Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherrine. And good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2019 Q&AWebcast.I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q3 resultswere announced at about 2 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link asthis webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. First of all, I'd like to just thank the Tesla team for an incredible job this quarter. Theexecution was outstanding and on just about every front. So it's just an honor to work with such agreat team.Q4 -- Q3 was obviously a very strong quarter. And we had record deliveries. We're able to makegreat strides in controlling our costs. We shifted back to GAAP profitability while also generatingstrong free cash flow. And again, this would not be possible without each employee doing their partto reduce cost. Our operating cost is now at the lowest level since Model 3 production started.Regarding Gigafactory Shanghai, this month, we started trial production at Giga Shanghai in bothvehicles from body to paint to general assembly. So this is a -- I want to emphasize, this is a realfactory with a tremendous amount of equipment in it. While a lot of people see the outside shell ofthe factory, which is enormous and it was essentially underwater in January, it was just below thewater table literally, what is, I think, much more significant is that we're able to install massivestamping machines, a fully operational paint shop and a sophisticated general assembly line in thesame period of time in parallel with building the building. I'd like to thank our entire team for this extraordinary achievement."

        "paragraph": "I'm not aware of any factory ofthis magnitude in history being constructed in such a short period of time, approximately 10months. As far as I know, this is unprecedented. And Gigafactory Shanghai will become a templatefor future growth. We're planning to build Model Ys in Shanghai as well, of course, and build aGigafactory in Europe. And we hope to announce the location of that Gigafactory -- in fact, we willannounce the location of that Gigafactory before the end of this year.Regarding Model Y , we're also ahead of schedule on Model Y preparations in Fremont. And we'vemoved the launch time line from fall 2020 to summer 2020. There may be some room forimprovement there, but we're confident about summer 2020.I've actually recently driven the Model Y Release Candidate, and I think it's going to an amazingproduct and be very well received. I think it's quite likely to -- it's just my opinion, but I think it willoutsell S, X and 3 combined.Regarding Version 10 and Smart Summon, last month, we released our latest software, Version 10,which includes video streaming, games, karaoke, Spotify and a host of other new features andimprovements. Most importantly, it includes the first version of Smart Summon, which has nowbeen used 1 million times. So it's now over 1 million users of Smart Summon. And we're -- in thenext week or so, we will be releasing an improved version of Smart Summon, taking into accountall the data from those 1 million Smart Summon attempts.So this really illustrates the value of having a massive fleet because it allows us to collect thesecorner cases and learn from them and use fleet learning and become rapidly better, just as Navigateon Autopilot did on the freeway. So expect a number of improvements in Smart Summon in theweeks to come. And this really is just the beginning as we collect more data and Autopilot and FullSelf-Driving functionality gets better.I do -- while it's going to be tight, it still does appear that we will be at least in limited -- in earlyaccess release of a feature-complete Full Self-Driving future this year. So it's not for sure, but itappears to be on track for at least the early access release of a fully functional Full Self-Driving bythe end of this year.And yes, lastly, we're highly focused on decisions that really make a material difference to thecompany such as opening Gigafactories in other continents."

        "paragraph": "Yes, it's worth noting that these --ultimately, having 3 Gigafactories, effectively, we'll actually triple our output. And then when youconsider increased output per Gigafactory, it's going to actually more than triple our output overtime.And then there are a lot of interesting things happening with respect to advanced batteries and moreefficient powertrains and Full Self-Driving, all that sort of stuff. But that will be something for afuture time.And then one last item is that tomorrow afternoon, we will be releasing version 3 of the Tesla SolarRoof. That's the integrated solar -- with solar panels integrated with the roof. So that's -- I think thisis a great product. Version 1 and 2, we're still sort of figuring things out. Version 3, I think, is finallyready for the big time. And so we're scaling up production of the version 3 solar tower roof at ourBuffalo Gigafactory. And I think this product is going to be incredible. But we'll talk more aboutthat on the official product launch, which will be tomorrow afternoon.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And I think Zachary has some remarks as well.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thank you, Elon. Thank you, Martin. Q3 was a great quarter for Tesla. I know manyemployees are listening right now, and I want to thank you for your passion and your hard work.We've made terrific progress, and yet again, we realized margin improvement in nearly every aspectof the business.There are 3 key points I'd like to highlight. First, we returned to profitability in Q3, aided byimproved gross profit, reduced operating expenses in the absence of negative onetime items thatweighed on our financials in the first half of the year. GAAP automotive gross margin improvedsequentially to 22.8% and over 20% excluding regulatory credits.We achieved these improvements through higher production volumes on S/X and Model 3, enablingbetter fixed cost absorption. We realized improvements in labor hours per vehicle as well as othercosts such as warehousing, logistics, delivery and import-related items. We're also makingcontinued progress reducing material costs, including commercial negotiations with suppliers.Model S and X ASPs increased even accounting for revenue deferrals related to free unlimitedsupercharging. And Model 3 ASPs declined slightly driven by mix in Asia, pricing action inEMEA."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "North American ASPs held flat as mix improved, offsetting pricing action we took at thestart of the quarter, which is great to see.Note that with the release of Smart Summon in the U.S., we were able to recognize $30 million ofdeferred revenue. As we expand Smart Summon to additional markets and release new features,we'll continue to recognize additional deferred revenue.Our services and other loss reduced yet again, reflecting our focus to improve the efficiency of thisarea of the business. And we further reduced operating expenses despite increased orders, deliveriesand new programs in development.And finally, on net income -- in other income, we saw benefits from foreign exchange which, as Imentioned last quarter, we don't hedge.The second key point I want to highlight is that we demonstrated another quarter of strong free cashflows despite a significant increase in our captive leasing mix and a sequential increase in CapExspend. This has enabled year-to-date positive free cash flows for the company. Our cash balanceincreased by approximately the same amount as our free cash flows, and we exited the quarter withour highest quarter ending cash balance ever of just over $5.3 billion.Specifically, on captive leases, we received a number of questions on how these are funded. We useour leasing warehouse and ABS sales to allow for captive leases without material use of cash.What's important to note here is that our warehouse and ABS flow through financing cash flow and,as a result, leases negatively impact free cash flow. This impact was material in Q3 as the lease rateincreased substantially by 50%.In addition, CapEx spend increased driven primarily by Gigafactory Shanghai and Model Yspending. We received a number of questions on why our capital spending appears low compared toprior levels even though there are multiple new projects launching and in development. As wenoted in the shareholder letter this quarter and last quarter, this is because we've made greatprogress on improving our capital efficiency.My third and final point is around demand and growth. Our global order rate remains strong andcontinues to increase. Despite increases to production levels, our order backlog has been growing.And quarter-to-date orders are significantly higher than at this point in last quarter.In the immediate term, we're focused on increasing production of Model 3 and Model S and X asquickly as we can. The bulk of this work involves continued optimization of existing equipment.We've also made targeted adjustments to pricing to better balance supply and demand."

        "paragraph": "Our pace ofexecution on these factories and capacity expansion has increased significantly. As Elon mentioned,the first phase of Gigafactory Shanghai is already production-ready, and we've been able to pull inthe time line for other major projects.Overall, we are quickly turning the corner for our next phase of growth, and our financial healthcontinues to strengthen. We remain focused on reducing cost, which enables rapid investments infuture programs and growth.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, and I think also, our Senior Director of Energy Operations, Kunal Girotra,wanted to add some remarks.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsHi, everyone. My name is Kunal Girotra, and I've been with Tesla for about 4 years, working ondifferent aspects of deploying our energy products. I now run Tesla Energy's deployment andfulfillment teams.Over the last 3 months, the energy teams have made great progress in both our solar and energystorage businesses. As you can see in our quarterly deck, our solar deployments rose by almost 50%over the last quarter. And our energy storage deployment, which includes Powerwalls andPowerpacks, grew by 15% to an all-time high of 477 megawatt hours.In the last 3 months, we relaunched Tesla solar in North America by simplifying our solar offeringinto 3 sizes of small, medium and large. We're transferring pricing on the website.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorActually, if I may interject a minute, but what a lot of people don't realize is in -- like in Californiaand in a number of other states, if you buy our sort of solar subscription or solar rental, there's nomoney down and you instantly save on your utility bill and there's no long-term contract. So it'skind of a no-brainer. It's really do you want something that prints money? And if it doesn't printmoney, we'll fix it or take it back. It's kind of a no-brainer. And it sort of plays into Tesla'soverarching strategy here, which is effectively to become like a giant distributed global utility onthe energy front.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsYes, absolutely. The subscription solar offering that you mentioned was launched in 6 states. Andlike you said, it's fixed monthly payments and no long-term contracts. And the response fromcustomers have been pretty awesome.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc."

    {
        "paragraph": "- Founder, CEO & DirectorMost people do actually buy it as opposed to rent it, which is actually technically the better -- whileyou make money is immediately if you're rental, it's actually a better investment if you buy itbecause the cost of capital of the consumer is better than our cost of capital.And then there was like an interesting study by Zillow and a number of other organizations thatshow that adding solar to your home increases the price of -- increases the value of your home. Andthe Zillow study showed a 4% increase in the value of the home with solar. And then if you add sortof the Powerwall, which gives you blackout protection, so you will have energy security in an eventof rolling blackouts or if the power goes up for any reason, which appears to be a long-termsystemic issue in California particularly, that I think this definitely can be viewed as a significantasset for any home.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsTotally, yes. Yes, I think to your point of buying Tesla solar is easy because we have one of thelowest prices in the nation now -- in the country. And just a little bit of a story there, we were ableto lower our prices because our cost of acquisition is now less than 1/4 of any typical solarcompany.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWe don't do sales.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsYes. These are online sales, online orders.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThere's no advertising, no marketing and no sales force. But would you rather pay for power or formarketing? Yes. I'd say you'd rather pay for the product.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsTotally, yes, yes. All right, that's great. On solar, we want to simplify the fulfillment process with agoal of really fast order-to-install time lines. We've done many residential installs with a single visitto a customer's home because the standard sizes are reduced complexity. We've also been workingwith cities and counties to submit generic permits that follow a template rather than customizing forevery situation because...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Actually, Kunal, this is a really big deal. That's like the ones people won't appreciate."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "It's greatwork by you and the energy team to get those signed because one of the inhibitors, both from a costand timing standpoint, is getting permit approval from the various regional authorities of -- andwe've pioneered a novel approach. It's sort of an innovation applied to bureaucracy, frankly, which -- interfacing your client innovation to try anything. And every button -- a massive number ofhousing approval authorities to take a generic template as opposed to a custom template, whichmakes it (inaudible) and in most cases, I think electronic as well. So that just makes it simple andlow cost and fast to get approval for solar, which is how it should be.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsTotally. Yes, around 350 cities and counties have accepted it. There is still about...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorAnd more coming.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsMany more coming.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think ultimately, it will be almost everyone.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsYes, yes. We have a lot more small cities and counties that have to come online, but that will be ourfocus in the coming days. And it's more important as we scale Solar Roof 2 for all our -- deployingenergy products needs innovation and in the bureaucracy space, as you said as well.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, yes.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsYes. So all these improvements have led us to speed up our customer order-to-installation time linesfrom months to, in many cases, days. As, Elon, you already said, we've added the option to addPowerwalls to secure people from future power outages. And a home with solar and Powerwall, aswas shown in the recent California outages, many homes ran successfully.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. You can tell which homes have Powerwall because that's where all the light -- that's where thelights are on. Yes, if you look at the neighborhood, it's like oh, there's -- everywhere but a few lightsaround and those are usually the ones with the Tesla Powerwall. I think -- I don't -- I'm not sure ifyou're going to mention, but also like the single truck roll. It's like\u00e2\u00a6Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc."

        "paragraph": "- Senior Director of Energy OperationsSingle site visit, yes. Single-visit install.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Single-visit install is a big deal. We're taking it from where the solar industry would often be 3visits before the solar was installed and would often take quite a long time to do the installation. Butwe streamlined all of that to a point where, in many cases, it's a single visit to do everything, and it'sfast. So it's like minimize disruptions to the homeowner. And ordering solar is literally 1 click. Youcan order solar for your house in less than 1 minute. So...Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsYes. And then we've done the same thing in the commercial solar space. Nobody thought of puttinga simple website with order -- with prices for commercial solar. We do that now. And we've seen agood response from small businesses wanting to go solar. And by removing the complexity of long-term contracts and simplifying the terms and conditions, the commercial solar sales process wouldtypically take 6 months is now taking a couple of weeks. So the same thing that we've done inresidential, we want to expand more and more in commercial as well.So all in all, the road map for energy products from solar, Solar Roof, Powerwall to Megapack issuper exciting. And I expect Tesla Energy to become a larger part of our overall ecosystem as weleverage and integrate the same competencies from our vehicle business. The future is prettyexciting for Tesla Energy.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorGreat.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsThanks again.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. So first, we're going to take some questions from say.com. We will, thistime, take questions from both institutional investors as well as retail investors."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRSo the first question from institutional investors is, what are the opportunities for Tesla to createdemand? Is word-of-mouth still sufficient? Or should we expect to see Tesla commence advertisingin the near future?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. What we're seeing is that word-of-mouth is more than enough to drive our demand in excess ofproduction. We have no plans to advertise at this time. Obviously, at some point in the future, wemay do advertising, not in the traditional sense but more to just inform people and make sure thatthey are aware of the product, but not engage in the typical trickery that is commonplace inadvertising.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The next question from institutional investors. Elon, other than robotaxis and autonomousvehicle capabilities, when you look over the next 3 years, what are you most excited about at Teslathat you believe investors don't understand or have missed?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI think there's generally a lack of understanding or appreciation for the growth of Tesla Energy, asKunal was talking about. In the long term, I expect Tesla Energy to be of the same -- roughly thesame size as Tesla's automotive sector or business.This is the most underappreciated. I think it could be bigger, but it's certainly of a similarmagnitude, Tesla solar, meaning Tesla solar plus battery stuff is -- to Tesla Energy is, I think, theleast appreciated element. And part of it is like for -- I don't know, for about 18 months, almost 2years, we had to divert a tremendous amount of resources -- well, we had to basically take resourcesfrom everywhere else in the company and apply them to the Model 3 production, fixing the Model 3production ramp and simplifying the design of Model 3.So for about 1.5 years, we unfortunately stripped Tesla Energy of engineering and other resourcesand even took the cell production lines that were meant for Powerwall and Powerpack andredirected them to the car because we didn't have enough cells. Now that we feel that Model 3production is in a good place and headed to a great place, we've restored resources to Tesla solarand storage."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "And so that's going to be, I think, the really crazy growth for as far as future as I canimagine.But we had to do it because if we didn't solve Model 3, Tesla wouldn't survive. So unfortunately,that shorted pretty much the other parts of the company. But it would be difficult for me to overstatethe degree to which I think Tesla Energy is going to be a major part of Tesla's activity in the future.And, I mean, Tesla's mission from the beginning has been to accelerate the advent of sustainableenergy. That means sustainable energy generation and sustainable energy consumption in the formof vehicles, electric vehicles. And I think one of the stats we'll publish in the future along with ourvehicle production is that how much sustainable energy Tesla produced or Tesla customersproduced with our products. And I think you'll see that we're producing about the same orcomparable amounts of sustainable energy as are consumed in the car -- in our cars. Because for thelongest time, the rebuttal against electric cars are like oh, don't they use dirty power from coal?Well, no, we're solar-powered. And that's -- obviously, there are solar power companies, not justTesla. But you have to sell sustainable generation and sustainable consumption, and that's whatwe're doing, and we'll do more of it.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Thank you. The next question from investor is related to Full Self-Driving attach rates. Giventhat self-driving regulations will evolve unevenly in different markets, would you consider sellingmodules individually, for example, Navigating on Autopilot or Summon versus current strategy ofselling the package as a whole in order to encourage adoption and getting more data?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we'll continue to sell it in a bundled fashion. I mean, any Tesla that you buy already hasbasic Autopilot included. So I think that really is a pretty major advantage relative to other cars.And then the next step will be Full Self-Driving with Smart Summon being kind of the beginning ofthat.And obviously, we kind of have the 2 sides of it with highway Autopilot and we've got theSummon, which is sort of low speed and talking less, that kind of thing. Now we need to -- we'reworking on solving that intermediate portion, which is traffic lights and stop signs and navigatingthrough windy roads and -- windy, narrow roads and suburban neighborhoods."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "That's the focus rightnow. And you're going to want it all, right? I think it's -- yes, it's something that everyone's going towant, for sure.And as I said before, the point at which we're able to upload the software enabling a Tesla tobecome a robotaxi, expect to have that from a functionality standpoint by the end of next year. Butin terms of the functionality -- so basic functionality is aspirationally end of this year, but reliableenough that you do not need to pay attention, in our opinion, by the end of next year. And we wouldneed -- the acceptance by regulatory authorities will vary by jurisdiction. That transition, that sort offlipping of the switch from a car that is from not robotaxi to robotaxi, I think will probably be thebiggest step-change increase in asset value in history by far.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Thank you. The next question is with respect to Model Y , what is your latest expectations forlaunch timing? Do you anticipate any Model 3 production downtime at Fremont during the launch?And how should Model Y gross margin percent look compared to Model 3 gross margin?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we've talked about the launch timing. What really matters is the timing to volume production,where volume production is some number in excess of 1,000 units per week. And we're confident ofreaching that point no later than the middle of 2020.The -- yes, so from an interference standpoint, we do not expect it to interfere. Yes. The body line isseparate. The paint line is. So basically, we do not expect it to interfere with Model 3. We do notexpect any downtime. From a margin standpoint, Zach, do you want to...Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. From a margin perspective, we're expecting ASPs for Model Y to be slightly higher than theyare for Model 3. And this is common in the industry between sedans and CUVs. The part that we'veworked very hard on is controlling the cost of Model Y . And our steady-state forecast for thatprogram puts the cost at roughly equivalent to Model 3. So there will be ramp inefficiencies at first,of course, as we launch the program. But as it stabilizes with steady-state production, we do expectthat it will be a higher-margin product."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "It's something that we're very excited about within thecompany.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Thank you. And the last question from institutional investors is, can you provide an updateon FSD package attach rates? As FSD attach rates improve, will you let the financial benefitsmanifest in higher gross margins for company and shareholders? Or will you lower the price todrive delivery volume?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI don't think we're going to need to lower the price of FSD. But I expect the price of FSD toincrease slowly as the functionality and capability improve. That's -- that is unchanged. Anythingyou want to add? I mean, our cash gross margin obviously is higher than our GAAP gross marginbecause of unrecognized revenue associated with FSD attach rates. So that's why I think it's in theorder of $600 million or in the order of $0.5 billion...Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFO$500 million.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & Director$0.5 billion of unrecognized revenue. So if you were to include that, which would obviously berecognized as we release the Full Self-Driving functionality, but actual gross margin that we'reoperating on, on a cash basis today is higher than the GAAP gross margin.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Let's now go to questions from retail investors. The first question from Craig is, can youprovide more detail on the DeepScale acquisition, its importance and whether Tesla is still on trackto recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs with automatic driving on city streets by theend of 2019?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorSure. DeepScale is a very tiny company. It's basically about 12 people. And it's -- they have someexpertise in increasing the efficiency of neural net for a given amount of compute, which I think ishelpful. So it remains to be seen. But the intent behind what was a very tiny acquisition, was to, Ithink, slightly accelerate FSD. That's the intent. And hopefully, that will turn out to be true. Yes.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The second question, we've already answered regarding Model Y delivery. So we'll jump tothe third question from Craig. News reports suggest that Gigafactory 3 already -- may already beproducing Model 3s for Chinese markets."

    {
        "paragraph": "Could you please update us on the productionexpectations for Giga 3 and confirm purpose of the second building now being built? Is that forbattery production as suggested by some press outlets?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. We're in trial production of Model 3. We're basically sending cars through the system, andwe're ramping rapidly. We're expecting to hit volume production in a few months essentially.The second building is, indeed, for battery and module production. And that's probably going to --because there's obviously a bunch more construction beyond what's already there becauseobviously, we need to build out facilities for Model Y production at Shanghai as well.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The next question from retail investors is, can you update us on the initial results of Tesla carinsurance? Is there a time line to expand it nationally and internationally?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, I can take that. So far, we've launched Tesla Insurance in California. I have to say that I'm quitepleased by the results so far. The take rate, as measured by quote-to-purchase conversioning arequite high by industry standards. And we expect that this will only increase as folks understand theproducts better and receive some of the known price increases coming from some of the standardcarriers that they'll come to us and look for an alternative.There's a bunch of work happening behind the scenes on improving the product, particularly thepurchase flow, to make sure it's the best product experience for our customers. And we're alsoworking very hard to get other states lined up in the States and then also to launch in some countriesinternationally. So we're not able to provide specific time lines on those changes, but we'redefinitely working as quickly as we can given how well received Tesla Insurance has been inCalifornia.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think it also has a secondary effect of ensuring that the third-party providers of insuranceprovide reasonable rates to our customers.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOI completely agree. The goal here is not to have an outsized market share of insurance. It's just tomake sure that customers have an alternative to other companies as well if those rates are high. Imean ultimately, what makes the most sense for total cost of ownership perspective is for folks tohave good pricing on their insurance.Elon R."

        "paragraph": "Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. And the last question from retail investors. There's skepticism regarding your comment thatthe Full Self-Driving will be feature-complete by year-end, like resulting from confusion aboutfeature-complete, what feature-complete means. Could you please talk to this and perhaps give us alist of features that establish the FSD baseline?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorFeature-complete, I mean, it's able -- the car's able to drive from one's house to work, most likelywithout interventions. So it will still be supervised, but it will be able to drive -- it will fill in the gapfrom low-speed autonomy -- we've got low-speed autonomy with Summon. We've got high-speedautonomy on the highway. And we've got intermediate speed autonomy, which really just meanstraffic lights and stop signs.So feature-complete means it's most likely able to do that without intervention, without humanintervention, but it would still be supervised.And I've gone through this time line before, I think, several times. But it is often misconstrued. Butthere's like -- there's 3 major levels to autonomy. There's the car being able to be autonomous butrequiring supervision and intervention at times; that's feature-complete. Then there's -- and itdoesn't mean like every scenario, everywhere on earth including every corner case. It means mostof the time.And then there's another level which is that we think it's -- that from a Tesla standpoint, we thinkthe car is safe enough to be driven without supervision.Then the third level would be that regulators are also convinced that the car can be drivenautonomously without supervision. Those are the 3 different levels.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Thank you very much. Sherrine, we can now go to the questions from analysts."

        "paragraph": "Our first question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research.Daniel V . Galves - Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research & Senior AnalystI was hoping that you could give us a little bit more color on sizing up the key factors in the autogross margin improvement from Q3 to Q2. Particularly, you mentioned some nonrecurring items inthe letter. And also, should investors be prepared for any meaningful headwinds as the China plantcomes up but isn't at full production yet?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. I can provide a couple of comments on that. So on your final -- on your last question aboutChina headwinds, there are always ramp inefficiencies when we launch a new factory. So we don'texpect China to be any different than that. So there will be some that we experience in Q4. Theamount of that is hard to forecast given that it's a different type of factory design than we did here inFremont. We're working very hard to limit the ramp inefficiencies, but certainly, fixed costabsorption and having all of the labor ready as we ramp will have an impact on Q4.And on the margin improvement, a couple of things there for auto gross margin. As I mentioned inmy opening remarks, S and X average selling prices increased from Q2 to Q3. I mean that'simportant. As I mentioned in the last earnings call, the prior powertrain versions of S and Xprovided significant headwinds on average selling price for that product in the quarter.We've also done a bunch of work as a company to become more targeted in how we adjust pricingon our products and how we optimize that based on local supply and demand. And so I think there'sa bunch of good work from the team on that in Q3, which flowed through on our financials.And cost reduction has just remained a huge focus for us. It's hard to underestimate how much ofthat has been ingrained in the culture of the company. And Jerome and his team have doneabsolutely tremendous work there. So on every line item of our cost, whether it be manufacturing,labor, warehousing, logistics, there's just a tremendous amount of good work that happened there.Specifically on nonrecurring items, to that, I'll note one being the Smart Summon revenuerecognition. Debatable whether that's considered recurring or not given that we continue to expectto release more features and release revenue associated with that in the future."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.George M. Dailey - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research AssociateThis is George Dailey on for Adam. So first question. Is it a fair assumption to say that once theShanghai Gigafactory has ramped, the Model 3s sold in China for China could be the mostprofitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont right now?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOThat one is also difficult to forecast. It's a good question. At least based on the plans that we havenow, we're expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model 3 is coming out of our Fremontfactory. There's still a bunch of work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch withramp inefficiencies, and we need to work those costs down. And then there will be work to land onwhat the right mix is within the country and where we ultimately land on the product offering. So Ithink just for now, it's safe to assume that it's roughly in line with the margins that you see comingout of the Fremont facility.George M. Dailey - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research AssociateGreat. And if I could just sneak in one more. So it's been over 7 years since you launched the ModelS, and many OEMs seem that they don't have the same commitment to battery electric vehicles thatyou do, and many don't even offer one right now. As your business model proves to be moresustainable, could we potentially see Tesla maybe supplying other OEMs with batteries or software,complete electric vehicle architectures maybe in an effort to accelerate mass adoption of sustainabletransport?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think there's -- it will be consistent with the mission of Tesla to help other car companies withelectric vehicles on the battery and powertrain fronts, also in other fronts. So it's something we'reopen to. As I think a lot of people know, we open-source our patents so that those would not serveas an obstacle to the adoption of electric vehicles or solar power or stationary storage. And we'redefinitely open to supplying batteries and powertrains and perhaps other things to other carcompanies."

The first is software Version 10 added a lot of functionality that's never reallybeen available in a car before through an over-the-air update. In your shareholder letter, you say thatthis lays an important foundation for things to come. Can you just talk about the longer-term plan oryour vision for the direction of this software platform and if you have plans to monetize thatopportunity?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, the goal for the infotainment system is to say what's the most amount of fun you can have in acar, which I think is -- I don't think other car companies really think about it that way. But it's reallywhat is the most fun -- how can we maximize the enjoyment in a car such that it's not some -- justsome sort of transport utility device with no soul and no character. We want it to be fun andentertaining in reference to something that you love.And so just I think there's a lot one can do because people are generally spending a couple of hoursa day on average in the car. And so that's pretty high percentage of the waking time, outside of likeshowering and going to the bathroom and that kind of thing. It's just a lot of time. And I guessmaybe there's some way to monetize it but we haven't really thought about it that way.But our goal is just to make -- try to say what is the most fun you could possibly have while you'rein your car. And obviously, as autonomy gets better and better, that is going to become much moreof an entertainment opportunity. So we'll see where that leads. But that's what we're after. It's ourgoal.Maynard Joseph Um - Macquarie Research - AnalystGreat. And then can you help us -- help frame for us the opportunity for emission credits as thestandards in the EU start to tighten next year? And I'm not looking for an exact number but maybemore to understand whether this is an opportunity in the tens of millions, hundreds of millions,billions. Anything to help us frame the opportunity and also whether you have any ongoingdialogues with OEMs.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWe certainly have ongoing dialogues with OEMs."

It was really quite...Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOIt was over $100 million.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorBut out of like several billions. So it's like 1.5%. It's not exactly a giant percentage. And obviously,those credits in the U.S. are really not -- a credit situation not particularly strong for obviousreasons, which we think is not great for the future. But anyway, that's the way it is.In Europe, it's much more of a sensitivity to the environment. But we're not counting on some bigwindfall. Maybe it will be good. Maybe not. We don't know. But we're not counting on it.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. I think that's a fair way to characterize it. I mean our expectation is that credit revenues willgenerally increase with time, not necessarily increasing every quarter. We did increase from Q2 toQ3. But there's a certain amount of them that are baseline based on the number of cars that we buildand deliver. And there's others that are deal-specific, and those deals can happen at any point.So we're constantly in conversations with automakers about this. But within the company, wemanage the business without counting on any profit or cash flows from regulatory credit. And weview it as purely incremental, and my recommendation is that everyone should view it that way. It'sjust an extra that comes through.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorIt's obviously a good thing to do that would help accelerate the advent of sustainable energy forsure. But it's -- and like I say, I think outside the U.S., there seems to be a strong push in thatdirection, which is great. And probably within the U.S., that over time will become a strong push."

First, there's been a lot of activity in the industry about electricpickups lately. Just curious if you have any updates, any more insights you can share on the one thatyou're about to put out later.And then secondly, there was a comment, I think, earlier about the order book quarter to date. Canyou just clarify what was the baseline? And any insights about the geographic mix of that?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. We -- I think we've said enough about the Tesla side of the truck. We're not going to -- this isnot the right forum for us to do product launches. But I think it'll be -- will be -- I mean, myopinion, and this could be totally wrong, it could be totally out to lunch here, but I think the Teslaside of truck is our best product ever. That's my opinion. Yes. The demand is not -- it seems to bestrong. So we should be production-constrained this quarter.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, that's right. The baseline from the comment earlier that I made was looking at this point in thequarter in Q2. And order rates are strong, I would say, in all markets. I think we're very encouragedas a team at the reception of our products. As more and more people become aware of electricvehicles, I think competitive products help raise that awareness, and overall interest is justincreasing.So our focus internally is to increase production as fast as we can, both with the existing equipmentand accelerating our timelines on new capacity. We believe that everybody should be driving anelectric car. So we need to move as quickly as we can.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely. But we want to get the Tesla volume to where it is, perhaps somewhere on the orderof 1% -- replacing 1% of the global fleet over time. That's, I think -- we think it's pretty big, butthat's -- we think that's a good one to aim for, which is about 20 million vehicles a year, just by theway.But I do think that the demand for new cars will rise as the world transitions away from combustionengine vehicles."

They'll buy an electric car because it's afundamentally better car, and especially if it's got self-driving."

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorIt's muffled, but we'll try.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOkay. Sorry for that. So I was wondering how your thinking has evolved on Model S and Model X.It looks like the deliveries have stayed to the levels of the previous quarter and that Model 3 hasindeed cannibalized this demand for these cars quite a big deal. So how are you thinking aboutthese 2 models going forward? What's the strategy you have in mind? And then I have a quickfollow-up on the Model Y .Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThe Models S and X are really niche -- they're really niche products. I mean they're very expensive,made in low volume. To be totally frank, we'll keep -- we're continuing to make them more forsentimental reasons than anything else. They're really of minor importance to the future.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOkay. That makes sense. And then my question...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThey're a great car. Model S, I think, is by -- if you want to -- I mean Model S literally won MotorTrend's best car ever in history, by the way. I think if you're out there and you're buying -- andyou're sedan-buying and you don't buy a Model S, I think you've just made a mistake, to be totallyfrank. It's incredible, especially the new one with variable damping, suspension, hospital operatingroom, HEPA filter for air purification, the Raven powertrain. It's the fastest car in the world. And it'sjust it's so easy to drive. It makes you feel like Superman driving that car. It's incredibly safe. It'sjust an amazing vehicle.And then Model S, I think, it's like the Faberg\u00c3\u00a9 egg of cars -- I mean Model X. Model X is likethe Faberg\u00c3\u00a9 egg of cars."

They're absolutely phenomenal cars. And we are increasingproduction on kind of S and X lines for this quarter in response to increasing demand. And so Ithink part of the story here is, as we've launched, ramped and stabilized Model 3, that consumes alot of the attention around the company. But now that -- as that has stabilized, we're able to focusour attention and balance that between S and X and Model 3.And so the delivery numbers in Q3 understated the interest in the product for that quarter. And wecontinue to see strength in the order rate, which we anticipate will be reflected in S and X deliveriesin Q4.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI mean Model S -- basically, Model S at this point has a range of 370 miles. Actually, technically,it's 373, but we actually certified it incorrectly at 370. But it's 373. And there are some softwareimprovements that we think will make that even better.Oh I forgot to mention, we're also expecting that there's going to be out there improvement -- thatwill improve the power of the Model S, X and 3.

You're targeting 3,000 units a week. But we sawwith Fremont that the ramp on Model 3 was lumpy. And you'd sort of ramp and then you sort of cutproduction to fix the bottlenecks. Given that this is a brand-new capacity, how smooth should weexpect production to be on a week-to-week basis? Meaning once you hit the 3,000, is that 3,000 youcould go every single week in a quarter? Or is it still going to be lumpy within a quarter?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI mean if you've got a crystal ball, we'd love to use it.Dan Meir Levy - Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystI'm looking for it.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. It should be smoother than Model 3 because there's a lot of commonality of parts. But -- and Ithink if you look over a reasonable enough time frame, the production will actually be fairlysmooth. But from a week-to-week standpoint, it obviously will not be. It will be about as smooth as,say, the stock market. I mean how smooth is the stock market from one week to the next? It's -- butif you just extend the time period to, say, 2 or 3 quarters, it will be a very rapid steady ramp. Andobviously, it will go way past 3,000 a week.Dan Meir Levy - Cr\u00c3\u00a9dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystOkay. Great. And then just a follow-up. You mentioned -- Elon, you mentioned earlier in yourcomments that one of the things you're optimistic on in the future is Tesla Energy. And I think weunderstand the part that one of the challenges in the past was sort of a reallocation of resourcesaway from energy to the auto side. Could you just talk to where you see the greatest pockets ofgrowth in energy? Is it solar or storage?

From one quarter to the next, there might be somefluctuations due to seasonality or some short-term part shortage or you name it, but it could be, overthe course of, say, a year, gigantic increase.Also with solar, it's hard to install a lot of solar in the winter, especially on the East Coast.
