        "paragraph": "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast. My name isMartin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhornand a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Timein the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has someopening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you, Martin. So just a Q1 recap. Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind inEurope and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United States. And this is in spite of a lot ofchallenges in production and delivery, so it's a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving thesegreat results. The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain. Idon't think I'm telling anyone anything people don't already know, especially with large purchasessuch as cars.And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it's worth noting that our operating marginremains among the best in the industry. We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and alarger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin. However, we expectour vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy. So we dobelieve we're like laying the groundwork here, and that it's better to ship a large number of cars at alower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy. This isan extremely important point.Let's see. Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on ourpilot line for testing purposes. It's a great product, and we're completing the installation of thevolume production line at Giga Texas, and we're anticipating having delivery event, a great deliveryevent probably in Q3.As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and thenaccelerates. So the Cybertruck is no different. So it's -- there's tremendous amount of demand forthe product, obviously."

        "paragraph": "And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer. But as with all newproducts, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going. And this is, really, a very radicalproduct. It's not made in the way that other cars are made.So let's see, with regards to Megapack, we're making great progress. Our energy storagedeployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1. This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever. Andthis growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Megafactory in Lathrop, California. There's still some way to go to reach the full run rates of 40 gigawatt hours per year. And then weadditionally announced the start of a new Megafactory in Shanghai. So we're -- as we've expected,the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. We've now crossed over 150 million miles driven byFull Self-Driving beta, and this number is growing exponentially. We're -- I mean, this is a dataadvantage that really no one else has. Those who understand AI will understand the importance ofdata -- of training data and how fundamental that is to achieving an incredible outcome.So yes, so we're also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of themain limiting factors of achieving full autonomy. So we're continuing to simultaneously makesignificant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort into Dojo, which we believehas the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training. And it also -- Dojoalso has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in thesame way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.So I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.In conclusion, we're taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further,and we'll continue to invest in growth as fast as possible. Once again, I'd like to give a huge thanksto all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again. And yes, superappreciated."

        "paragraph": "Thank you very much. And Zach has some remarks as well.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOThanks, Martin. I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production anddeliveries. And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.There are 3 main points I want to make. First, automotive gross margin and operating marginreduced sequentially. But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels. In particular,automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earningscall, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehiclepricing and onetime items, most notably, warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well asincreased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot features as we transition technologies.Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics andthe beginnings of some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized. Per unit cost for Austinand Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes. However, these factories still provide amargin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and stabilize at our intendedvolumes.Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balancedmix of build and deliveries. As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries andproduction within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter andhas an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows. This was particularly prevalent in Q1for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years ofinvestment and focus. This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company'srevenue and reached its highest level yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for ourMegapack products. We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highestgross profit yet in the quarter.Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we're operating the business this year. Ourapproach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses. Weplan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, in-house cell production, energy storage business and our Autonomy and AI-enabled products."

        "paragraph": "Thank you very much. And let's go to investor questions on say.com. The first one is what is theprocess to make auto pricing adjustments? What variables do you consider? How frequently do youreview pricing?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFODo you want to take that, Elon, or do you want me to take that?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorMy apologies. Sorry, I was on mute. Yes, I think this is not something that we can really talk about.It's just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and wemake a decision. But it's -- yes, unless there's something you'd like to add, Zach.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOI think that's right. I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis andcertainly, I can't get into the details of the reasons why certain decisions are made. But it issomething that's very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team."

        "paragraph": "Thank you. The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto? Andwhen will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, I should just clarify, like, bigger than auto from the standpoint of, like, total gigawatt hoursdeployed. So it's possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours, I think, will beprobably higher with stationary storage. If you just look at the -- what's needed to transition theworld to a sustainable energy economy, there is more stationary energy storage needed than there ismobile energy storage. So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess ofautomotive, so that is in line with expectations.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with thenext question, which is on guidance for margins, just have a single comment there. I think we are --we will get to the point where we, as a company, provide guidance on the storage business.I say storage as a combination of both the Megapack business and the Powerwall business. Relativeto total revenues of the company, it's still fairly small. And the business has a lot of volatilitycurrently, both in terms of volumes as well as financials, just given the small volumes and kind ofdiversification of the customer pool there.But as this business grows and smooths out, I don't think we're that far away from it. I thinkincluding these volumes on our day 2 production and deliveries release is something that we'll startdoing and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the comingyear. I think it'll be a few more quarters before we get there."

        "paragraph": "Thank you. And the next question, as you said, was already answered, so let's go to the batteryquestion.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOSorry. Just one other thing I wanted to mention on margin. While we're not providing specificguidance there, I mean, just to set expectations of where we think this business will go in terms ofmargins, probably generally in the ballpark of what we've seen historically on the vehicle business.We generally look to mid-20% gross margins for any program that we launch. And so we're notthere yet on this business, but that's what we're working towards.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe're hopeful to get there later this year, but that's not a promise. That's an aspiration."

        "paragraph": "Thank you. The next question is, how well are 4680 cells meeting the expectations described on theBattery Day? How long will it be until the cells meet those goals? Drew?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. So on Battery Day, we established a cost-down roadmap through 2026 across 5 areas of effort.There was the cell design we discussed, anode and cathode materials, the structural pack conceptand the cell factory itself, and we've been making progress across all of these aspects since then.For the cell factory, the Texas 4680 factory, we are partway through building and commissioningand selling and operating, will be 70% lower CapEx per gigawatt hour than typical cell factorieswhen fully ramped, in line with what we described on Battery Day. And we're continuing to furtherpursue densification and investment reduction opportunities in future factory build-outs like inNevada. On the cell design, we're in production with not only the first generation tabless cell weunveiled in Battery Day, but a second more manufacturer version in Texas today.On the cathode materials side, we have a number of activities underway per the Battery Dayroadmap. For lithium, our Corpus Christi Lithium refinery breaks ground this May. Our goal is tostart commissioning portions of the facility before the end of the year. The refinery uses the sulfate-free spodumene refining process with reduced process costs, no acid or caustic reagents, lowerembodied energy. It actually produces a beneficial byproduct that can be repurposed in constructionmaterials. We discussed all of these concepts on Battery Day.Same with cathode precursor, we've successfully demonstrated lower process cost, zero-waste waterprecursor process that we described on Battery Day at both lab and pilot scale and are in thedetailed design phase for incorporating this technology into the front end of our Austin cathodefacility.On cathode production, we are 50% equipment and 75% utilities installed at our new cathodebuilding in Austin with our goal to begin dry and wet commissioning this quarter and next quarterwith a target to produce first material before the end of the year.Structural pack, we saw big improvements with pack manufacturing with the 4680 cell and thestructural pack concept, 50% lower CapEx and 66% smaller factory for the same output in gigawatthours per year. We do believe structural as a concept is a good one. It's simpler."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "We'll continue tostructurally load the cells and use the pack as the floor of the vehicle while iterating the design tocloser to B-level execution of this A-level architecture in future programs.And zooming out for the 4680 team, Q1 was all about cost and quality. We made significantimprovements in both areas. Texas production increased 50% quarter-over-quarter through yields,increased 12%; in Kato peak rate increased by 20%; and through yields improved by 20%.Altogether, the team accomplished a 25% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on trackto achieve steady-state cost targets over the next 12 months. And going forward for the rest of theyear, the priority one is yield in cost for the 4680 program as we steadily ramp production ahead ofCybertruck next year."

    {
        "paragraph": "Thank you very much. The next question is, what do you anticipate 2023 automotive gross marginsex credits will be at the company's current pricing levels?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes, I can start off on this one. This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this. There'sa lot of macro uncertainty. There are also headwinds and tailwinds. And this is basically a question,I think, that's asking about viewpoint and where costs will go. And within costs, there's a set ofcosts in which we do control the set of costs in which we're kind of subject to what's going on in themacro world.Within the bucket of things we control, the most of the cost down that we're working on is aroundramping our Austin factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we getto our intended volumes there. And a part of the cost journey in the Austin factory is, as Drewmentioned, the 4680 cells, which is an input into our Austin COGS. And so as the 4680 programimproves over the course of the year on cost, as Drew mentioned, and then the noncell portion ofthe factory improves, we see a pretty good trajectory in the Austin facility.A similar story exists in the Berlin factory. It does not have 4680 as an input, but for that factory, thejourney to complete localization is still ongoing. And so over the course of this year, as volumeincreases, more localization occurs, we do see a good path to cost reduction in the Berlin factory aswell. In existing factories, too, we talk about this on every call, so I don't need to rehash it, but theexpectation is that every existing factory improves all of their key metrics, and we continue to seethe progress there.There's also a handful of other costs in which we have influence, but the philosophy here is thatwe're aggressively going across every cost bucket that we can."

        "paragraph": "Within the world that we don'tcontrol, the 2 major costs there being logistics, which fortunately is moving in our favor, and I thinkour supply chain team has done a great job, both on logistics optimization and taking advantage ofreduced spot rates where they can, so thank you to our supply chain team.And then there's the commodities world, which has been a huge pinch point in our cost structureover the last, say, 2 years or so, and we're still kind of at the maximum of pain for commodities inour cost structure. It kind of maxed down in the second half of last year. We did start to see, in Q1, alittle bit of improvement. We think there'll be a little bit more improvement in Q2, but...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorLithium has dropped a lot. It's worth mentioning that the price of lithium has dropped significantly.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. And that's the piece that we expect to see more impact from in Q2. And generally, as acompany, we do expect commodity prices to come down and have a more meaningful impact in thesecond half of the year.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOSo this is our approach.

        "paragraph": "Yes.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes.Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior ResearchAnalystOkay. Perfect. So first question was on Lathrop. Obviously, that's -- it's great to see the growththere. Just wondering when you think that facility might be closer to full utilization? Are you justsort of deliberately working your way up the S curve there? Demand, obviously, isn't the limitation.So what are what are the steps, I guess, to unlocking full utilization there?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSure. There are some classic factory ramp aspects of what's going on in Lathrop. We actually had 2phases of the CapEx there, replaced some of the general assembly parts of the facility. But inaddition, we also have ramps with our suppliers that we are following, so both on the sell side andon the power electronics side. And we will see that unlock in the latter half of this year with -- aswell as those inputs. So the overall facility was phased with the second phase of CapEx coming upon towards the end of this year.Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior ResearchAnalystOkay. Great. And then I guess my second question is on your ability to serve other markets out ofShanghai. Obviously, the facility in Berlin should be opening up your ability to, I guess, allocatemore vehicles to Southeast Asia, Australia, other areas. I'm just wondering what other regions doyou think you're maybe not yet serving effectively. What are your time lines for addressing some ofthose gaps in your regional exposure?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. That's a good question, because there are still many parts of the world that we do not yet servewith respect to vehicles especially. So we do expect to open up new markets around the world. Andwhile those markets are not necessarily individually gigantic, they do add up a whole bunch ofmarkets. They do collectively sum up to something significant. So it's high time that Tesla offerthese cars to the rest of the world, and that is something that we intend to do."

Let's go to the next analyst, George from Canaccord.George Gianarikas - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - AnalystI was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you've seen anysignificant positive or negative change there? And also, given that you've reduced the prices foryour vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, to kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it's a tricky pricing questionbecause the value of a car that is autonomous is enormous. So in a way, the price right now is anoption value on an autonomous vehicle. And that value is -- will ultimately be very significant. Andit's really -- yes, I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I mean, you can see theimprovements are really quite dramatic. There'll be a little bit of 2 steps forward, 1 step backbetween releases for those trying the beta. But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving,towards full autonomy. And I hesitate to say this, but I think we'll do it this year. So that's what itlooks like, yes.George Gianarikas - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - AnalystMaybe on the dramatic change we've seen in EV-related commodity prices. Do you think it's areflection of any recent overcapacity in mining and refining? Or is that sort of a coincident indicatoron global EV demand? And how do you expect those prices to kind of track over the next severalquarters?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorMan, I wish I had a crystal ball to answer your question. I don't know if we can provide a question(sic) [an answer] that would -- with -- that would have any value really. I think we're in uncertaintimes. And if somebody got a crystal ball they can lend me, I'd really like to borrow it. But these areuncertain times.My guess is this -- it's economic stormy weather for about a year or so. And then if we hold roughly12 months and then -- but this is my guess. It's just pure speculation. Stormy weather for about 12months and then, provided there are no major geopolitical wildcards that show up, that things startgetting sunny around spring next year.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc."

        "paragraph": "- SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringThe only thing I would say on the, like, EV materials markets. They're not all super liquid and someof them, for example, like, less than -- like, single-digit percentage of the market is actually tradedon the spot market. And not only are they not super liquid, there's not -- like, storage isn'tparticularly facile for all of materials. So, like, small mismatches in supply and demand drive, likelarge price swings, not really -- real price swings, but just like temporarily large price swings. So it'shard to read into those price wings. I don't know, Karn, if you want to add anything.Karn Budhiraj -Yes. Well, this is Karn, by the way. We are seeing, as Elon mentioned, quite a bit of softening in thelithium carbonate market. This was -- 6 months ago, we were trading at like $85,000 a ton, andtoday's spot price is about 26%. So there's been a dramatic decrease in that. Of course, we were ableto take advantage of low lithium pricing earlier on with fixed-price contracts. And we find that thisis going to be another opportunity -- opportune moment to basically extend that into the later half ofthe decade.But we -- at the quantities we're procuring, we're not as impacted by the spot market because wehave all those contracts in place, and we're just going to be going and doing more of that. The otherthing that's happening is because of the price spike. A lot of the companies that are in this businessare becoming more ambitious about finding more upstream resources and exploring locations inAfrica as well as South America. So that's also helping the macro situation with pricing.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. But just on the lithium front, to emphasize, the choke point is more -- much more on refiningcapacity than it is on mining. Lithium is actually -- is very common throughout the world, includingin the U.S. and, really, it's just a very common element on earth. It's lithium. So it's much more aquestion of where is the refining capacity and can the refining capacity keep up. That's really whatmatters more than where is the lithium ore. It's everywhere basically.I think that same question also extends to refining of the cathode, and to some degree, refining ofthe anode."

So can other people please do those work?That would be great. We're begging you. We don't want to do it. Can someone please?

        "paragraph": "Yes, we can. Yes.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystMaybe a first question for Elon, on your pricing strategy. So if I understand your message, you'resaying Tesla feels it's worth maximizing the volume, increasing the size of the fleet as fast as youcan because you'll be able to monetize this over the life cycle of the vehicle. Could you be a littlebit more specific around ways you would be able to monetize sort of, like, this existing fleet in thefuture? Obviously, I think Autonomous seems to be a big piece of it, but my understanding was thatrobotaxi would probably be for the next-generation vehicle, not the existing one? So I guess inwhich ways would you monetize it?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSorry, the robotaxi terminology can be a bit confusing, because that's sort of like a generic term forour next-generation vehicle. And we obviously are working on next-generation vehicle. That'sgoing to be very compelling. This is just not the time to talk about it in details, the product. So weinternally call it robotaxi.But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware 3, which is the vast majority of our fleet, webelieve will achieve full autonomy. So there will be a -- like, a Model 3 or Model Y would be arobotaxi, a robotic taxi. So yes, that's -- to the best of my knowledge that -- we believe the currenthardware can achieve full autonomy.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystUnderstood. And then maybe a question for Zach. Back on the automotive gross margins. So Ithink, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that 20%automotive gross margin was still probably a reasonable floor.Obviously, the macro has gone worse and additional price cuts have happened. Is there anythingelse that has changed in terms of the outlook? Is it just the macro deteriorating? Is it the competitivelandscape? Anything else that's sort of, like, makes you think differently around the full year? Andis there a way, therefore, to frame a floor?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. About half of the miss against that previous conversation last quarter is attributed toadjustments we made in pricing in the second half of the quarter."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "I mean, I guess you could arguethat, that lowers the floor in a sense. We've also made pricing adjustments so far this quarter. So thatbrings it down further.About the other half of the miss in Q1 was attributed to things that are nonrecurring. So I mentionedthese in my opening remarks. It's a warranty adjustment for cars that were previously produced butnot part of the pedigree of cars we're building now and some autopilot-related deferrals as we makesome technology changes here that this deferral should get recognized once some of the softwarecatches up. So those 2 things are nonrepeating. So hopefully, that helps answer your question.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, there are really 2 macro factors that are tricky, the biggest being the interest rate. So ifthere's a very high Fed rate or interest rates are very high, that -- that is -- every time the Fed raisesthe interest rates, that's equivalent to increasing the price of a car. It makes the cars less affordablebecause people are able to buy cars as a function of what they can afford on a monthly basis. Sothat's -- so it's just almost directly equivalent to a price increase is any kind of interest rate increase.Then the other factor is whenever there is uncertainty in the economy, people will generallypostpone new -- big, new capital purchases like a new car. This is natural human reaction. So ifpeople are reading about layoffs and whatnot in the press, they're like, well, they might be worriedabout -- they might be laid off. So then they'll be, naturally, a little more hesitant than they wouldotherwise be to buy a new car. Now this is just the nature of the auto industry. But there is -- therewill be a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for new cars, so -- but it goes through cycles."

Incorporated, Research Division - SeniorResearch AnalystWhen you talk about many fish to fry, you talked about Dojo being a product that you can selloutside of Tesla. How do we rank all the things you have going on and then -- in the economicenvironment? I mean, like heat pumps and everything else you have going on versus investing inthe vehicle business? Or is that not the right way to look at it?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI'm not sure I fully understand your question, but I'd look at Dojo as, like, kind of a long-shot bet,but if it's a long-shot bet that pays off, it'll pay off in a very, very big way. But potentially -- yes,potentially in a very, very big way, like, in the multi-hundred billion dollar level. But the thing with,like, still put it in the long-shot category, but long shot with a multi-hundred billion dollar potentialoutcome.

And that is on our list over time is to do a reallygood heat pump for homes and commercial offices and stuff. And we have the technology that'sreally good. But it's still -- it's a back burner item.Our focus is very much on vehicles, autonomy, stationary storage, basically solving sustainableenergy and solving autonomy, which would be, like -- solving autonomy, if we're able to have afleet of several million vehicles that -- with a software update can be potentially worth several timestheir original value, that's -- that will be -- if that happens, that will be the -- and I think it willhappen, that will be the biggest asset value increase in history, I think.Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorNo, it's really just like -- every day, we get a daily real-time update of how many cars were orderedyesterday, how many cars were produced yesterday. We must have -- if there's a company that's gotmore real-time data than Tesla -- I'm not sure there's any company on earth that has better real-timedata than Tesla, except maybe SpaceX Starlink.So -- because, like, we don't have to -- for the other car companies, they will make the cars, sendthem to the dealers, then the dealers will sell the cars. And then it takes quite a long time for themto get the data back to actually figure out how many cars were sold. Whereas we know how manycars were ordered yesterday throughout the world. So our fingers on the pulse is real-time and doesnot have latency, whereas the other car companies have a lot of latency in their data.As does the government, the government has a lot of latency in the data. So we're just looking at itand saying, okay, what does it take to achieve a clearing price for our vehicle production? And thenwe'll make a pricing change, and we see what happens immediately and adjust course.So we're adjusting course and we're thinking about it literally every day, 7 days a week. Every -- 7days a week, I look at that e-mail and so does the rest of the team. And we try to make the leastdumb decision that we can. And on balance, I think our decisions are pretty good. Sometimes they'llbe down, but on average, they're, I think, better than the rest of the industry.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOJust to add on the question about EV market share or ICE. This comes up a lot. I think a lot of thepublic debate is around this concept of EV market share. We don't look at it that way. I mean, welook at it as on picture of cars. It's a car market and not the EV market. And actually, the mission ofthe company requires internal combustion engine cars to be switched over to electric vehicles."

We'll look back, I don't know,assuming civilization is still around in 20 years, we'll look back on internal combustion enginevehicles the same way we look back on external combustion engine vehicles, which is, like, thesteam engine.

Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior AnalystCan you talk a little bit about how much of the actual cost structure is variable on these vehicles?And if you could give us a range on plus or minus the lithium cost within those contracted volumesthat you're seeing?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, I think -- again, would really love to have a crystal ball here, but we don't have it. Dependingon what time scale you're looking at, most of the cars are variable -- so -- most of the car cost isvariable. So -- and probably, if I were to guess, I think we will see improved costs from suppliers.Yes, I think we will -- that is our expectation.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd we're already starting to see that, Elon, I think you had mentioned before that we anticipated acrash in the lithium prices and some of that has flowed through by way of lithium carbonatereductions into battery cost. And the same thing will happen with lithium hydroxide. The length ofthe supply chain matters also because what we're talking about is very far upstream.So by the time it makes its way into the battery that slip in a car, it'll be several months. But beyondjust commodity pricing, as Zach mentioned earlier, we're also very focused on other metrics thatmake production very efficient. So for example, detention and demurrage, error expedites. I thinkour error expedites are down 90%. Detention and demurrage is down 93% from the peaks. That canbe hundreds of thousands of dollars per vehicle. So we're sort of attacking all vectors and becomingvery efficient.Colin William Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior AnalystOkay. And then my follow-up is really around stationary storage demand on the utility scale. Imean, obviously, there's a gigantic queue for interconnection in the U.S. And can you talk about thevolume of quotation you're seeing at this point around stationary storage for the renewables SKU ona global basis? And how much of that is converting into actual sales?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorDrew, do you want to take that?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc."

The next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.Mark Trevor Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity AnalystDo you still see 2 million units as an upside case for volume this year? And is the gating factor forreaching 1.8 million or 2 million units in 2023's supply chain, as was mentioned on your lastconference call? Or is it more about demand at this point?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, if you have a crystal ball you can lend me, back to the crystal ball situation. These are volatiletimes. From a production standpoint, if things go well, we've got a shot at 2 million vehicles thisyear. But that is an upside case. And we feel comfortable with 1.8 million. And we'll just have tosee how this year unfolds.Mark Trevor Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity AnalystThat's helpful. And then the company had spoken at the Investor Day and then for the pastconference calls about opening up its vehicle charging network. Can you speak to some of thefeedback you've been getting from both Tesla owners and non-Tesla owners? And how the ramp ofthe charging network may progress from here?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorDrew, do you want to take that?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. So as you may have seen, we opened our V4 post in Europe and our Magic Dock post in NorthAmerica in Q1, and that is indicative of the direction we're heading with universal compatibility forall vehicles, no matter where the charge port, et cetera, in all major markets, and we're going tocontinue to roll out those sort of improved offerings as we build new stations.We're always balancing, like, our ability to serve our own customers with our ability to serve newcustomers when doing that. I think we've been able to balance it rather well. For example, inEurope, 50% of all of our supercharging stations are open to all EVs, and we've been able to do thatwithout any increase in wait times at all for anybody. So we're going to continue to take a similarapproach as we do this in North America and China over the coming quarters."

Let's go to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystI just wanted to, first, just follow up on your comments in your letter about leveraging your costposition as others struggle with unit economics and also taking into account the lifetime revenue,actually in a way that most other automakers will never see just given your service network andsupercharging and other attributes.Can you just maybe give us a sense of how far you'd be willing to take this? Are there bracketsaround the range of initial margin that you'd be comfortable with? And again, any color that youmight provide on the updated range of margins that you'd expect in the auto business?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think we may have answered this question or tried to answer this question a few times. But it'sdifficult to say what the margin will be. It depends on what the macroeconomic environment is like.So for example, if the Fed were to lower the rates, that would be super helpful for demand. If theyraise them, that just raises the interest costs that buyers have to pay for to buy a car. So it reducesaffordability and therefore, reduces demand.So it's -- but if -- like, if we look past, say, this year or, like, go sometime next year, middle of nextyear, so I think things are looking really -- I think, like I said, we'll weather through if there aresome major geopolitical wildcard that turns up. But in the absence of that, I think I would be veryoptimistic about middle of next year, end of next year.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOJust to add to Elon's comments, just 2 other points. What's really important for us this year inaddition to just managing the day-to-day of the business but is also investing in, as Elon mentioned,what 2024 and 2025 will look like. And so using the cash generated from the sale of products todayand reinvesting that, this is very important for us.And I think that what happens to margins over the next couple of quarters that only matters in thecontext of what that means for our ability to reinvest into 2024 and 2025. And we have a lot ofspace before that becomes something that we have to revisit, our investment plans."

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystJust to elaborate on that point though, the revenue the long-term lifetime revenue that you'retargeting from each vehicle is massive. So if you took that to the extreme, it would seem that you'dbe comfortable with a relatively low initial margin. Am I misinterpreting that? Or is that exactlyright? And just\u00e2\u00a6Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorCorrect. That is exactly right.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystOkay. And the -- normally, in a recession, when consumers feel less financially secure, actuallyprice elasticity deteriorates. Just based on your pulse taking of the consumer, do you have a view onelasticity of demand?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, I can't emphasize enough the whole -- just fundamental question of affordability. For mostpeople, their ability to buy a car is a function of can they make monthly payment or not. And so likeI said, if interest rates are really high, like they are right now, in some cases, people can't get a loanat all. So it's -- I think probably banks are pretty -- not leaning forward in providing loans, I expect,these days.So that's -- but, like, the -- there is quite a powerful story here when you -- going back to somethingthat as alluded to a moment ago or mentioned a moment ago that Tesla is in a uniquely strongstrategic position. Because we're the only ones making cars that, technically, we could sell for 0profit for now and then yield actually tremendous economics in the future through autonomy. Noone else can do that. I'm not sure how many people will appreciate the profundity of what I've justsaid, but it is extremely significant."

I think, probably,there's some benefit, yes.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDI get it, Elon. So just as a follow-up on manufacturing, you're a student of history. And you'll notethat back in 1913, Henry Ford introduced the moving assembly line in Highland Park, Michigan.And the price of a Model T, which had already been undercutting cars around the time, fell another70% or 80%, and hundreds of rival car companies went bust. I'm wondering, if history is repeatingitself here, Elon, and that the recent pattern of cuts with you is way ahead of the cost curvecompared to competition, is this -- it seems like it's a calculated strategy, not just in reaction tocompetition or changing supply-demand in the market, but your -- could we catalyze someDarwinian forces in the EV market?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, I mean, we're not trying to, say, take pricing actions in order to be deliberately -- todeliberately undermine competitors or anything like that.

And just broadly, should we -- I mean,historically, you've been operating at the pace at which your supply allows you to produce asopposed to gauging to demand.Should we generally expect that you're going to continue to produce at your -- whatever the maxcapacity that you're allowed within your supply constraints, regardless of what the broadereconomic environment is just to continue to get that volume out there?Elon R.

And our final question comes from Philippe Houchois from Jefferies.Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Automotive AnalystIt's slightly longer term. I completely agree with your comments that we should look at Tesla interms of auto market share and not EV market share. But I'm just wondering, as you build up themarket share globally, is there a limit to the direct selling business model as you practice it? Andshould we think about -- going forward, you need to look into the agency or using importers tobasically develop market share more smoothly, I guess, globally? And so in other words, is therekind of tell-by date for the direct business model as you practice it today?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIt seems to be working well so far.Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Automotive AnalystBecause we hear different feedback from customers who miss the human interaction or unhappywith the service, and I'm just wondering if you're seeing some growth pains in there that would leadyou to change. You're not seeing that?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, I mean, there are -- since we're always going to have some growing pains where at times --and it depends on which geography we're talking about where sometimes service is behind sales,sometimes it's ahead of sales. This is -- I mean Tesla's growing, I believe, faster than any companyin history that makes a large complex manufactured object.So these are -- as you try to max -- it's always difficult to match exponentials. So -- but I think it ishelpful to have the feedback loop with a service, because that means we feel the pain of service, andthen we can adjust the design to make the car need less service. And I think that gives us the rightincentive structure, like, because the best service is no service. The car doesn't break.And whereas if you have, say, a dealer network that is reliant upon services revenue, then youarguably have a misalignment of incentives where they're making money on service. But actually,we want to -- the best thing for the consumer is the car doesn't need servicing, so.Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Automotive AnalystYes.

Actually, this one -- assuming I could wax on about for a while, because, really, people didn'tunderstand that the best short-selling argument against Tesla for the longest time was the fact thatTesla does not have an existing fleet and that the auto industry, the reason incumbents succeed andnewcomers fail, the biggest reason is that the incumbents have a large fleet, and they're able to sellnew cars at close to 0 margin and then sell spare parts at a very high margin, sort of razors andblades type thing.And so the only way to actually succeed, for a newcomer to succeed is to have a product that is socompelling that people are willing to pay a premium over the incumbent product. And in theabsence of electrification and autonomy, I don't think a newcomer can succeed."
