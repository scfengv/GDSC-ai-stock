I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Directorof Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2020Q&A Webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of otherexecutives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 1:15 p.m. Pacific time in the update deck wepublished at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events and resultscould differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in ourmost recent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. First of all, I'd like to thank the Tesla team for exceptional execution in the secondquarter despite tremendous difficulties. They've done an incredible job, and it's an honor to workwith such a great team. I mean there were so many challenges, too numerous to name, but they gotit done. And just what a great group to work with, like I said, it's just an honor to work with such agreat team.So -- and as a result, we were able to achieve our fourth consecutive profitable quarter. Andalthough the automotive industry was down about 30% year-over-year in the first half of the year,we managed to grow deliveries in the first half of the year. So despite that massive industry decline,we actually went up.We're also very excited to announce that we're going to be building our next Gigafactory in Texas.It's going to be right near Austin. It will be about -- I'll just go into a bit of detail on this, and thenI'm sure there'll be a lot of questions. But the location is 5 minutes from Austin InternationalAirport and 15 minutes from Downtown Austin, and it's about 2,000 acres, and we're going to makeit a factory that is going to be stunning. It's right on the Colorado River. So we're actually going tohave a boardwalk where there'll be a hiking/biking trail."

        "paragraph": "It's going to basically be an ecologicalparadise. Birds in the trees, butterflies, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public aswell. So not closed and only Tesla. So if anyone is interested in working at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please let us know. This is -- we're going to bedoing a major factory there. And it's also where we'll be doing -- we'll be doing Cybertruck there,the Tesla Semi, and we'll be doing Model 3 and Y for the eastern half of North America.Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California. So -- but we expectCalifornia to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the western half ofNorth America. And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would alsomake sense in California. So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California. And just toemphasize, we'll continue to grow in California, but we'll be creating a massive factory andCybertruck and Semi programs in Texas.So -- and I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much for -- to theTulsa team, the economic development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed. Thewhole Tesla team was super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for futureexpansion of Tesla down the road.Let's see. Is there anything more we want to say about? There's a lot of information. So anything,guys? All right. Well, I'm sure there'll be lots of questions.We've already started work on the facility, so some initial construction work. So it's alreadyunderway, started this weekend. Let's see, moving on to other subjects.Solar. We recently adjusted the pricing of our retrofit solar. So Tesla Solar is the lowest cost solar inthe United States. And we added the lowest cost guarantee and a money-back guarantee. So we'revery confident that people will have our solar product, whether it's the solar retrofit or Solar Roof.Our solar is now 30% cheaper than the U.S. average. After the federal tax credit, Tesla Solar nowcosts $1.49 per watt. And it's a very simple, highly automated single-click experience. So definitely,think about Tesla whether you want a new roof or Tesla Solar Roof or you want solar on yourexisting roof, either way, we're the company to go to."

        "paragraph": "And then you could also get a Powerwall andhave energy independence and be your own utility. So I think that product is really coming together,and it's only going to get better later this year. So just very excited about that business potential.On the additional technology stuff, we introduced the first production car with more than 400 milesrange. So the current Tesla Model S now has an EPA-certified range of 402 miles. I mean youbasically can drive from L.A. to San Francisco nonstop and still have some miles left over whenyou arrive. And this is at highway speed. So you don't have to do anything, drive slowly oranything, drive -- you can just drive normally and go very long distances.And then for Full Self-Driving, we launched traffic lights and stop signs, and we continue toimprove that to make them more robust. And we're currently testing Full Self-Driving software forintersections and city streets and narrow streets. So I personally tested the latest alpha build of theFull Self-Driving software when I drive my car. And it is really, I think, profoundly better thanpeople realize. Yes, really profoundly better. It's like amazing. So it's almost getting to a pointwhere I can go from my house to work with no interventions, despite going through constructionand widely varying situations. So this is why I'm very confident about Full Self-Drivingfunctionality being complete by the end of this year. It's because I'm literally driving it.In conclusion, I'd like to again say thanks for all the hard work of the Tesla team, achieving our firstfull year of profitability in the company history. It was incredibly difficult. And just as a result ofthe hard work of a lot of people from Tesla worldwide. And yes, just think about the next 12 to 18months, we'll have 3 new factories in place. Things are looking great with Giga Berlin, and we'llhave Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Full Self-Driving. There's so much to be excited about. It's reallyhard to kind of fit into this call. But the sheer amount of hardcore engineering, especially on theautonomy and the manufacturing engineering front, is mind-blowing. And then, of course, there'sBattery Day, which is coming up pretty soon."

        "paragraph": "And I think that's really going to surprise people byjust how much there is to see.So with that, thanks again for your support on our long-term mission, and we're looking forward tohaving a great journey with you to create amazing products and continue scaling it. And yes, this is-- I think I've never been more optimistic or excited about the future of Tesla and the history of thecompany. Thank you.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And I think our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, has some remarks as well.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. I want to start by thanking our employees, customers and suppliers for yoursupport over the last quarter. In particular to the Tesla team, I couldn't be more impressed with thehard work and the resiliency that you all have shown.On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter ofprofitability. This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operationsof our U.S. factories and field operations around the world. To ensure the business remains healthy,we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to personnel and noncriticalpatent projects. The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown waslargely offset by these cost savings actions, although the costs were concentrated in COGS, and thecost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses.On automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, this reduced sequentially from 20% to18.7%. This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operationalefficiency due to the various shutdowns. Despite these charges, we continue to make progressreducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai. Given the globalmacroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass through savings to customers aroundthe world on some of our products.With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $48 million ofdeferred revenue in the period. The full profit impact on our P&L is less than half of this due tocosts associated with FSD computer retrofits in the field.Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $428 million. While difficult to forecastprecisely, our best estimate of 2020 credit revenue is roughly double that of 2019.Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.In the energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit."

        "paragraph": "We remainproduction-constrained in this business and are continuing to work towards building additionalcapacity. And our solar installation business was impacted by permit office closures limitinginstallation volume.Stock-based comp increased from Q1 to Q2. This is driven almost entirely by an expense related tothe next tranche of the CEO grant as well as early vesting of the first tranche, which is reflected inSG&A within operating expenses.On cash flows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of $8.6 billion, which includedfree cash flows of over $400 million. This is a strong result on its own despite an increase in capitalexpenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin as well as movements in working capital.A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables. While our AR balance isusually about 20% of revenue, it can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors. First, overall,less than 30% of our receivables is associated with new car sales. Second, due to payment termsassociated with financing and enterprise customers, settlement time lines for certain methods ofcash payments and geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated receivablesare impacted significantly by how many cars are delivered in the final weeks and days of thequarter. Third, roughly 40% of the balance is attributed to payment terms on regulatory credit salesand statutory EV incentive programs, both of which have been increasing. Customer depositsreduced slightly as well. Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the averagedeposit per order will continue to reduce, driving down this balance.As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and closeworking capital management. This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scalingour operations and preparing for the launch of 3 new factories over the next 1.5 years."

        "paragraph": "Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much.Let's go to questions from institutional investors first. The question #1 is, as Tesla continues itsjourney towards the long-term goal of selling 20 million units per year, what are the most importantvehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next 3 to 5 years beyond Model 3, Y andthe Cybertruck: cheaper, smaller versions of 3 and Y or region-specific vehicles or anything else?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I don't think we can comment on our detailed product road map beyond what's announcedbecause I think we want to reserve that for product launches. But it would be reasonable to assumethat we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher capacity vehicle ofsome kind. These are likely things at some point. But I do think there's a long way to go with 3 andY and with Cybertruck and Semi. So it's a long way to go with those. I think we'll do the obviousthings.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The second question from institutional is, what is your vision for software at Tesla? Whatopportunities do you see from monetizing the installed base other than via FSD?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorRight now, by far, FSD is just overwhelmingly the most important thing. I think the upgrading ofthe fleet to Full-Self Driving, especially with an over-the-air software update, I mean, may go downas the biggest asset value increase in history as a step change. Maybe there's something bigger, butit certainly would be one of the biggest -- I can't think of anything bigger. So overnight, 1 million --depending exactly on when it happens and when it's allowed in various regulatory jurisdictions,you'd have like, I don't know, at least a few million cars suddenly becoming 5x more valuable orsomething like that, something like 5x higher utility. They go from like 12 hours a week of utility,something like that, that's hours of use, to 60, something like that. So everything else is pretty smallby comparison.Now when things do become Full-Self Driving, so what are people going to do in the car? Well, Iguess they're probably going to want to do productivity and entertainment of some kind. Watchmovies, play games and do work. That's in the future. Yes."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "We're already putting some games andstuff on the car, just for fun.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, we have been experimenting on that. And so FSD remains, by far and away, the biggestopportunity in the near term. But we're putting the plumbing in place to be ready to scale otherareas when the time is right. So premium connectivity subscription is something that we've put inplace. And the ability to upgrade your vehicle through the app, for example, on Acceleration Boost,or upgrading a Standard Range Model 3 to a Standard Plus, adding rear-heated seats. So these arethings that we have, and we're continuing to get feedback from the field and other things that wecan launch, and we'll trickle those in with time.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. But they're all very tiny compared with like the step change to Full Self-Driving, dependingupon how you calculate it, is probably worth at least $100,000 per car. So that's a lot of softwareyou have to sell in the App Store or whatever, yes.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThe third question is also about Autopilot. What are the most important upcoming self-drivingmilestones? And how do you think about timing?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, the actual major milestone that's happening right now is really a transition of the autonomysystem of the cars like AI, if you will, from thinking about things in, I call it like, 2.5D. It's like --think of taking like isolated pictures and doing image recognition on pictures that are harshlycorrelated in time but not very well and transitioning to kind of a 4D where it's like -- which isvideo essentially. You're thinking about the world in 3 dimensions, and the fourth dimension beingtime. So that architectural change, which has been underway for some time but has not really beenrolled out to anyone in the production fleet is what really matters for Full Self-Driving.So what we've been doing thus far has really just been with like 2D -- mostly 2D. And like I said,not well correlated in time. So it's just hard to convey just how much better a fully 4D system wouldwork -- does work."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "It's capable of things that if you just look -- looking at things as individualpictures as opposed to video like -- basically, like you could go from like individual pictures tosurround video. So it's fundamental. So the car will seem to have just like a giant improvement.We'll probably roll it out later this year. But we'll be able to do traffic lights, stop, turns, troughs,everything pretty much. And then it will be a long march of 9s, essentially, how many 9s ofreliability are okay. So it's definitely way better than human, but how much better than human doesit need to be. So that's actually going to be the real work. There's just a massive amount of workwith each kind of order of magnitude of reliability. But you'll see it happen. And if you plot thepoints on the curve, it would be kind of obvious where it's headed.AI, in general, I think, is something -- I've been saying this famous AI drum for a decade, weshould be concerned about where AI is going. And the people I see being the most wrong about AIare the ones who are very smart because they can't imagine that a computer could be way smarterthan them. That's the flaw in their logic. They're just way dumber than they think they are.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRAnd the next question from institutional investor is please may you update us on AlienDreadnought. How has your thinking evolved? And what is needed in order to get closer tofundamental physical limits?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we bring a massive amount of effort into manufacturing engineering, the machine that makesthe machine. There's probably 1,000%, maybe 10,000% more engineering required for the factorythan for the product itself. So we're certainly making progress. I mean battery and powertrainfactory, Gigafactory in Nevada is, I don't know, Alien Dreadnought version 0.5, something like that,starting to approach version 1.We're getting way better at making cars. You can see that in Giga Shanghai. You'll see that evenmore with Berlin. And we're really changing the design of the car in order to make it moremanufacturable. The fundamental architecture of Model Y will be different in Berlin. It may lookthe same, but the internals will be quite different and fundamentally more efficient architecturallythan what we've done to date. Drew, would you like to add to that?Andrew D."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. I was going to expand on that. I think part of the Alien Dreadnought concept is not justautomation but minimizing the number of process steps and complexity involved in themanufacturing system, which involves really integrating design and manufacturing across from likewhen the raw materials enter the factory to the finished goods exit. And we're learning so muchthrough doing that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Vertical integration is extremely important for this. But the supply chain -- if you put like aGPS tracker on a molecule from when it got mined to when it was in a usable product, it wouldlook insane. It would be like, wow, it went around the world like 6 times. So with verticalintegration, maybe you can only go around the world once. It would be a huge improvement, or noteven, like half of -- I think a half of -- I think if we get vertical integration, probably get you anorder of magnitude improvement. So yes. Jerome, do you want to...Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionYes. I think the focus for us is increasing CapEx efficiency. This is something that we've beenworking very hard for the past 3 years. And you can see that we can build new factories for lessamount of money and much faster. Those things go together.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. It's a better factory for less money and less time.Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionYes. Less money means less time. So that's a great advantage. And we're also reducing, and therestill is a lot, the amount of inefficiencies. We want every operation to add value to the vehicle.Value, meaning moving the items closer to their final state. So we do not want any robot that justmoves things or adding parts.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorOr a person. In fact, it's like we want to be super respectful of people's labor. If we're askingsomebody to do something, are we sure it's useful? Are we asking them to spend their time in a waythat is respectful of their time? But it's like, wow, the potential for improvement is tremendous. Andlike, I just want to be clear. Here at Tesla, we love manufacturing. It's awesome."

        "paragraph": "And I really thinkmore smart people should be working on manufacturing.Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionAnd we want more people. We can't find enough people. If people are interested in designing newlines and trying to do things different, Tesla's got a job for you. And now we've got jobseverywhere. It's not only in California. Now we've got jobs in China; in Berlin; in Austin, Texas;and in California. So there's plenty of exciting places. And all these places will do original workand challenging, meaningful work.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Absolutely. It's actually extremely exciting and fulfilling to design new production systems.And I think that for some reason, I kind of got a bad rap, especially in the U.S., for a long time. AndI think people didn't think that manufacture -- they sort of -- they thought of manufacturing it's like,oh, it's just some boring -- just making copies or whatever. But actually, there's far more opportunityfor innovation in manufacturing than in the product itself, order of magnitude. So like if there's onething that comes out of this call, it's like, hey, if you want to help us invent amazing, newmanufacturing techniques and have input into the product itself, it's not like you just get tossed theproduct and say, \"Hey, make this product,\" and it's kind of a lousy design, you get -- if you're inmanufacturing, you get to change the product design. And say, \"Hey, this product you're asking meto manufacture is dumb.\" Like, \"Great, let's fix it.\"So it has a -- if you work on manufacturing engineering, you don't just get force-fed a turdsandwich. You get to change the product design. So it's super exciting. And we evolve the lineseven after they're built. There's rapid evolution of the production system. So...Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd there's nothing more rewarding than going from 0 cars an hour to 5,000 cars a week or 1,000cars a day.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So the long-term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think, will be manufacturing.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRAnd the last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?Elon R.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, it's our biggest property, true.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. And now we can shift to retail investor questions on say.com. The first one is, Tesla Energyseems widely ignored by Wall Street despite Elon comments about growth rate exceedingautomotive. Could Tesla share more detail on calendar planned projects to help investors betterunderstand the business outlook? How disruptive is Tesla's Autobidder technology?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I can't emphasize enough, I think long term, Tesla Energy will be of roughly the same size asTesla Automotive. So I mean the energy business collectively is bigger than the automotivebusiness. So it's like how big is the energy sector? Bigger than automotive. So -- and in order toachieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think isgoing to be primarily solar and followed by wind. And those are intermittent. So you need to have alot of batteries to store the energy because the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't alwaysshine.So there's like 3 elements of the sustainable energy future: wind and solar sustainable energygeneration; battery storage; and electric transport. Those 3 things. And the mission of Tesla is toaccelerate sustainable energy.So I can't emphasize enough. The -- like yes, the battery and solar will both be enormous. And theykind of have to be in order for us to have a sustainable future. And we've got a great product roadmap on that front as well. So we're going to ship in the Megapack. It's very well received. Yes.Drew, do you want to talk about that?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. I think the Megapack has represented itself and is an integrated, rapidly deployable grid-tiedstorage battery of megawatt-hour scale. We're working with utilities, large and small, not justutilities, but also just like microgrid and project developers of all type, and building our ownprojects where it makes sense. And there's a lot of demand for the product, and we're growing theproduction rates as fast as we can for that product.And then on Autobidder, Autobidder is basically autopilot for grid-tied batteries.

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringNo, we're not doing anything like that. No. It's ensuring that the battery is doing everything it can tomanage the container dependency of the renewals -- renewables and just grid intermittency of allkinds. I mean people turn their lights on and off, power plants turn on and off, factories ramp up anddown, and batteries are great to solve those problems.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. It does grid stabilization at the millisecond level.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringExactly.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorSo it just ensures that things are super smooth. It's like a UPS, an uninterruptible power supply, of anormal size. But it just ensures that the grid has smooth sailing. And then the batteries, thecomputers like all interact with each other and make sure that they're working together to make thegrid smooth. And this can be done with the Powerwalls and the Megapacks and the Powerpacks allworking together and interacting with third-party systems as well.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Centrally or distributed, it does both. Yes. I mean we've -- yes.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI mean it's just necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. You can't plan power plants on the hourly scale in a renewable world. You need a plant -- youneed to optimize them on a minute-by-minute scale, and that's what we're doing.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at an affordable price. That's the reallimit. So that's why we're going to talk about a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is afundamental scaling constraint. And any part of that supply chain or pricing at the cell level will bethe limiting factor.

What weekly production rate is considered volumeproduction? And when does Tesla expect to reach that rate?Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionYes. So we'll start production next year, as we announced before. I'm personally very excited aboutthe project. I can't wait. We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and likely deliveringcars. But we're going to accelerate that.I want to be clear that the first few units, we will use ourselves, Tesla, to carry our own freight,probably mostly between Fremont and Reno, which is a fantastic test route. We're going to provethat we have very good reliability. I mean so far, the early units do have it, but we'll do that at alarger scale. And we have also promised some early units to some long term, very patient andsupportive customers, and we'll do that.Now we have more sales coming up in next year, as Elon just pointed out. So we can increase thediversity of the portfolio. It didn't make sense up to now to do it. But we'll be ready. And that's -- Imay be a little biased. I'm very excited about this. And we have a lot of very unique technology thatwe're always dreaming about that we will be putting into that Semi. It will be just awesome.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And just there's like 2 general classes of cell. There's like the iron phosphate and then thenickel-based. Nickel-based cells have higher energy density, so longer range. Obviously, those areneeded for something like a Semi, where every unit of mass that you add in battery pack, you haveto subtract in cargo. So it's very important to have a mass-efficient and long-range pack for fullbatteries."

        "paragraph": "However, what we're seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiencyand sort of tire efficiency, drag coefficient, like basically, all of the things that -- our HV AC, goingto a heat pump, basically our total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model 3, forexample, that we actually are comfortable having an iron phosphate battery pack in Model 3 inChina. And that will be in volume production later this year.So we think that getting a range that is in the high 200s, basically -- but we think you probably get arange of almost 300 miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch ofpowertrain and other vehicle efficiencies. And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the TeslaSemi and the other projects that require higher energy density. So -- yes. So that's like 2 supplychains that you can tap into, iron phosphate or nickel. We use very little cobalt in our systemalready, and that's -- -- that may trend to 0 along -- especially when we got nickel.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThe next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard Range version of Model Y . Nolonger office -- offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.Does this shift from smaller pack vehicles suggests that Tesla is not battery-constrained as in thepast? What are the biggest constraints now?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I'd just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel, okay?Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don't wait for nickel to go back tosome long -- some high point that you experienced some 5 years ago or whatever. Go for efficient,also environmentally friendly nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract fora long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way. Sohopefully, this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.With regard to passenger vehicles, I think the new normal for range is going to be, just in U.S. EPAterms, approximately 300 miles. So I think people will really come to expect that as some numberclose to 300 miles as normal."

        "paragraph": "That's a standard expectation because you do need to take intoaccount, like, is it very hot outside or very cold? Or are you driving up into a mountain with a fullload? And it's -- people don't want to have a -- get to their destination with like a 10 miles range.They want some reasonable margins. So I think 300 is going to be really -- or close to 300 is goingto be the new normal, close to 500 kilometers basically roughly.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThe next question on insurance. What is the holdup for Tesla insurance outside of California? Willyou release numbers from that part of the business? Will Tesla Insurance be required to participatein the Tesla ride-hailing network as a driver?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorSure.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. We're joking before the call that we get the quarterly insurance question that -- from say.comhere. We are working super hard on insurance. I'll go into a little bit more detail here than I have inthe past.Currently, we have a product in California. As I've described before, it's been quite well received.And I would largely describe it as a fairly standard insurance product with elements of it that areunique to our cars. So you can think of it as a version 1 of Tesla Insurance.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Version 0.9 is it getting at least.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFO0.9. What we're working on now is we can call it version 2, or we can call it the first version of ourtelematics product. And so really, ultimately, where we want to get to with Tesla Insurance is to beable to use the data that's captured in the car, in the driving profile of the person in the car, to beable to assess correlations and probabilities of crash and be able then to assess a premium on amonthly basis for that customer.And what makes this very exciting for us is the amount of data that is available, with the customer'spermission to use, is not available on any other product or any other vehicle in the world. So thisgives us a unique advantage in terms of information."

        "paragraph": "And we have a decision point here where wecould take the California product and replicate that into other states, or we could delay going intoadditional states and instead put more effort into the telematics side of this. And we chose the latter.And where we are now is nearly complete with the risk and cost analysis associated with the firstversion of the telematics product. We hope to be filing that in a handful of states with regulatorsvery shortly. And assuming that regulatory approvals go smoothly, we hope to have this in ahandful of states by the end of the year. And then we'll continue to file for approval in additionalstates. With regulatory approval there, we'll continue to roll this out nationwide as quickly as wecan. And then that product, as we continue to collect more data and reiterate on it, there'll beversion 2, version 3, et cetera, as we continue to refine that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean at the heart of being competitive with insurance is what is the accuracy of yourinformation. Like are you dealing with -- are you forced to assess people statistically looking in therear-view mirror? Or can you assess people individually, looking ahead with smart projections, andinform the driver that -- of how they may reduce their -- what actions they can take to reduce theirinsurance. As Zach was alluding to, it's like, okay, you're driving too fast, you're doing this or thator the other thing, it's like if you want to pay more for insurance, you can. But if you want to payless, then please don't drive so crazy. Then people can make a choice. Like, okay, they want to driveaggressively, in that case, it'll be higher insurance, or if they want -- they're more careful in theirdriving, they pay less.This was actually very helpful for us to have a feedback loop to see what is driving insuranceexpense."

        "paragraph": "A lot of it is just -- it's like a little fender bender and the net fender bender because of theway that the body collision repairs being done cost like $15,000 or something crazy, and like, well -- and then we can actually adjust the design of the car and adjust how the repair is done to actuallyhave the fundamental cost of solving that problem would be less.So this has helped us unearth a whole bunch of silly things that we were doing basically withoutrealizing it. But this is a problem, in general, with insurance, is like if the insurance is like all youcan eat, then the feedback loop for improvement is sweet. So this gives us a great feedback loop forimprovement because it's basically a fundamentally better insurance product.I'd also like to say, in the spurt of recruiting because if there's one thing I'd like to come out of thiscall, it's that a lot of great people want to join Tesla. That's the #1 thing I'd like on this call.And on the insurance front, I want to be clear. We're building a great, like a major insurancecompany. If you're interested in revolutionary insurance, please join Tesla. I would love to havesome high energy actuaries, especially. I have great respect for the actuarial profession. Your guysare great at math. Please join Tesla, especially if you want to change things and you're annoyed byhow slow the industry is. This is the place to be. We want revolutionary actuaries.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Thank you very much. And...Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSorry. So there was a second part of this question. Will Tesla Insurance be required to participate inthe Tesla ride-hailing network? And so I think I've answered this before in prior calls, but by thetime the ride-hailing network is available, we will -- Tesla Insurance coverage will be provided tofolks who are in this network. It's a different type of insurance because of the use of the car. It's notdecided whether third-party insurance versus Tesla Insurance will be required. There might be somethings we need to think through there. But Tesla Insurance, at least, will be working, working forthe ride-hailing network.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And in the interest of time, let's go to the Q&A of analysts on the line."

Just on thequarter, if you could give us an update on gross margin. Was China accretive to gross margin in thesecond quarter? And give us an idea of how far off Model Y gross margin was versus FremontModel 3?And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in-sourcing is varying byregion. You're in-sourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you're relying a lot more on the supply chainin Shanghai. What do you expect your approach to be on insourcing when you eventually open upBerlin and what your Texas factory is going to be?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Just to start with the gross margin questions. We did see progress on gross margins in China,and that was despite pricing action that was taken. The factory is still not running at full capacityyet as it continues to ramp. So we think there's a continued opportunity to optimize the coststructure there.Model Y , as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production. And despitethe inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see a pretty substantial improvement inthe Model Y margin. And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structurewill converge. They're not quite there. Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, andit's not yet at full production. And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kindof back into the math there on the relative gross margins.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory. But -- and it's continuing to do more andmore internally. But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton ofparts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from everypart of the world. And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to thecost of the vehicle. And I mean the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like 5%to 10% a month."

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I'd say it like this. The suppliers in China have been extremely competitive, possibly the mostcompetitive in the world.Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionAnd so far, we're in negotiations with -- for Berlin, and we've awarded a lot of business. Also a lotof suppliers in Germany or the rest of Europe, they are eager to support the factory in Berlin.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Well, obviously, Germany has a great automotive industry and supply chain. So actually, a tonof our suppliers are in Germany within like a few hundred kilometers of the factory."

        "paragraph": "Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystYou mentioned in the slide deck a couple of times that you were pleased with gross margin, withPTI margin progress and you expect it to achieve industry-leading operating margins over time.Maybe you could shed a little light on that. Industry-leading for luxury vendors is 8% to 10% PTI.For Porsche, smaller, at 17%. For mass market vendors, it's 5% to 8%. What do we think about?And how much, ultimately, do you believe that EV credits will contribute to that margin? Because Iknow your margin has been 5% over the last 12 months, but it's actually less than 1% excluding EVcredits. So it's a 4-point contribution right now. How do we think about ultimately what industry-leading margins are? And how much of that you think is coming from EV credits, regulatorycredits? And I have a follow-up, please.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. I've mentioned this before in terms of regulatory credit. We manage the business -- or saiddifferently, we don't manage the business with the assumption that regulatory credits will contributein a significant way to the future. I do expect regulatory credit revenue to double in 2020 relative to2019, and it will continue for some period of time. But eventually, the stream of regulatory creditswill reduce.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean it's worth noting that we're -- buyers of our car in the U.S. received 0 federal tax credit.Whereas many of our competitors are like, they get a $7,500 fed tax credit. And yet our sales havecontinued to do well. Yes.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce, manufacture and distributeour cars. That cost curve even for mature products like the S and the X continues to come down, aswe work on that, Model 3, which is our second most mature product, that continues to come down.You then layer on top of that, as Elon was discussing earlier, the potential for software-basedrevenue, particularly Full Self-Driving. There's the revenue recognition portion of that, that we havetoday. That will expand as we release more features."

    {
        "paragraph": "And then you can layer on top of that in thefuture our revenue from the ride-hailing network.Operating expenses continue to come down and become more efficient as a percentage of revenue.There's still incredible opportunity there that we're working on, particularly on how customersinteract with the company from sales and service and what their flow is and how we get cars tothem. So we continue to see efficiencies there. So in the medium term here, what our modelingshows is in the low-teens operating margin level. And I think there continues to drive -- theopportunity to drive that up.So I hear your point on the 5% and the 1%. We're on a bit of a journey here, and we're continuing tobe [partners].A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystAnd if I could just follow up, Elon, you've talked a lot about the mission of the company in -- andreally trying to drive EV adoption globally. So how do you think about that trade-off betweendriving towards industry-leading profitability, yet trying to make your cars more affordable andbroader? It feels like, historically, you've always picked the path of, I'd rather drive more growthand more adoption because ultimately, that's the mission of the company. And we even saw it a littlebit this quarter with price reductions. You could have probably kept price where it is, sold someunits and had better profits, but that's been an ongoing choice that Tesla, as a company, has made.So how do you personally think about that trade-off between -- even if you were to get to industry-leading margins, wouldn't you be inclined to give more of that back to drive greater adoption morequickly?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I think we actually achieved both when you factor in autonomy. I think we can go waybeyond industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people and potentiallyalmost everyone when you're factoring in autonomy. That was really a mega game changer, gigagame changer. Yes. But I mean it is important for people to distinguish between 2 things. There'svalue for money that our product has, and then there's affordability. And even if you rail value formoney and have value for money like infinite, if people don't have enough -- if people do not haveenough money in their bank accounts to buy the car, they simply cannot."

    {
        "paragraph": "So then you used -- havethis like awesome thing that nobody can buy.So it is important to make the car affordable. I think we will not succeed in our mission if we do notmake cars affordable. Like the thing that bugs me the most about where we are right now is that ourcars are not affordable enough. We need to fix that. So we are making progress in that regard, justsort of steadily gaining progress. So yes, we need to not go bankrupt. Obviously, that's importantbecause we'll fail in our mission. But we're not trying to be super profitable either. Obviously, we'relike -- profitability is like 1% or something, 1% or 2%. It's not crazy.Last quarter, it was only like 0.1%. So we want to be profitable. Like I think just we want to be likeslightly profitable and maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible. That's whatwe're trying to achieve."

        "paragraph": "Our next question will come from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystCould you please characterize the current near-term demand environment for your vehicles? Theseare obviously unusual times. I think back in Q1, you had indicated record backlog, I guess, at thebeginning of this past quarter. I haven't seen any specific comments about new orders or backlog inthe release today. So can you give us some color?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorDemand is not our problem. Definitely not. We do have some production supply chain challengeswe're trying to solve right now. For example, the Model Y rear body casting, obviously, because it'snew technology, it's been tricky to maintain rates and keep growing the rate for Model Y casting,which is -- it's a 2-piece casting with a bunch -- and there's about half a dozen other parts that areadded on. That will transition to a 1-piece casting. In fact, I'm super excited about this. We're goingto have a -- the world's biggest casting press is getting assembled right now actually in Fremont forthe Model Y rear body casting. It's enormous and looks awesome. So it's -- look, the things that aretroubling us right now are not demand, but they are just a bunch of firefighting on supply chain andproduction issues.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystOkay. So to put it...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Don't worry about demand. That's not the issue.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystOkay. So when you're saying you're achieving 500,000 deliveries has become more difficult, was itreally just a function of the recent shutdowns and some of these supply dynamics?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. It's not an issue with demand. It's really just a production issue. It's been pretty hard whenyou've got like a global supply chain. And it's kind of whatever the most effective part of that globalsupply chain is, that sets your rate. The -- I mean the number of rabbits we've had to pull out of ahat for supply chain is insane. The team has done an amazing job."

And I was hopingyou could clarify the scope of the Berlin plant you're building right now, will there be batterycapacity consistent with the amount of assembly volume you expect to come out of Berlin? And ifnot, will you be able to source your battery requirements out of Europe? Or will you have to importbatteries from outside Europe to ensure production in Berlin?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorOkay. We can't say too much about this except that there will be local cell production and that willserve the needs of the Berlin factory. Drew, is there anything that...Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringI mean, no, that's straightforward enough. I think just adding to what you said earlier about talentand people, like the same goes in all areas of cell, supply chain, manufacturing materials, design,we are solving this problem. And we -- we're treating it like any other problem that we have solved.We will solve this problem, and we want talented people to join us as we solve this problem.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And like so my biggest concern for getting our talented people is probably Berlin because thelabor mobility in Europe is not -- is low. I would recommend changing this. Like somebody whowants to leave and join another company, sometimes they have to spend 6 months on garden leave.It's called garden, hanging out in the garden basically. And like this is not a good use of people'stime.
