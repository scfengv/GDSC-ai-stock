        "paragraph": "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for your patience. You've joined the Tesla Q2 2019Financial Results and Q&A Webcast. As a reminder, this conference may berecorded.I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Senior Director of Investor Relations, MartinViecha. Sir, you may begin.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Latif, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2019 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of otherexecutives.Our Q3 results were announced at about 1:45 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter we published atthe same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So last quarter, we delivered more than 95,000 vehicles, which is a record for Tesla. Putthat in perspective, it's nearly an 80% increase in deliveries compared to the second quarter of lastyear. I think it's sometimes hard for people to appreciate when you have a large manufactured itemwith a complex global supply chain just how difficult that is. I'm incredibly proud of the Tesla teamfor being able to do that.I think this level of growth is possibly unprecedented. It might be the fastest that any large complexmanufactured item has grown in history. So just, I think, really great work by the Tesla team toachieve that outcome, and we expect growth to continue in the future at -- for several years to comeat the 50% to 100% level. So as I said, I think that is not well appreciated how the quotas grow atthat rate.But achieving record number of deliveries is an important milestone and shows the rapid progresswe've made in managing a global logistics and delivery operation at high volume. And as I said, allof this was achieved thanks to the tremendous hard work of the entire Tesla team.Model 3 is once again the best-selling premium vehicle in the U.S., outselling all of its gas-powered equivalents combined."

        "paragraph": "In Europe, Model 3 is approaching sales levels of its established premiumcompetitors, and it was awarded a 5-star rating from Euro NCAP earlier this month. This is inaddition to Model 3 receiving an overall 5-star rating in the U.S. from NHTSA and -- includingearning 5 stars in every category and subcategory and achieving the lowest probability of injury ofany vehicle ever tested.Motor Trend also recently selected Model S as the best vehicle they have ever tested in their 70-year history across all other cars. So Motor Trend, which is arguably the leading authority inevaluating vehicles, the Motor Trend Car of the Year is the most coveted award. It's prettyincredible that they would say that Model S in their entire 70-year history is the best vehicle theyhave ever evaluated. This is despite Tesla not buying any advertising in Motor Trend, and it speaksto their journalistic integrity. That's something special.So -- and since the vehicle that they evaluated, we've actually made -- committed to advancementsof both Model S and Model X, including our recent update of a new suspension with activedamping capability and an all-new drivetrain that's capable of a 370-mile range in the Model S anda 325-mile range in the Model X. We've also issued numerous software updates and improvementsthat have made Model S and Model X faster, safer and added dozens of new features. Just likeModel 3, Model S and X have the hardware needed for future full self-driving capability.As we look ahead to the rest of the year and into 2020, we remain focused on launching newvehicle and energy programs, further expanding on manufacturing operations and continuing toimprove customer service. We remain focused on international expansion because local productionis essential to being cost-competitive. By the end of this year, we will -- we expect to be producingModel 3s in volume out of Gigafactory Shanghai. And as you can see from the photos in ourquarterly letter, the equipment installation there is progressing well. We also have to finalize alocation for our European Gigafactory before the end of the year.Here in Fremont, preparations for Model Y production have already begun. Since Model Y has highcomponent overlap with Model 3, it should be -- we expect it to be a lot easier to ramp. It'ssomething in the order of 3/4 of all the parts are common between Model 3 and Model Y ."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "And weexpect many manufacturing costs for Model Y , despite additional content, to be approximately thesame as Model 3.This quarter, we opened 25 new service locations and added more than 100 Mobile Service vehiclesto our fleet. And although our fleets have a total -- Tesla fleet size has doubled in the past 12months, which is again just kind of a crazy thing to consider that Tesla is almost doubling allcumulative production every year. This is a totally mad thing to make as many cars in a year aswe've made in our entire history and to have that be an ongoing trend, I think it's difficult for peopleto really feel an exponential. We didn't evolve to feel an exponential. We can feel a linear, but wecan only understand an exponential at a cognitive level.But Tesla is expanding at an exponential rate. And in fact, if you look at the Tesla cumulativedeliveries chart like year-over-year cumulative deliveries, it's about the cleanest exponential graphI've ever seen. So obviously, if that trend continues, the results, I think, are going to be prettyamazing. And I think that will continue.So we've been able to improve service considerably. You can imagine that if -- obviously, if we'redoubling our fleet every year, managing service is quite difficult. It's like a total -- because servicescales as not just with new production but as the total fleet scales, service needs to scale. And wewant to scale service in a way that's sensible from a cost standpoint. But it's really quite a difficultchallenge to scale.Nonetheless, we've made massive improvements in service, especially in parts waiting -- time towait for parts and collision repair. And we've in-sourced a great deal of the collision repairactivities, which has had, I think, quite a good effect on customer happiness. And this will continuein the months to come.So it's a very important milestone. I think we believe Tesla has -- is now at the point of being self-funding, and we expect to be cash flow -- free cash flow positive in future quarters with the possibletemporary exceptions around the launch and ramp of new product. From a profitability standpoint,we expect to be probably around breakeven this quarter and profitable next quarter. So that's -- I feelpretty confident about that.And then in terms of deliveries, we expect deliveries to be between 360,000 and 400,000."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "Weexpect production to be a slightly higher number than that and demand to be a slightly highernumber than that. So people often confuse deliveries, production and orders for Tesla, and they'reactually 3 different numbers. So yes, you obviously cannot deliver more than you make, and sotypically, we will make more than we deliver. And then demand generation activities kind of movein kind of like -- to get together with production like it doesn't make sense to put a lot of effort intodemand generation if production can't meet the demand.And likewise -- so what tends to happen is that we'll solve the production issues, then say, okay, weneed to increase demand -- address demand then we may increase production, then increasedemand. And like I truly get caught up in these details a lot, but if you look at the actual results, likeI said, look at cumulative deliveries over time for Tesla, cleanest exponential we've ever seen,extrapolate that curve.So there's a tremendous amount to be excited about at Tesla, and we'll have more share in thecoming weeks and months. Zach, is there anything you'd like to say about our results?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, sure. And thanks, Elon. A few things I want to highlight before moving into the Q&A. Overall,Q2 was a strong quarter for Tesla. I'm extremely proud of the team for the progress we've made.We've achieved record vehicle production and delivery, record storage production and deployment,record services and other revenue with a corresponding reduced loss. As we've mentioned a fewtimes, we stabilized international logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes. And we sawgross margin improvement in nearly every aspect of the business, adjusting for the impact ofregulatory credit revenue.As a result of these accomplishments, we once again achieved strong free cash flows, which is onlypartially attributed to working capital benefits. We also successfully raised roughly $2.4 billion innet proceeds in May. Thus, we exited the quarter with $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, thehighest in our history. Our net loss reduced significantly relative to Q1, aided by higher volumes inprogress on cost efficiencies.A few things to note. There's $117 million within operating expenses for restructuring. We had asequential reduction of $104 million related to regulatory credit, which is inherently lumpy. And inour other income line, we saw a $66 million reduction."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "This is nearly entirely due to foreignexchange, which we don't hedge.GAAP automotive gross margin only reduced slightly despite the reduction in credit revenue andexpected reductions in our vehicle average selling prices. Adjusting for the impact of credits,automotive gross margin improved materially. For Model S and Model X, ASPs are impacted bypricing actions applied to inventory of vehicles built prior to the launch of our powertrain andsuspension upgrades in April, the majority of which were sold and delivered in Q2.For Model 3, global ASPs stabilized during the quarter at roughly $50,000, a sequential reduction,yet gross profit per Model 3 improved, representing the continued success of our cost managementefforts. Note that we continue to defer a significant portion of revenue associated with full self-driving, which will be recognized in future periods upon the release of additional features.Operating expenses, net of restructuring, continues to improve as well despite the increases involume, reflecting the immense focus on improving our operating efficiency. And while operatingexpenses and capital expenses may appear to be unnaturally low this quarter, that's not the case.Rather, these reflect continued progress on cost efficiency and ability to scale our core technologiesand processes.If we take a step back here, I think it's important to remember that Tesla is on a long-term journey,and it's difficult to see the full picture looking quarter-to-quarter. We committed that Model 3 willbe a transformative product, both for the industry and our business. 3 years ago, we unveiled theModel 3. 2 years ago, we brought the product to market. 1 year ago, we demonstrated our ability tobuild the Model 3 at high rate.So far this year, we've demonstrated our ability to manage global deliveries and logistics at a higherrate, but the most important thing is that we've demonstrated our ability to generate significantorganic demand as nearly all orders generated in Q2 were nonreservation holders. And thus far inQ3, our order pacing is ahead of where we were at this point in Q2. And as we noted in our Q2production and delivery release, our order backlog increased over the course of Q2.Ultimately, the Model 3 is accomplishing what our business needs it to do. It expanded our salesand customer base, enabling us to generate cash we need to reinvest."

        "paragraph": "In the process, we'veappropriately managed our operating expenses and have reduced the cost of running the business.This is critically important because I feel as though we've broken through a baseline fixed costbarrier enabled by the success of the Model 3 business.With continued focus on execution and cost management, the next 12 to 18 months should be themost exciting yet. During this time, we believe that Gigafactory Shanghai will be producing atscale. Model Y will be in production, addressing the most popular vehicle segment. Our EuropeanGigafactory will be well underway. Our autonomous driving feature suite will continue to develop.Energy products business will grow and maybe a few other things along the way.And while there's inherent risk in any large and ambitious set of projects, our intent is to grow andinvest as fast as we can afford to. With the cash we have on hand and the stabilization of Model 3across the key areas as I've noted, we believe we're in great shape for this next phase of growth.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. Now let's start taking some first questions -- sorry about that. Sorry. Goahead.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So an important update is that J.B. Straubel, our Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer,will be transitioning to a senior adviser from the CTO role. And Drew Baglino will be taking overmost of J.B.'s responsibilities. I'd like to thank J.B. for his fundamental role in creating and buildingTesla. Thank you, J.B.Jeffrey B. Straubel - Tesla, Inc. - CTO & Senior AdvisorThanks, Elon.Elon R.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Great. I think we'll go ahead with some questions now.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. So we have some first questions from our retail shareholders from say.com."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRAnd the first question is it has been stated that Tesla is supply constrained not demand constrained.Can you help us shed some light on why Tesla is lowering car cost if supply is constrained?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorSure. There's a number of things to consider here. The -- there's really 2 key dimensions fordemand. There's value for money, and then there's affordability. Obviously, if somebody simplydoes not have enough money to buy the car, it doesn't matter how much the -- how good the valuefor money is. You can have infinite value for money, but if someone does not have the funds to buythe car, they simply can't get it. So it's very important to parse those 2, and I think there's like --there's tremendous amount of desire to buy our cars, but people -- obviously, if they don't haveenough money to buy them, they cannot. So we have to make the cars more affordable.And effectively back in the U.S., our cars got almost $2,000 more expensive with the expiry of thetax credit on July 1 -- or the partial expiry. And we only dropped the price of the Standard RangePlus Model 3 by $1,000 -- or actually -- yes, by $1,000. So the base Model 3 actually got $1,000more expensive, which seemed like a reasonable compromise. So that's essentially what I mean. Wefeel like this is sometimes just have these sort of pretty absurd notions like if demand is high, youcan't just charge any price. Like you cannot charge any price. I think making our cars moreaffordable is also fundamentally part of the Tesla mission. So yes. Is there anything you want toadd?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, I'll just add to that. I agree completely. What I'll add is that, generally speaking, within theModel 3 lineup, the pricing adjustments for our higher-churn cars was slightly more than that forthe Standard Plus. So we'll see how the data plays out on this as we take in more orders, but theexpectation is that our mix will move towards higher trim to some extent offsetting some of theASP adjustments from the pricing changes."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "And one other thing I'll add is that we are focusing on acouple of markets as well to target and to identify some of our sales, and so some of our pricingadjustments reflect those elements of that strategy.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Essentially, we expect average selling prices to be the same within a few percentage points.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOThat's correct.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOGenerally on ASP, as we noted in the letter, it was roughly, even over the course of the quarter,stabilized around $50,000. And we have good visibility into where our ASPs are going based onorder data. And so that gives us 1 to 2 months of lead as to where our actual recognized ASPs willbe. And so I would expect some adjustment to our Model 3 ASPs as a result of this pricing change,but the trim mix will offset some of that. And we continue to make great progress on costefficiencies. And so overall in net, our expectation is that the Model 3 gross margin will continue togrow.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. On the gross margin point, like the full self-driving is just an extremely important part of themargin calculation, and the features for full self-driving are -- only a portion of them have rolledout. So the revenue recognition on the full self-driving option is limited at first until those featuresroll out. And also, the demand for the full self-driving package is limited because the features aremostly prospective instead of current. But as those features roll out, I would expect the take rate forfull self-driving to increase significantly as well as the recognition -- revenue recognition of fullself-driving to obviously match the rollout of the product. So the gross margin over time will bereally quite compelling when factoring in the full self-driving option, which is, yes, accounted to$7,000 in mid-August. And that number will increase over time.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThe second question is many of us who follow Tesla closely are incredibly excited about Batteryand Powertrain Investor Day and its technology implications. Can you provide us any more detailon when this will be and what will be covered?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc."

The timing for this probably is about 6 months, like maybe February or March next year,show and tell.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRGreat. Thank you very much. The next question is you stated on the Q4 2018 earnings call thatcustomer service was a personal priority for 2019. Can you update us on what has been done to dateto ensure that all owners are receiving an industry-leading customer experience?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorSure. I meet with the service team multiple times a week and get daily updates on the reliability ofthe vehicle. We -- the best service, of course, is no service. Like that's the vehicle just -- reliabilityand quality being so good that service is rarely required. That's what the main goal is like, eliminatethe need for service. Then in terms of increasing service resources, we're opening service centers asfast as we can and have already opened 25 new service locations this quarter, and that will increase-- the rate of service center opening will increase dramatically in through the course of this year aswell as more Mobile Service. Mobile Service is really great because it's like we just come to youand fix the car wherever you are. And it's hard to beat that for convenience. For parts delivery,we've made massive improvement to logistics for getting parts to service centers. Hey, Jerome, doyou want to -- Jerome is helping to manage the service -- global service and...Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionYes. As you pointed out, the best service is no service. So we're trying to continue improving thequality of the cars. And we track this daily, and fewer and fewer service visits are required from themost recent cars that we're building. So we're on a good trend there. We also need a lot fewer workto finish the cars in the factory. Besides that, we stock way many more parts in all the servicecenters, and we ship everything same day pretty much so that people don't have to wait for cars --for parts. And we accelerate service, and we increase capacity."

I'm halfway expecting some headlines tomorrow of Tesla'sgot too much cash on the balance sheet. I was wondering if you could update us on GigafactoryChina. Don't have a great sense of what delivery volumes in China are for Model 3 at the moment.Some sources are around maybe 3,000 or 4,000 per month.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystI was wondering if you can comment about whether you felt that Q2 benefited from consumers inthe U.S. sort of rushing out to buy Model 3s in advance of the declining federal tax credit, aphenomenon that you sort of saw in Q4. And part of the reason I ask is, at least by my analysis, itlooks like maybe 70% of the Model 3s sold in the quarter were in the U.S., which is sort of higherthan your normalized percentage of U.S. sales. And so do you feel that, that phenomenon may haveoccurred in Q2? And are you still confident that Q3 deliveries can improve sequentially? Andbeyond the data point that you provided on the call that the orders quarter data are better than lastquarter. Is there anything else you can point to that provides that confidence?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think we'll -- demand in Q3 will exceed Q2. It has thus far, and I think we'll see someacceleration of that. And then I think Q4 will be, I think, very strong. So we expect like quarter-over-quarter improvements. I think Q1 next year will be tough. I think Q3 and 4 will be good. Q1will be tough. Q2 will be not as bad but still tough. And then I would say like Q3 and Q4 next yearwill be incredible.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Just to add on the tax credit step-down, so the step-down from Q2 to Q3 was significantlylower than the step-down from Q4 to Q1. It's also important to keep in mind that there's seasonalityin the auto business in Q1, which also is part of the impact. But generally speaking, our order ratesso far this quarter is higher than where we were at this point in Q2, and we haven't seen a significantimpact on U.S.-based orders as a result of the step-down.A.M.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorActually, we were just talking about this earlier today. We're not quite sure ourselves. I think there'ssome cannibalization. In fact, there may be false expectation in the market that there's like some bigoverhaul coming for S and X, which then cause people to hesitate to buy if they think there's somelike radical redesign coming, which is why I've emphasized publicly that this is not the case. TheModel S and X today are radically better than the ones that -- when we first started production,especially S, like I say, like 2013 or 2012 Model S compared to today's Model S, night and day. Infact, I still run into people I knew who have like 2013 Model S, and they think it hasn't changed.And I'm like it is dramatically better in every way.But we don't do model years. We just roll in improvements as they come. So I think there is maybea communications issue where people don't realize just how much better the S and X are today thanwhen we first started. And we actually want to address that communications issue and just get abetter understanding, and they're -- from the front lines like what -- demand should be higher for Sand X than it is, and we'll get to the bottom of it and fix it."

Just wondering, is the updated one, is thatsuggesting that that's no longer in play for the year? Or kind of what are the implications withtoday's update?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, if you factor in the full self-driving option, I think it is in play for the year. We just need to getthe features done, make sure they're great, roll them out and recognize revenue and increase the takerate on full self-driving. But also for the existing fleet, there's a very significant opportunity toupgrade the existing fleet to full self-driving since most of the fleet has not purchased this optionyet. So there's a significant margin potential for the existing fleet to upgrade to full self-driving,which most of the fleet can. So yes, absolutely, I think like, long term, we are talking 25%, 30%.Not -- long term meaning like a year. Long term like in Tesla vernacular. That 30% gross margin is,I think, quite likely.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. We continue to take significant costs out of the Model 3 in particular as well, and Jerome cancomment further on this. But every week -- nearly every week, we hit record lows on labor contentto build the vehicle. And we saw an ASP adjustment reduction in Model 3 from Q1 to Q2, yet thegross profit on the vehicle expanded, attributed to the cost reduction efforts that are underway.Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionOur labor costs are more than 50% reduction in 1 year. Yes, it's progressing every quarter.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, it's worth like -- so what the labor hours were quarter-over-quarter?Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionReduced in half, yes, since Q3 last year. But it's also all the (inaudible) the spares. The scrap isreduced to pretty much nothing, reduced 90% year-over-year. Spares reduced more than half also.So our goal is to make the cars more affordable, and so we're pushing every day, yes."

And is that something that you're thinking about?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we are reconfiguring the floorspace in Fremont, and there's like quite a lot of factory spacethat's currently taken up with the S/X parts warehousing, parts for the S/X line. And we don't reallyneed that. So that's where we're putting a lot of the Model Y activity. Jerome, do you want to...Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionYes, where we're improving the material delivery for S and X just like we have done for Model 3,we've seen some radical improvements. We reduced production part warehousing costs by, again,90%, 9-0, since Q3 last year. And so we're making a lot of room. We're much more efficient withparts delivery. It helps that we're increasing production actually. And so that space that we'vecleared out, I'm looking at it right now, in Fremont, we're just going to put Model Y stuff in there.So if you visit the factory from, I would say, every 6 months, you'd have a hard time recognizingand finding your way, yes. It's constantly changing and evolving, yes.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Just like I said, what's interesting about this factory is -- both Fremont and Giga, is like just therate of improvement, which is not slowing down, has been incredible. It's like -- you're just like youcan feel it and see it.Joseph Amil Osha - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Research AnalystAnd just as a follow-on then, could we see you manage to make 8,000 -- 7,500, 8,000 Model 3s inFremont by the end of the year, you think?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean I feel confident. It's -- let's just say that the trend is very clearly towards being able toget to 10,000 vehicles a week, of which that would be -- there is -- rough number is like 8,300 to8,600 Model 3s and the balance in S and X."

You're not disclosing theZEV piece anymore but just a couple questions on this. First, how can we think -- is there anyquarterly cadence to think about this? And then what's the composition of this? Is this going purelyto European OEMs? There's obviously one automaker that you've agreed with. I don't know if thereare any others that you're looking at. And lastly, to what extent can you -- or are you willing tosacrifice pricing in Europe to sell higher volumes to generate more reg credits? And are you havingdiscussions with other automakers on this front?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorZach?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. On your question about the cadence of regulatory credits. It is -- generally, as I've commentedin the past, we expect regulatory credits to become a more meaningful part of our business. On aquarter-to-quarter basis, it's very difficult to forecast them. As you saw from Q1 to Q2, thatdeclined. And so as you model regulatory credits in Q3, I would not expect a significant increase inregulatory credits, although it's hard to forecast exactly.The regulatory credits composition is a mixture of these particular deals that are onetime. There'salso some that are production-based over time. The production-based ones are easier to forecastbecause it's based on cars that we build, and we get an offset to that way. The deal-specific ones arelumpier, which makes it more difficult.And then your final question was on does it make sense to sacrifice pricing to drive regulatorycredit in certain markets. It might. I'm not sure if we've specifically gone into the details of that. Butgenerally, we're selling cars in markets at the prices we think are appropriate, and the regulatorycredit is something that traditional -- we generally try not to run the business based on regulatorycredit revenue.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThe regulatory credit is like -- I mean it's a relatively small part of the equation for Tesla."

        "paragraph": "And the --I think the ZEV credit situation, I think really needs reform because the market for ZEV credits isnegligible.Now some of what's happening here is the other manufacturers are kind of like waiting to see howtheir EV sales do before buying any credits from Tesla. And so it kind of depends on how that goes.If they sell more EVs, then there's not really a need to do a deal with Tesla. And if they sell fewer,then there is."

Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior AnalystCan you walk us through the plan for battery sourcing in China? How many -- how much of thesupply is going to come from internally produced batteries? How much is coming from externally?And what's your expectation around cost per watt hours as you start to ramp?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI mean I don't know if we want to talk about the details of battery supply, but we believe we have agood handle on -- we don't expect to be cell-constrained in China for the next year. I don't know.Drew, what do you think?Drew Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - Former VP of TechnologyYes. That's what our plan looks like right now. In terms of internal versus external, I think weshould wait until we have our discussion early next year. But yes, we have agreements in place withall the -- we're good for the next year, as you said, Elon.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean I think we probably need to like just do like a reset like -- I'm not saying master planpart 3, but it's really like, to some degree, the Battery Day will be kind of like master plan part 3,which is like, okay, how we get from kind of in the tens of gigawatt hours per year to multipleterawatt hours per year. That's a pretty giant-scale increase. And so yes, it's an increase of sort ofroughly 100. Like if we're at 28 gigawatt hours right now -- well, actually, there is more than thatwhen you count the factories in Japan. So call it like a little over 30 to 35 or something like that.And how do we get to like 2 terawatt hours a year? (inaudible) 19 increase.Drew Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - Former VP of TechnologyThat's the way you have to think about it because that's what we need to do.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. In order to really make fundamental shift in the world's energy usage and reallytransform things to a sustainable energy future, if you're not in the terawatt hour range, it's like it's anice news story, but it's not fundamentally changing the energy equation.Colin William Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co."

        "paragraph": "Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior AnalystOkay. And can I have a follow-up question around Model S and Model X saturation? Obviously,you guys have some ideas around how big that market is. How should we be thinking aboutsustainable volumes and pricing on those volumes? Obviously, we're seeing some lower numbershere, and I think that's a core element of what's going on with the story that as we see pricing dropand volumes drop, what are the right numbers to think about for you guys from a planningstandpoint in terms of sell-through on both the Model S and Model X?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think it's probably a bit too much focus on S and X. And the S and X are -- they are nice, butthey're not -- and I think it's like without them, we couldn't spell sexy. So like the main reason --well, not the main reason, but a reason is we want to keep spelling sexy. So that's -- not that I like --that is a reason, I should say, not the main reason to keep going with S and X.But the story for Tesla future is fundamentally Model 3 and Model Y . And I think -- so like myguess is like long-term sales of -- long-term meaning couple years type thing, the demand for --sales demand for 3 is like on order of 0.75 million units a year, and it's probably 1.25 million units ayear for Model Y . So combined, it's like maybe 2 million from those 2 vehicles alone. And then S/Xis like maybe 80,000 to 100,000 a year. So it's like 4% or 5% of the volume of 3 and Y . And thenyou throw like a truck in there, pickup truck and till the semi, it just gets smaller and smaller. Sothey are great products, but they are -- from a volume standpoint, they're not all that important inthe long term."

        "paragraph": "The next question comes from Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureI'd like to ask you, Elon, about distribution. So you made like -- you guys made a big change at thebeginning of the year, going from like an almost 100% online distribution model. You tried to pushback on test drive and get people to buy the car, try it and return it if they don't like it. So could yougive us an update on how it is progressing? Do you see this start becoming mostly like an onlinedistribution -- following an online distribution model? And I saw you opened 25 new retaillocations in the quarter. So how do you see your retail footprint evolving over time?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorAs I said, we opened 25 service locations. I think really what we find is that the word of mouth forTesla is incredibly good. So once there's an increase of customers in a particular area, they love thecars and they talk to all their friends about it. And that's really what drives sales. So if you think oflike a retail location is kind of like a viral seed in an area. It would grow organically by itself, butthe retail location is actually is like a viral seed. It's not that -- they aren't needed. They're like anaccelerant.But what is needed for sales in any given area, and I'd say this worldwide, frequently we've beentold like this country is different or that country is different. I'm like people around the world prettymuch want the same thing so -- in my experience. But they have to have a service location that'sconvenient. So it can't be like you've got to drive 5 hours to a service location. You have to haveservice. You have to have supercharging and charging all sorted out. You've got to have goodconsumer financing. And then the price must make sense. And any place where those 4 things aretrue, our sales are great. So we're rolling out service centers like crazy. Service centers are the keyto sales, not the retail locations.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, and we're going city by city on the service center point. We're looking at where our populationsare of existing customers."

        "paragraph": "We're mapping driving time from the customers to the service centersinclusive of traffic to improve densification of our service centers in the locations in which ourcustomers currently reside. We do have areas that are underrepresented for service centers wherethe drive time is too long or there are populations don't have appropriate access to charging in theservice centers. And we're working as fast as we can to get places up and running in those areas. Soit's very systematically being mapped out with a focus on service and supercharging as opposed to aretail presence.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Supercharging is incredibly important. You can't just have like 80% of the routes thatsomebody wants to take. You need 100% of the routes because a car is like -- it's really freedom totravel. Anything that inhibits freedom to travel impairs the fundamental value of the product.Drew Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - Former VP of TechnologyOr perceived.Elon R.

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets.Joseph Robert Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - AnalystSo Elon, you mentioned the importance of full self-driving for gross margin. You've also mentionedthe importance of China. Do you expect to be able to offer the full self-driving suite that you plan tooffer in the U.S. and China, and I guess even in Europe where they've been also a little bit tougheron regulating?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. We expect to be able to offer full self-driving actually everywhere except EU because there'sjust some committee rules that were put in place years ago that need to be changed. It's up -- from atechnical standpoint, it's very doable, but we just need to work through the regulatory committees toget the regulatory approvals and rules changed. It's just -- it all just takes a bit longer than in otherplaces. But I think we'll see a lot of pressure from our customers in Europe to have these ruleschanged so they can have access to full self-driving. And I think at the end of the day, the regulatorswill answer to the public. So I think it's just a temporary thing, and it's quite specific to EU rules.And we're just not present really when those rules were drafted. So that's what's got put in place.But they're making a ton of sense, but we just got to work through the process to change them.Joseph Robert Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - AnalystOkay. And then the second question is you mentioned service a number of times. There's obviouslybeen some, I think, growing frustration with owners. And you mentioned parts availability, andyou've issued the dealership model. But I guess how do you plan on increasing parts availabilitywithout the corresponding working capital commitment that would be required as the fleetcontinues to grow?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorIt's actually just taking the parts that were stored in a bunch of warehouses and just moving them tothe service centers. And the thing that makes sense is, I think, to have the service centers where theparts are kind of all on the wall, and it's like a supermarket. Like you always know where the CocoaPuffs are, and you just go meet there and go to grab it. And then you just replenish the shelves withparts."

You just go take it offshelf and put it on the car. We really want to get to not merely same-day service but same hour. Sortof like Jiffy Lube but applied generally to service.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. And specifically on the working capital piece of this, we actually have a significant amount ofservice parts inventory. The challenge is it's not just at the service centers. And so a lot of the lagthat is experienced is we have to get the part from the distribution center to the service center. Andso by moving -- by localizing the parts, I don't expect that to be a large working capital drain on thecompany. It might actually be the reverse where we don't need to store as many potentially.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And also just having parts, if I may add, if we made them internally or if they're made at asupplier, just sending them directly to the service center instead of like having them go through abunch of distribution outlets. In fact, like when I was in China on my last trip, I was like asking theChina team, \"Hey, is there anything silly that we're doing that we should fix?\" And they said, \"Yes,well, several of the parts that require replacement are literally made in China, and then we end upshipping them to New Jersey and then back to China. And could we please just ship them likeliterally across the road?\" And I'm like, yes, no problem. There's always like crazy things thathappen, if you're like -- if you have a 45,000-person company and then just kind of basically stopdoing silly things. It's, yes, a lot of what is needed for improvement.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOAnd as the scale of the business increases, the economics of localization of things like partsdistribution make a lot more sense, whereas in the past, when the company was smaller, havingcentralized centers was easier from a cost perspective."
