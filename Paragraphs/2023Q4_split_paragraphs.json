        "paragraph": "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast. My name isMartin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and anumber of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in theupdate deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some operating remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you. So the Tesla team did an incredible job in 2023. We achieved record production anddeliveries of about 1.8 million vehicles, in line with our official guidance. And in Q4, we wereproducing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost 2 million cars a year. This is really aphenomenal achievement.Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made 560,000 cars. This is a record. In fact, it's thehighest output of automotive plant in North America. And people are often surprised that thehighest output factory -- car factory in North America is in the San Francisco Bay Area. It's a littlecounterintuitive perhaps.And the -- it's really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area. What would have been arun-down strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas. Think about that. It wasderelict when we got it, and now it's the most productive plant in this entire part of the world. Andit's enriched the community in so many different ways. It's really a gem. So I'm super proud of thepeople that work there.Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted, and the best-selling vehicle of anykind, not just electric vehicles, with over 1.2 million units delivered. The Energy Storage businessdelivered nearly 15 gigawatt hours of batteries in 2023 compared to 6.5 gigawatt hours the yearbefore, so tremendous year-over-year growth, triple digits. And yes, I think we'll continue to seevery strong growth in storage as predicted."

        "paragraph": "I said for many years that the storage business will growmuch faster than the car business, and it is doing that.Free cash flow remained strong at $4.4 billion in 2023 in spite of record spending on futureprojects. So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D.This brings us to 2024. There's a lot to look forward to in 2024. Tesla is currently between 2 majorgrowth waves. We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full self-driving and other projects, is executed as well as possible. For fullself-driving, we've released version 12, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to priorversions. This is end-to-end artificial intelligence. So [nothing but] nets basically, photons in andcontrols out.And it really is quite a profound difference. This is currently just with employees and a fewcustomers, but we will be rolling out to all who -- all those -- all customers in U.S. who request fullself-driving in the weeks to come. That's over 400,000 vehicles in North America.So this is the first time AI has been used not just for object perception but for pathfinding andvehicle controls. We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets. It's really quiteremarkable.So as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference.Out of necessity, we've actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardwarebecause hardware 3 at this point is several years old. So I don't -- I think we're quite far ahead ofany other company in the world in terms of AI inference efficiency, which is going to be a veryimportant metric in the future in many arenas.So see, the new Model 3 is now available globally, so we did an update in Model 3. While the carlooks similar, a lot of work has gone into the vehicle to make it better in every way. It issignificantly quieter, more refined, better equipped, has longer range and many other improvements,and I recommend taking it for a test drive. If you have not driven a Model 3 in a long time, youshould really try the new one, so steady improvements.And we're very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle. This is an earnings call, not aproduct announcement."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "So there'll not be many questions that try to ask us about new productscoming, but we reserve product announcements for product announcements, not earning calls. So --but we're very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound not just in its design of thevehicle itself but in the design of the manufacturing system. This is a revolutionary manufacturingsystem, significant -- far more advanced than any other automotive manufacturing system in theworld like by a significant margin.Several years ago, I said the -- perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in thefuture will be manufacturing technology. And you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle.The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin,Texas. And then we'll follow that up with other locations around the world, probably our -- thefactory we built in Mexico will be second, and then we'll be looking to identify a third locationperhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America.In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries and a strong free cashflow in spite of a very high interest rate environment. And we are focused on exciting new projectsthat will -- I think, ultimately, if we execute on all these things, and it is very hard to do all thesethings, not a sure thing, but I do see a path where Tesla could 1 day be the most valuable companyin the world. I do want to emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now aset of possible outcomes. And previously, I would not have thought it is a set of possible outcome.So -- and thank you again to all of our investors, our employees and our suppliers for a strong yearand looking forward to a great 2024 and years to come. Thank you."

        "paragraph": "Thank you, and our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOThanks, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone. As Elon mentioned, we had a record year in terms ofboth production and deliveries for our auto business as well as record deployments in our energybusiness. This was achieved despite 2023 being a challenging year in terms of higher interest ratesand higher inflation. Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period. Iwould also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout.In terms of our 2023 financials, we ended the year with over $96 billion of revenue and generated$4.4 billion of free cash flow to end the year with over $29 billion of cash and investments on hand.Our 2023 GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of onetime noncash benefit of $5.9billion from the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. This was due to ourrecent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have recentlygone through a similar change in their accounting.Accordingly, starting with Q1, our booked tax rate will now be more in line with other companies inthe S&P 500. In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despiteus being in the early phase of Cybertruck era. As a result, our auto gross margin improvedsequentially. That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are manymoving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control, like the change in tariffs orlocal incentives, to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approachingthe limits within our current platforms.On the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in 2023. We fullyappreciate the importance of customer education as we are still in the customer acquisition phase.Our data suggests that around 90% of our vehicle buyers in 2023 never owned a Tesla before. Weare being creative in figuring out ways to bring in new customers and educate them about thebenefits of owning a Tesla versus gas-powered vehicles, the key among them being total cost ofownership. This concept is mostly overlooked for just the upfront cost."

        "paragraph": "We will be rigorous inevaluating our campaigns, curating the content and optimizing spend accordingly to support theoverall demand.There are 2 additional things I would like to mention as it relates to the U.S. market. First, forcustomers who qualify for buyer credit, we now offer that as a point-of-sale benefit for Model Y ,which means an immediate reduction of $7,500 at the time of purchase to the end customer.Secondly, we continue to offer very attractive lease rates for Model 3 and Y using our partnerleasing program. Note that the sales under this program are recognized as upfront revenue andreported within automotive sales.Our Energy Storage business had another record year with deployments more than doubling andrevenues increasing by more than 50%. This business is poised to again surpass our auto business interms of growth rate in 2024. This has been in the works for quite some time with us laying thefoundation a few years back by building our Megafactory in metro. I would like to thank the wholeTesla energy team for their efforts to make this a reality.Our services and others business also started contributing meaningfully to our results, and our fleets-- as our fleets grows as we expect the fleet-based revenues from supercharging, used cars andservices to continue to increase. For 2024, our focus is to continue growing our output, continuingour cost reduction efforts and increasing investments in our future growth initiatives. Accordingly,we are currently expecting our capital expenditure for 2024 to be in excess of $10 million. Webelieve this would be critical in helping us lay the foundation for the next phase of growth.Once again, I would like to thank everybody at Tesla, our investors and our suppliers for being withus in this journey. We can open it up to questions, Martin.Operator"

        "paragraph": "Thank you, and let's go through investor questions. Question #1 is from Michael. Given that youmoved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the time lineimproved so that we might see the next-generation platform vehicles in 2025?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe -- I mean I won't certainly say things with -- that should be taken with a grain of salt since I'moften optimistic. But I don't want to blow your mind, but I'm often optimistic regarding time. Butour current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025, sometime in thesecond half. That's just what our current schedule says. There's a lot of new technology, like atremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here.The reason I want to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because wereally need the engineers to be living on the line. This is not sort of off-the-shelf, just works type ofthing. And it's just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live on the line if it's in Austin versuselsewhere. So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half of next year. Thatwill be a challenging production ramp. Like I can't emphasize, we'll be sleeping on the linepractically. In fact, not practically, we will be.But I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any othermanufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world. It's next level. So it's always difficultto predict what that S curve of manufacturing looks like. It always starts off real slow, and then itgrows exponentially. So -- and predicting that intermediate S curve is difficult but -- so I don'tknow. It's hard to say what the unit volume would be next year. We're not going to make anypredictions on that front, but it does seem quite likely that we will start production next year."

        "paragraph": "Thank you. The next question is from Michael again. What has been the barrier to ramping 4680cells into multimillion cells per week rate? And when do you expect to get there? Drew?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. First, I just want to allay any concerns regarding 4680 limiting the Cybertruck ramp becauseI've seen some people commenting about that. Today, 4680 production is ahead of the ramp withactually weeks of finished cell inventory. And the goal is to keep it that way not only for Cyber butfor our future vehicle programs. And as Elon said, it is an S curve here too. Like it's hard to predictthese things. But I'm just describing our goals.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIt's a hard problem. Like there are entire companies where all they do is make battery cells. That'slike all they do.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringIndeed. Indeed.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe do a lot of other things. And we've got a lot of breakthrough technologies that take time tofigure out what is -- it's not just that it's a 46-millimeter diameter by 80-millimeter fuel cell. That'sjust the dimensions. There's tremendous amount of new technology in the cell itself.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd manufacturing technology.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd just regarding what the team was able to do in Q4, Texas successfully swapped line 1 from theModel Y design of the cell to the Cybertruck design of the cell, which was the 10% cell energyincrease I've mentioned before. And as with any major new product introduction, the factory andengineering teams collaborated to ensure quality of the new design and the process changes as theirfirst priority. And now our focus returns to cost and production ramp in Q1.And in terms of what we're doing, we're currently running 1 production line, 1 assembly line, using2 assembly lines in addition for yield and rate improvement trials, and we have a fourth incommissioning, and 4 more will be installed starting in Q3 this year. So definitely, this is a big yearfor ramping 4680.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc."

        "paragraph": "Thank you. The next question is from Adam. Should retail shareholders be concerned that Elon hasstated that he is uncomfortable expanding AI and robotics at Tesla if he doesn't have 25% ofvoting?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I guess let me explain why -- what my concern is here, which is that I see a path to creating anartificial intelligence and robotics juggernaut of truly immense capability and power. And myconcern would be -- I don't want to control it, but if I have so little influence over the company atthat stage that I could sort of be voted out by some sort of random shareholder advisory firm --we've had a lot of challenges with institutional shareholder services, ISS, I call them ISIS, andGlass Lewis, which there's a lot of activists that basically infiltrate those organizations and havestrange ideas about what should be done.So I want to have enough to be -- like if we could do a dual-class stock, that would be ideal. I'm notlooking for additional economics. I just want to be an effective steward of very powerfultechnology.And the reason I just sort of roughly picked approximately 25% was that that's not so much that Ican control the company even if I go bonkers. And if I'm like mad, they can throw me out, but it'senough that I have a strong influence. That's what I'm aiming for, is a strong influence but notcontrol. There's some way to achieve that, that would be great."

        "paragraph": "Thank you. The next question is what is your expectation for automotive gross margin ex regulatorycredits for the full year?Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOLike I said in my opening remarks, we're focused on reducing the cost of our vehicles. This is veryextensive and involved exercise, where we -- whereby we look at not just the component cost downto -- but down to the packaging used to get the materials to the production floor. Each element ofthe cost is scrutinized to optimize further.A few pennies saved at the subcomponent level, whether through engineering redesign or frommany other things, which I mentioned, leads to cost reduction. This is a constant exercise, and wejust have to chase down every penny possible. We have a strong team, which is hyper focused onthis. However, this is a very difficult thing to predict precisely because there are a lot of...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe don't know. We don't have a crystal ball, so it's difficult for us to predict this with precision. Ifthe interest rates come down quickly, I think margins will be good. And if they don't come downquickly, they won't be that good. Yes.It's always important to remember that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthlypayment. It's not that people don't want -- we have tons of -- we have lots of people who want tobuy our car but simply cannot afford it. And that -- as that -- as interest rates drop and that monthlypayment drops, then they're able to afford it and they buy the car. It's pretty straightforward. Andthere are no tricks around -- to get around this."

If not, why not?Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOAs we have said in our prior guidance, there will be periods where we won't be growing at the samerate as before. We are between 2 major growth waves. The first one began with the globalexpansion of Model 3 and Y ., and we believe the next one will be initiated with the next-generationplatform. In 2024, our volume growth will be lower, as we have said, because we're trying to focusthe team on the launch of the next-generation vehicle."

And when can we expect each ofthese to produce their first products such as 4680 cell semi and the next-gen vehicles?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringWe have recently broken ground the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate semi andother projects. But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success withthe next-generation platform in Austin before we start construction. Therefore, we have started thelong lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the 3, Y ramp withShanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramped really quickly.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. It's important to emphasize that, I mean, Model 3 production was 3 years of hell,honestly before, some of the really worst years of my life, frankly. Still have mental scar tissue fromthat, from those 3 years as do many. But then -- and then Model Y was somewhat of a variant onModel 3, so a much easier situation.And then we're able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of -- in some cases,significantly improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin. And that'sthe right -- I think the sensible way to go about things, is kind of figure out the core technology ofthe manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world."

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorOptimus obviously is a very new product, an extremely revolutionary product and something that Ithink has the potential to far exceed the value of everything else at Tesla combined. And when youthink of an economy, economy is productivity per capita times capita. And what if there's no limitto capita? There's no limit to the economy. And the technologies that we -- the AI technologieswe've developed for the car translate quite well to a humanoid robot because the car is just a roboton 4 wheels.Tesla is arguably already the biggest robot maker in the world. It's just a 4-wheeled robot. SoOptimus is a robot with -- a humanoid robot with arms and legs, just by far the most sophisticatedhumanoid robot that's being developed anywhere in the world.I think we've got a good chance of shipping some number of Optimus units next year. This is abrand-new product, a lot of uncertainty as -- when you have -- when there's a lot of uncertainty inyour uncharted territory, it's obviously impossible to make a precise prediction.But we will be updating the public with progress on Optimus every few months. And you can seethat the -- it's advancing very quickly. I was just in the Optimus lab actually until late last night.Like midnight or something, I finally left the Optimus lab. The team is doing amazing work.That's obviously the case where we want to make sure that Optimus is safe, especially at scale andthat there's no -- it should be impossible for any centralized control to upload malware to ahumanoid robot. So we're going to want to fold in localized shutoff that cannot be updated from the-- from a central server. That's the case where we really have to -- extreme thought to safety. Butlike I said, I do think it has the potential to be the most valuable product of any kind ever by far.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringJust to comment on the barrier. I think the barrier, and we've talked about this, is like getting it toactually do something useful.

But at the same time, we do aware -- there's awareness issue as well. So in Q4, we ran aseries of digital campaigns, very targeted digital campaigns across different geos and differentchannel. The target of these tests is really just to drive awareness and ultimately measure the returnon investment on those digital channels.And the messaging we're driving is really focused on our product and also try to address some ofthe misconception of the EV , such as safety, affordability. And one particular awareness campaignwhere you run -- in Texas, we reached the audience about 10 million unique viewers and generallyclose to 0.5 million visits to our website. A large number of these viewers are first-time visitors toour site.The traffic through these digital channels actually behave very similar to those organic traffic cometo our website.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean there are some geographies where our market share is remarkably low, like Japan forexample. Now we obviously need to make sure that we have Superchargers in the right locationsand the service centers are there and the product works well in Japan, but Japan is the third largestcar market in the world, of any country.So -- and we should at least have a market share proportionate to, say, other non-Japanesecarmakers like Mercedes or BMW, which we do not currently have."

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOkay. Well, it's really tough to find the unmute button on Teams, guys. I'm sorry for being late. Soyes, my question would be on like the cost reduction. You've talked about it already a lot. And if Ilook at it over the last like 5, 6 quarters on average, the COGS per car has been coming down likemore than 2% sequentially on average. So that means you are like on a trajectory of COGS per cargoing down 10% a year. So that's probably like unheard of in the auto industry. I don't think any carmanufacturer ever achieved that.But that's very, very mundane and very -- it's a good performance, but it's a very normalperformance in a lot of other manufacturing industry like microelectronics or consumer electronics.And so I'd love to hear your thoughts about whether you consider yourself closer to the latter, tolike a microelectronics business, where you have this ability to actually always improve costs, youhave more control on how things are pulled together into your cars, and you see yourselfsustainably taking costs down with that kind of pace. Or do you think your ability to take down costis actually going to become more like in line with the rest in the industry over time?Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOYes. I think I've covered this in a pretty lengthy detail even in my opening remarks and in aprevious question, but to just further clarify, we are constantly looking for what we can do to reducecosts. Like I said, it's a game of pennies. We've talked about it before as well. And the team isconstantly going and checking where can we reduce the cost further. And do I believe that we willhave the same pace which you've seen over the past few years? Probably not because, remember,we were coming out with a period wherein commodity prices were rising. So then we did seebenefits coming from that.So those are more or less taken care of, but there is more, which we're still chasing."

        "paragraph": "And I wouldsay a big kudos goes to the team out here at Tesla, both the engineering team as well as the supplychain team because every time we give them a challenge, they go gangbusters to try and figure outwhatever they can to take out further cost.But yes, I would -- like I said, I would want to caution that do not project the previous costreduction at the same pace completely in the future because with our current platform, we aregetting to a place wherein there is -- there are limitations.Unidentified Company Representative -Yes, the increased scale also sort of helps us there. As we introduce new products, we have theopportunity to go renegotiate existing suppliers for better pricing. We're looking at every penny likeVaibhav and Elon mentioned. Just to give you an example, our inbound logistics cost has comedown by 22% year-over-year. And this is because of optimization on using returnable packaging asopposed to cardboard, which is even better for the environment; optimizing trucking routes,negotiating better pricing with shipping companies, with trucking companies, going with the fulltruckloads and just doing that sort of -- the bigger we become, the more we put far into these thingsand the more efficient we become as a result of it. So those work streams are going to continue.Unidentified Company Representative -We are also getting into the tiers of supply chain to see where there are opportunities. Getting to theTier 2s, Tier 3, Tier 4 levels and then negotiate those pricing as well to get more efficiency out ofthe system.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd then on the design side, we're not static, right, like especially in areas where the technology isstill improving rapidly. Power electronics is a great example. We continue to bring improvementsthere that are like fundamentals sort of driven from the device up that result in cost reductionsgeneration over generation. And they don't only go into the new vehicles. They come to the oldvehicles as well. So that's closer to what you were talking about with like the microelectronicsspace. Some of that exists in the vehicle.Unidentified Company Representative -And certainly, our car is more computer than car in many ways and has a lot of new tech over thelast 100 years of automotive production, so everyone is trying to scrape pennies from.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc."

I don't know, it's some nutty number.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringI mean like if I just look at the main microcontroller that makes the motor go, for example, likewhen we -- when I think about what that costs when we stuck it in a roadster in 2006, the cost now,there's like no comparison. So we've definitely been riding that electronics cost wave.Unidentified Company Representative -And then even on like non -- what you call traditional vehicle side, we do things that no otherautomakers do to bring costs down through breaking down the way structures are built and the waywe put our cars together. And I think that mindset that we have is very much closer to themicroprocessor or power electronics industry than the automotive industry."

It's -- you mentioned this like phase in which you are between 2 big growthperiods. I'd love to hear you about what you consider the size of your addressable market with theportfolio you have today, like the 3, the Y , the X and the S. What's your estimate of youraddressable market? You're shipping like probably about like a 2 million unit run rate today. Andgiven the price points of these cars, what kind of market share of what you addressed with this cardo you think you've already achieved today?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI don't know if we have -- did anybody -- I actually don't think we have a firm idea that's -- it's hardto say exactly.Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOYes, this -- I wouldn't say there's -- I mean, one way to think about it is look at the automotiveindustry as well. EVs still contribute a very small market share. So yes, our goal is to try and take asmuch market share out of that pie. But do I have a specific number to give you? I don't think we cansay that with certainty.Unidentified Company Representative -And it's a growing pie as well. It's like it's 9% today, but it could be 20% in a couple of years or inthe future.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes.Unidentified Company Representative -And certainly, like the way we've looked at it, and we've always said this, it's not about how manyEVs you can sell. It's how many great cars you can sell, how many vehicles you can sell. And thatmarket's 100 million a year, and we're barely 2% of that. I still think there's 98% more to get.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI mean it's worth noting that if you look at, say, the average selling price of the other top-sellingvehicles in the world, they are much lower priced than Model Y . So like a Toyota RA V4, Corolla,Honda Civic, that kind of thing, they're much lower priced than ours. So people are really stretchingtheir wallets to be able to afford a Tesla."

The next question comes from Adam Jonas from MorganStanley.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDSo I can't wait to see the Optimus lab. I'm sure everybody on this call feels the same way. Your lastAI Day, Elon, was September 2022. Can we expect a Tesla AI Day this year? It seems like a lot haschanged in that realm and is this year the time?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, it's a good question. We have found that when we do these AI Days, some of our competitorsliterally look at what we do on a frame-by-frame basis.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDThey do.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorAnd then we find these things being copied.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSame thing with Battery Day.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSame thing with Battery Day. So we have to be a little cautious about revealing the exact recipe ofthe secret sauce. But I think some kind of update would be good to do. I'll talk it over with the team.And yes, I think we might do something later this year. Our main goal with these AI Days isrecruiting, so -- and to sort of change the perception of Tesla as people think of Tesla as a carcompany when they should be thinking of Tesla as an AI robotics company.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDMaybe as a follow-up, Elon, I'd love your thoughts on the topic of China-based OEMs expandinginto western markets as that -- as the China market kind of gets saturated and there's a tremendousgrowth in the supply, how much success should Tesla investors allow for this competition toachieve in western markets? And can you envision a scenario where Tesla could partner with aChinese OEM to help accelerate sustainable transport in markets like Europe and the United States?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, our observation is generally that the Chinese car companies are the most competitive carcompanies in the world. So I think they will have significant success outside of China, dependingon what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established."

And the next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.Dan Meir Levy - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior AnalystFirst, I'm wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock yournext-gen platform. You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a yearago, things in manufacturing and powertrain. Maybe you can just give us a sense of where theseinitiatives stand.And do you believe -- we know that there's a number of new features and technologies inCybertruck, things like 48-volt architecture really employing your 4680 batteries. To what extent doyou think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for next-gen platform and is really going to be agating factor to unlocking cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?Unidentified Company Representative -Yes. I don't think that anything in Cybertruck should be considered gating for the next-gen platform.We're obviously doing a lot of manufacturing innovations, as Elon said, for the next-generationvehicle. When you do something at that scale, you have to prove it out. You don't just throw it onthe line and just build it. So we're going through those validation phases for all those newmanufacturing technologies now.Sure, 48-volt was definitely something we wanted to carry forward, and it's something we hope theindustry adopts as well. We're also open to partnering if everyone wants to do that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & Director(inaudible) but people really know that this is like inside-baseball thing, but, man, 48 -- it's so hightime that the auto industry moved from 12 -- the random number of 12 to 48.Unidentified Company Representative -Random number of 48.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Well, it's much less random.Unidentified Company Representative -Slightly less random based on human injury but...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI mean dramatically reduces the amount of copper you need in the vehicle and moving to sort ofhigher bandwidth communications, sort of Ethernet level of communications as opposed to CANbus, which is pretty slow. So it's really just bringing cars to...Unidentified Company Representative -The 21st century.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, pretty much."

        "paragraph": "So certainly like -- it's like normal for a laptop.Unidentified Company Representative -Certainly bringing that like is an evolution in our architecture of the vehicles, but it's not gating byany means. The gating work is just to finish the design and manufacturing of the car, test them outand get them going.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, programs and execution, right? Right. So it's talking about like tooling lead time,manufacturing equipment lead time, factory lead time and executing this program.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThere's a lot of specialized machines that make the machine for our next-gen vehicle. So these arenot machines you can just order from anyone. They actually have to design a machine that hasnever existed to build a car in a way that has never existed.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. So you don't just have like a design validation phase, but you have an equipment designvalidation phase as well.Elon R.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, yes, exactly, manufacturing inception. So I do think it's quite a powerful, sustainable advantagebecause there just is no place to go to order the machines that make our next-gen car that don't exist.Dan Meir Levy - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior AnalystAs a follow-up, your release does not mention Dojo, so if you could just provide us an update onwhere Dojo stands and at what point do you expect Dojo to be a resource in improving FSD. Or doyou think that you now have sufficient supply of NVIDIA GPUs needed for the training of thesystem?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI mean the AI part of your question is -- that is a deep one. So we're obviously hedging our betshere with significant orders of NVIDIA GPUs. GPU is the wrong word. They really didn't see it --there's no -- you can't like produce graphics, so that's not a graphic processing unit, neural netprocessing unit or something like that."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "Yes, GPU's a funny word, like vestigial.So -- and a lot of our progress in self-driving is training limited. Something that's important withtraining, it's much like a human. The more effort you put into training, the less effort you need ininference. So just like a person, if you train in a subject, sort of class, 10,000 hours, the less mentaleffort it takes to do something. If you remember when you first started to drive how much of yourmental capacity it took to drive, it was -- you had to be focused completely on driving. And afteryou've been driving for many years, it only takes a little bit of your mind to drive, and you can thinkabout other things and still drive safely.So the more training you do, the more efficient it is at the inference level. So we do need a lot oftraining. And we're pursuing the dual path of NVIDIA and Dojo, but I would think of Dojo as along shot. It's a long shot worth taking because the payoff is potentially very high but it's notsomething that is a high probability. It's not like a sure thing at all. It's a high risk, high payoffprogram. Dojo is working, and it is doing training jobs, so -- and we are scaling it up. And we haveplans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2, Dojo 3 and whatnot. So I think it's got potential.I can't emphasize enough, high risk, high payoff. So I think it still makes sense given the -- even ifit's a low probability of success for the -- I think anyway -- I'm belaboring the subject. It's a veryinteresting program. It has the potential for something special. There's also our inference hardwarein the car, so we're now on what's called Hardware 4, but it's actually version 2 of the Tesla-designed AI inference chip.And we're about to complete design of -- the terminology is a bit confusing. About to completedesign of Hardware 5, which is actually version 3 of the Tesla-designed chip because the version 1was Mobileye. Version 2 was NVIDIA, and then version 3 was Tesla. So -- and we're makinggigantic improvements from 1 -- from Hardware 3 to 4 to 5.I mean there's a potentially interesting play where when cars are not in use in the future, that the in-car computer can do generalized AI tasks, can run a sort of GPT4 or 3 or something like that."

Langan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity AnalystAs we're thinking about going into 2024, the press release talks about hitting 36,000 or slightlyabove in Q4. And the comments on the release talk about approaching the [aperture] limits, and itsounds like you're continuing to try to [whittle] that away, but that sort of implies there's not muchleft.In addition, you have the hourly wage increase, I guess, will add to that into next year. And Ithought you said raw material costs are kind of -- that benefit is sort of almost played out. So isthere an opportunity to continue to go below the 36,000? Or should we kind of be modeling that itkind of stays at this level into '24?Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOWe are definitely aware of the cost increases, which are coming through because of the wageincreases. But like I said, we keep looking at other cost opportunities and try and figure out whereelse can we cut down. So there is definitely more opportunity to bring down costs further. I won'tspecifically guide to a number, which we will try and get to, but there's definitely more opportunitythere.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, we're chasing lots of cost opportunities on the design side still for 2024. North of 8 figures iswhat we're -- just in my organization. Lars has got a bunch. And then from a commoditiesperspective, it's such a long cycle time through the whole material supply chain that even with whatwe've already seen to this point, there's more to come on commodities reductions.Unidentified Company Representative -And there's still some tailwind left on the commodities.Andrew D.

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. And battery materials.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIt boggles my mind to think that if we make a 1% improvement in cost, that's $1 billion.

In the commentary, you mentioned the taxes would go to the S&P 500level. I think you've been trending slightly below 10%. S&P, I think it's typically 25%-ish. Is thatgoing to -- should we expect that to jump right up next year when we're modeling next year? Orwould it be like a gradual change over the next few years? And any cash impact from that taxchange as well that we should be considering?Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOYes. So there's no impact on cash taxes from the release of the valuation amount, which I spokeabout. What it does is it's how you account for taxes on your books. So it's basically an accountingchange wherein there are certain jurisdictions because we had enough NOLs, et cetera, wherein wedidn't have to accrue book taxes. Now that the valuation allowance has been released and we haverecognized deferred tax assets on the books, that means your tax rate immediately goes up."
