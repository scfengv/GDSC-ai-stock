        "paragraph4": "Our first question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.\nAlexander Eugene Potter\nPiper Jaffray Companies, Research Division\nThere's been a fair amount of debate recently, both amongst investors, I think, but also within the supply\nchain about the segments within the transportation ecosystem that will sort of forever be off-limits to Tesla\nbecause of physical limitations of electric drivetrain, specifically as it relates to weight and energy density\nand things of that nature. Presumably, you'd disagree, but I'd be interested in hearing maybe why you\ndisagree. Why you think Tesla can compete in those segments whereas other people think diesel or fuel\ncells or other options would be better?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nAre you thinking of things like heavy trucking?\nAlexander Eugene Potter\nPiper Jaffray Companies, Research Division\nFor instance, yes. That's -- I mean, I guess, different people draw the line in different areas, but as an\nexample, yes.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. I mean I'm not sure -- I'm absolutely confident that the electric car trains will -- electric vehicles\nwill occupy everything without exception. And I don't want to jump the gun on the Tesla semi-truck\nannouncement we're unveiling later this year, but it's -- I think it's going to be a cool product and will defy\npeople's expectations on what an electric truck can do. So I really do not see any segment of transport\nthat will not be electric. In fact, I'm highly confident that all transport will go fully electric, with the ironic\nexception of rockets, yes. [ If you know your ] way around Newton's third law.\nAlexander Eugene Potter\nPiper Jaffray Companies, Research Division\nRight. Okay. And then I guess maybe one Model 3 question here. I know it's maybe early days, is there in\na way to gauge sort of what you think the trim and option uptake is going to look like on the Model 3 just\nto give folks an idea on what the pricing and margin profile might look like.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI mean, it's really guesswork at this point. But if it were to be comparable to what we see with, say,\nModel S or with other vehicles in the market. It's something like a 20% to 30% increment over the\n[indiscernible] would be the typical average. Jon, do you have any...\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nYes, I think that's right. And that's -- we experience a little bit higher than that in Model S. And Model\nS in comparison to Model 3 has more range, has more power, has more cargo, et cetera. And we'll be\nintroducing at the start of production, I think we'll be announcing our vehicle -- as we get closer to the\nstart of production what these vehicle stacks will be, but I think 20% is a fair number to use.\nElon R. MuskTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, actually, just to reemphasize that, I might repeat this a few times on the call. We want to be super\nclear that Model 3 is not version 3 of our car. The Model 3 is essentially a smaller, more affordable\nversion of the Model S with fewer features. But the Model S and the Model 3 will be at the same level of\ntechnology. And if you were to -- if you were to put a version on, say, what -- I would say probably on\nversion 4 of Model S, and Model 3 will also be version 4. If you make it like the essentially a first -- when\nModel S first came out, it was rear-wheel drive. And then we had Dual Motor all-wheel drive, we had initial\nHardware 1 Autopilot and then Hardware 2 Autopilot, and there was a facial refresh. There have been\nroughly 4 versions of Model S, and we're on the fourth version. Model 3 will also be version 4. It's a little\nconfusing because one's a letter and the other's a number. And Model 3 was supposed to be called the\nModel E, but then Ford threatened to sue us. And then I thought we're being all clever by calling it the\nModel 3, but actually the joke's on me because it caused confusion in the marketplace. So we're doing\nour best to clear up that confusion so people do not think that Model 3 is somehow superior to Model S.\nActually, Model S will be better than Model 3 as it should be because it's a more expensive car. We're going\nto be -- sound like a broken record on this front, and the messaging might get a little annoying, but we\nreally have to be emphatic to clear up an error, which I think is my responsibility, in naming something\nthat inherently would cause confusion with marketing."

        "paragraph5": "Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nI was wondering if you could maybe give us an update qualitatively or quantitatively on how investors\nshould think about battery costs. I think your last public statement was that Tesla's battery cost early\nlast year was under $190 per kilowatt hour. If we look at how Powerwall 2, there's been significant\nimprovement in cost per kilowatt and in density. But I think if we try and do the math on Powerwall 2,\nwe'd still come up with a number that's reasonably high. So maybe can help us -- I think in the past, Elon,\nyou've said that you hope to get to $100 per kilowatt hour by 2020. And I recognize that's aspirational.\nBut maybe you can help us a little bit frame how we should think about battery cost today, what kind of\nimprovement you're seeing from -- or expect to see with 2170 batteries in vehicles going forward.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI mean, regarding numbers for cost [indiscernible] [ are close how competitive ] is the information\nexcept that we do expect to see significant improvements year-over-year as much as improving the core\nchemistry of the cell, reducing essentially the cell mass that is inactive and, of course, mass economies\nof scale and vertical integration at the Gigafactory. These will all take time to bear fruit, but there will be\nsignificant time. With the Powerwall, the -- there are a bunch of other costs in the Powerwall that are more\nthan just the battery cost. So you've got the -- you have the cell cost, and you have -- and you get the\ncell into a module, you've got all the cooling systems, the control systems, the safety stuff that prevents a\nrunaway, the enclosure, the modem to communicate to the Internet and then [indiscernible] would be the\npower electronics to take the power from the cells and eventually convert that to the AC or DC power of\nthe house keys. J.B., is there something you'd like to add to that?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nNo. That's a great description. It's a fully integrated product. It's a system, not just a bunch of cells. So\nwhen you -- if you're maybe trying to calculate dollar per kilowatt or the cost of the Powerwall, I think\nyou'd find it's extremely competitive against other home energy storage systems. We believe the best. But\nthere is a lot of other hardware in there that's all included, all wrapped together in the Powerwall price, so\nyou don't have to piecemeal the system in your house.\nElon R. MuskTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nRight. But we're quite confident that the Powerwall is the highest quality product and actually at the lowest\ncost of anything in the market. So that is a good product. And I feel good, feel pretty happy with it.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nAnd some of the improvement trajectory that you saw from Powerwall 1 to Powerwall 2, part of that is\nmade possible by the migration to 2170 cells made at Gigafactory, not all of it but a large part of it. So\nthat is something we're pleased with and feel it's going well.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nOkay. I was wondering also your customer deposits, and I recognize there's a lot in that, declined for\nthe second straight quarter. And at least by my math, it appears as though Tesla's new car inventory\nhas increased substantially over the last couple of quarters, maybe 3,500 units or about 50%, even\nthough sort of production and deliveries have been relatively constant. I'm wondering if you are seeing\nincremental demand pressure on Model X. And particularly Model S, Elon, you underscored that there\nwas confusion in the marketplace. And are these the metrics that are suggesting to you that there's some\nconfusion in the marketplace? Are you seeing cancellations? Because at least optically, it looks like the\nbook-to-bill is less than 1 on S and X.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. Deepak here, a couple of questions that you had. Firstly, just to clarify, [indiscernible] weekly\ninventory [indiscernible] very slightly from end of Q4 to end of Q1. And the -- and we are using some\nof that in different ways, and Jon can explain that further. And also to your other question on customer\ndeposits, what I'm seeing is that we had an artificial backlog in our customer deposits of Model Xs. And as\nour production of Model Xs has stabilized and as our mix of Model S has increased relative to X, we have\ncleared that. So it's nothing unusual from what I'm seeing there. And Jon, do you want to add on the...\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nThat's right. The increase in inventories is about split in 2. One is we increased Model X test drive vehicles\nby about 1,000 over the past quarter. We had prioritized deliveries as we ramped up Model X production\nand prioritized getting cars to customers first and to our store second. Our stores have finally gotten their\ntest drive fleets, and that's what you see in terms of the half of the unit volume increase. The second\nhalf is in our service loaners. So as our installed fleet has gone up, we need -- we wanted to make sure\nthat our owners were getting a service loaner, and we'll continually increase that, and you'll see that over\ntime. That's not a one-time event. You'll see as we continue to deliver this level of cars per quarter that\nwe will increase the service loaner fleet proportionally so that we've got the ability to offer a Tesla to our\ncustomers.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. And in fact, this'll take us a few months to fully deploy, but our policy for service loaners is that the\nservice loaner fleet will be the very best version of a Tesla that is available. So if you have a Model X\nthat comes in for service, the service loaner you will get will be the absolute fully loaded state-of-the-art\nP100D Ludicrous, best Model X that we have. The same for the Model S. So it will be the kind of thing\nwhere you hope that service takes a long time because you have the absolute top-of-the-line Tesla as a\nservice loaner.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nSo Elon, just to clarify, the confusion that you believe exists between potentially Model 3 and Model S,\nthat's not being inferred from order patterns? That's being inferred more qualitatively from what you're\nlearning in showrooms? Or how do you make that assessment of the problem?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nThere are no -- we have seen some impact of Model S orders as a function of people being confused\nthat Model 3 is the upgrade to Model S. Now we took action to correct that about a month ago, but that\nmessage has not filtered down to all of our customers. So there's still a lot of people who are under the\nimpression that Model 3 is the upgrade from Model S. But in fact, the one upgrade is just by the latest\nModel S. That's the actual upgrade. Not -- like saying -- thinking that the upgrade path from an Audi A6\nis an Audi A4. It's not. So yes, so it's just a question of correcting that misconception, which I'm confident\nwe'll be able to do in the next several weeks."

        "paragraph6": "Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nYou've talked about in the past reinventing the machine that makes the machine. And now that we're\ngetting a little bit closer to the Model 3 launch, any additional color on what steps in automation you're\ndoing for the Model 3? And any rough order of magnitude of how much more automated the Model 3\nwould be versus the traditional production line?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. So with Model 3, I think would be roughly comparable with the best high-volume vehicle production\nlines in the world, better in some respects, a little worse than others, but roughly comparable. And then\nwith some further iteration, I think it will probably be a little bit better than the next-best automotive\nproduction line. Then where things will really be a step change I think beyond any other automated\nactually will be the Model Y factory. And this is both a function of designing the product to be easy to\nmanufacture and easy to automate as well as designing the factory itself. So Model Y is where I think it\nreally becomes a step change, but Model 3 is going to be at or probably slightly better than I think the\nnext best automotive [indiscernible], that's pretty [indiscernible]. And then Model Y will be -- there'll be\nnothing close to it, I think.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nMaybe just to add as a relative benchmark, against the S and the X, the Model 3 is vastly more\nautomated. And perhaps it's not the best benchmark for you looking forward, it's perhaps 3 to 4x more\nautomated than an S or an X, and much more simpler to build.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIs that 1/5 of the hours per car?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nSo. It's 5x the volume, but the same hours per car.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nGot it. And as a follow-up, any color on -- you've announce the doubling of the Supercharger network and\nincreasing your dealers. I mean, how should we think about that over the next few years? Is that doubling\ngoing to be enough? Or how do you see the network needing to expand going forward?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, it's exciting that Supercharger network substantially hit that number just recently, and you can see\nthe growth plan on our website. That's going to continue to increase dramatically. Jon, do you want to\nspeak to service?\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nYes. Service locations are what you see increasing in the shareholder letter. But you should probably\nthink about service capacity in 2 ways now. One of the things we've discovered as we've deployed more\nadvanced service techniques into our centers is that a super majority of the cars that we repair don't\nrequire a lift. That frees us from brick-and-mortar service. And we've added substantially now to our\nmobile service capability starting first experimenting in the Bay Area and in some of our major markets,\nand we'll be rolling that out throughout the year. And so we're creating service capacity in 2 ways --\nmobile service and fixed service operations. But fixed service operations are becoming much, much more\nefficient.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nMuch higher throughput.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nAbsolutely, much higher throughput per worker, more throughput per square foot across really every\nmetric."

        "paragraph7": "Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nElon, first question's is on CFIUS and Tencent. So after acquiring this 5% passive stake in the company,\nI'm thinking given the highly sensitive nature of your proprietary tech and computer vision, AI, robotics, et\ncetera, and all the related infrastructure, I would imagine that the Commission for Foreign Investment in\nthe United States and the Pentagon might be concerned at the idea of a Chinese or a potentially Chinese\nstate-backed company going any further than a small passive stake. Am I watching too many Cold War\nmovies here? Or is there potential for some sensitivity on the grounds of national security?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, I think 5% is not that big of a deal. I mean they're not present at board meetings. They don't have\nany insight into Tesla that's not public.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nYes. As Elon said, this is a passive investment. And it doesn't require CFIUS clearance from that point of\nview. Again, they don't have any access to confidential information or board materials, so it's just a belief\nand the support of what they think Tesla can achieve.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nOkay. And just as a follow-up, Apple has enough net cash, I think, to buy Tesla like more than 3x over.\nIs there anything that Apple does or has, besides having more money than they know what to do with,\nthat could be helpful in Tesla's mission to accelerate the transition to shared autonomy in sustainable\ntransport? Could they be the type of firm you could partner with? And could you -- is this something you\ncould talk to Tim about?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. I don't think they want to have that conversation. I don't believe -- there's not been any indication\nthat they do. But obviously, Apple's company makes some great product. And yes, I mean, I use their\nphone and their laptop, it's cool.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nI mean, do you think of them more a competitor than potential partner? Is that unfair?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI mean, I don't know what they're going to do on the car front. Yes, it's not clear."

        "paragraph8": "Our next question comes from Tyler Frank with Robert Baird.\nTyler Charles Frank\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nCan you walk me through what your capital needs are for the Model 3 just to get to production and then\nto ramp production throughout this year and next year? And then how confident are you that you might\nbe able to hit that 100,000-unit production target for the Model 3 in this year? And then I have a follow-up\nafter that.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nI don't think we have indicated the -- we have just said in the letter, we'll achieve 5,000 per week at some\npoint this year and 10,000 at some point next year. So we haven't clarified on that. So...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. The trick with the -- when you've got a whole new product and a whole new factory is I don't predict\nexactly what the -- what that initial S-curve look -- initial push in the S-curve looks like, it's extremely\ndifficult. In every way, the production starts off slowly and then you gradually eliminate the constraints\nand eventually it starts taking off exponentially. But because of that sort of initial slow ramp that then\ngoes exponentially -- it's more changed in where that lands in the quarter, it can have quite a big impact\non total volume. It's a lot easier to predict where the upper flat portion of the S-curve is likely to be, but\npredicting the rapidly changing portion of the S-curve is just, I think, not within the ability of anyone to\npredict with accuracy.\nTyler Charles Frank\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nGot it. And then can you just run us through what the capital needs are sort of to hit that 10,000-unit per\nweek goal as well as where the battery factory stands in terms of its current capacity versus its expected\ntotal capacity and what time line is to get to that total capacity mark?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nWell, we feel pretty good overall about the capital needs and our ability to fund that to achieve that\n10,000 per week capacity and...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWith internal...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, with internal -- right, exactly, with our own resources and the cash that we generate from our\nbusiness as we ramp up Model 3 volumes. And overall, and J.B. can speak up more to that in terms of the\ncell capacity, that's all lined up to come in -- come online just ahead of our needs on the vehicle side as\nwell as on the energy storage side.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nAnd we initially forecast about 35 gigawatt hours of cell capacity and 50 gigawatt hours of pack capacity,\nand we anticipate to surpass that cell capacity in 2018. So that's going well. And with the increasing\nimprovements in the production density and speed at the Gigafactory, we actually ultimately believe, and\nI think we've said this before, that we can fit substantially more capacity than the 35 gigawatt hours at\nGigafactory 1. So...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. And we've said publicly that we think cell capacity at Gigafactory 1 is likely to exceed 100 gigawatt\nhours over time.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nSo the end stage of 35 is really sort of a passing point at this stage and will continue on from there.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, yes.\nTyler Charles Frank\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nRight. Okay. And then Elon, you had previously pulled out a target of 1 million cars per year by 2020. Do\nyou still think that's achievable? And what needs to take place in order to get there?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, I do. I think we need to come up with the Model Y sometime in 2020 or, aspirationally, late 2019.

Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nI wanted to first just ask about the order rate for the S and the X in the quarter and also get some color\naround your deliveries from a regional perspective. I believe there was an expiration of an electric vehicle\ntax credit in Hong Kong. I'm just wondering if that created any pull forward or incremental demand in\nthe quarter and if there's any air pocket to orders and deliveries for the second quarter, seeing that you\nmaintained your 47,000 to 50,000 1H delivery guidance.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. I mean, there was some pull forward demand in Hong Kong, that's 1 city on earth. So the\n[indiscernible] impact our ability to achieve our delivery target for Q2.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nAnd the order rate growth for the quarter?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, the -- I think we feel pretty good about achieving the sort of the 100k, roughly 100k, total for the\nyear for S and X, combined. That's where we kind of want to be. The manufacturing system at the supply\nchain is all sort of set up for that level. We continue to be surprised by how sort of, frankly, naive people\nare -- a lot of you are about production and supply chain. It's as though -- it sounds like an easy way to\nincrease production, it's truly not. You can't -- at any given production system, you design it for optimal\noutput and then you aim to improve efficiency, reliability, quality and so forth at that output. So the S and\nX system, as I said last year, was designed for 100,000 units. And initially to get to that rate, we have to\nuse a lot of overtime, a lot of expediting, and that affected our gross margin on the car. And now we're\nsort of at steady-state with the kind of the top part of that S-curve that we're targeting. And so now our\nfocus for S and X is improving production efficiency, continuing to improve quality and...\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nMaterial cost.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, material cost and so forth, to sort of -- and to get the right amount of gross margin for S and X to go\nto the 30% level that we've been aspiring to for a while.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nUnderstood, that's on the production side. My question was just on the what the order rates and demand\nwas looking like from what you're seeing on your customer base. Historically, you've given or provided a\nvery helpful color on what the year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter order growth rate has been on the S\nand the X, and I think it's a meaningful metric for what demand looks like for those vehicles and for your\nproducts. But that's okay, understood.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI don't think it's meaningful. We're going to produce 100,000 units approximately, so all that matters is\nthere's demand. Is there going to be demand for 100,000 units? I believe there will be. And there is.\nDeepak AhujaTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd there certainly sufficient demand for the guidance we've given for the first half.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nUnderstood. And just on the SolarCity side, it looked like a pretty good gross margin quarter. I wanted to\nunderstand how much of that was from the shift further into the cash loan versus the PPA lease? And how\nmuch was that? Or was it more associated with the ramping of the Gigafactory and production of the cells?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nIt was primarily seasonality. We had [indiscernible] production happen in the Northern Hemisphere in\nsome of the PPA leases and how we recognize revenue. And also it was we had some $14 million sale of\nenergy credits that helped us. And the credit sale is a sale that happen every quarter, but we have the full\nquarter of it, which we didn't have in our half quarter of SolarCity sales -- financials in our Tesla income\nstatement.\nLyndon R. Rive\nCo-Founder and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd plus, we've seen an increase in cash and earnings that improved the margin as well.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, that does help the margin as well, yes.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nI'm sorry to ask one more but that was a bit inaudible. Could you repeat that, Lyndon?\nLyndon R. Rive\nCo-Founder and Chief Executive Officer\nYes, we've actually seen an increase in the Tesla line business.\nElon R.

        "paragraph10": "Our next question comes from Martin Viecha with Redburn.\nMartin Viecha\nRedburn (Europe) Limited, Research Division\nThis is Martin from Redburn. I wanted to ask about the pep talk that you had a few days ago, where you\ntalked about level 5 maybe in the next 2 years. And I was wondering that it's probably going to change\nradically the design of the car inside and whether you foresee this in the next 2 years that the interior\ndesign would change quite dramatically.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI don't think the -- we're going to see a dramatic change in interior design. There may be an option where\nyou have club seating instead of everyone facing forward, but I wouldn't call that radical, just turning\nseats around. And I'm not sure how much people obviously would want to do that. I mean, the sensor\nhardware and compute power required for at least to have a 4 to a level 5 autonomy has been in every\nTesla producer since October of last year approximately. So it's a matter of upgrading the software and\nlooking to level 5. And if it does turn out that we need to upgrade the compute power, it's designed to be\neasy to upgrade, basically access through the glove box and plug in a more powerful computer. So we\ndon't think it will be but if it is, that's pretty easy to do. So the important thing to appreciate is that the\nsensor hardware and wiring harnesses necessary for autonomy which is essentially having the 8 cameras,\nthe radar and ultrasonics, that's in place. So that with each passing release, the car's autonomy level\nwill improve. We had a bit of a dip, obviously, because of the unexpectedly rapid transition away from\nMobileye, where we'd expected to have the Mobileye chip on the board as we transitioned but Mobileye\nrefused to allow that. So then we had to basically recreate all the Mobileye functionality in about 6 months\nwhich we did.\nMartin Viecha\nRedburn (Europe) Limited, Research Division\nOkay. And then the other follow-up question that I had was on the Model Y. You mentioned that the Model\n3 production line will be probably as fast or a bit faster than the fastest production line in the world, and\nModel Y will be the genuine step change. Does that mean that the Model Y will be made on a different\nplatform than the Model 3?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIt will be, yes, different platform. Just one example, but the wiring harness on Model S is about 3\nkilometers in length. The wiring harness on Model 3 is 1.5 kilometers in length. The wiring harness on\nModel Y will be 100 meters. And that's a redundant wiring harness. So really, wiring harness is basically a\nflex harness with a high bit rate bus, so you can put everything on a higher bit rate bus that doesn't -- a\nCAN bus where you -- your data rate isn't necessarily constrained. And we will also have make changes to\nthe vestigial voltage, so that not everything is 12 volts, which is a pretty absurd number, really, it's wrong\nfor everything."

A housekeeping one and then sort of kind of where are you kind of a\nquestion for Elon. On the housekeeping, your order delivery announcements at the end of the quarter, youTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nused to make delivery announcements -- you used to talk about deliveries to end customers. This quarter,\nit was just deliveries to customers. Is there any change in distribution channel, potentially using resellers\nin some markets that that's meant to communicate?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nNo. It is the same thing. It's consistent. We are delivering to individual customers.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nOkay. Second, a couple of years ago, when the stock was at $200, in an answer to one of my questions,\nElon, you outlined a scenario where you could get to $700 billion in market cap, that's about where Apple\nwas at the time. We're 2 years later, you're obviously close to the Model 3 launch. How are you looking at\nthat?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, now -- I mean I want to preface this by -- of course, I could be completely delusional but I think I\nsee a clear path to that outcome.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nOkay. And anything else in terms of other businesses or volume or still pretty much on that track?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nThe set of steps necessary to achieve that outcome seems pretty obvious and heavily involve Tesla getting\nincredibly good at the machine that builds the machine -- which involves, by the way, a tremendous\namount of software. This is -- it's not just a bunch of robots sort of sitting there, it's the programming of\nthe robots and how they interact. And it's far more complex than the software in the car. I mean, I think\nthis is just going to be a very difficult thing for other manufacturers to copy. I probably wouldn't know\nwhat to do if I were in that position.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nOkay. And just one quick question: Why pick-up trucks? Why semis before pick-up trucks?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, they're not going to be that widely separated in time. And part of it is we do want to show that\nelectric transport can do even the most heavy-duty things in the world. So it's -- I think it's pretty obvious\nthat we can do a pick-up truck. But it's not obvious to a lot of people that we can do a heavy-duty semi.\nAnd so just being able to kind of hit the corners of the box of capability. It's a helpful thing to do. Yes.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nMaybe I'll add a point. But a disproportionate amount of petroleum is actually burned by a small number\nof trucks just because of the high utilization, the high miles per vehicle, and it really lends itself, I think,\nwell to electrification.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nYes, exactly.

Just one is, since the Model 3 is maybe 2 or 3 months away, could you\njust give us a sense of what some of the most critical outstanding items are that are going to gate the\ncommercial launch timing? And now that there are actual physical test vehicles on the road, are there any\nsignificant changes happening?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, actually it seems to be -- we're not really seeing any significant change that needs to occur with\nModel 3. So it's coming in as expected, as the design continuation has predicted, it's getting pretty close\nto the bull's-eye, and I'm not aware of anything that would affect our prior statements about volume\ntarget.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nSo there's nothing outstanding vis-\u00e0-vis tooling, deliveries or things like that, that you're still viewing as a\ncritical item with some uncertainty?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nThere's plenty of things with uncertainty, but I don't know anything that would prevent us from starting\nfirstly in July, and exceeding 5,000 units per week by the end of the year. There may be some cost up\nthere, I just don't know of what that is today.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nGot it. Just switching gears to China. Obviously, domestic production is presumably very important to your\nsuccess in that region. China recently suggested that they may relax the rules for foreign ownership or\nthat they intend to relax the rules for foreign ownership. And I was wondering if you could just update us\non where you stand vis-\u00e0-vis the growth plans there? And are the rules for ownership, is that one of the\ngating factors?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI don't think this is quite the right timing to make any announcements on that front. But I would expect us\nto define our plans more clearly by the middle of year with respect to China production. I would -- I think\nit's good timing that -- I mean the China rule changes are good timing.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nGot it. And just lastly, unless there's a pretty huge Q2 for CapEx, it appears that you're tracking at less\nthan that $2 billion number that you had articulated of capital spending prelaunch of Model 3. Is that a\nfunction of savings, contractual timing or is that capacity issue? Just some thoughts on how we should be\nthinking about the capital spending relative to your prior targets.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nYes, it's not too far from it, Rod, and we are -- we have significant CapEx in Q2, and it's done in a big\nlump sum or a little big peak given how much equipment is being installed and then tested. Often, our\nCapEx payments happen -- and a big chunk of the funding payments happen after the equipment is\ninstalled, it's tested and then we have fairly good customer payment terms. In many cases, it's 90 days.\nAnd so it's just a matter of that process and timing and saying that we feel very comfortable in terms of\nhow that is happening, the spend and the installation, and we're all getting this for Model 3.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI mean, if anyone comes on a tour of the factory, it's really insane how much equipment is arriving and\ngetting installed and being brought online, it's really -- and I'm used to seeing a lot of intense equipment.\nIt blows my mind. Like, wow. And I think you'd also get kind of a visual sense for the improvement in\nmanufacturing technology between S and X and 3. So you just go, and look at it, it's like yup, that's\nobviously better."

And how confident are you in your ability to overcome those\nchallenges? And then the shareholder letter also mentions a run rate of I think 10,000 or approaching\n10,000 per week in 2018, which would maybe seem to indicate some kind of an annual run rate of\n500,000 or so Model 3s.

Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. The -- yes, all of that production is intended to be out of the Gigafactory 1 and Fremont. So yes,\nwe believe that can all be handled here. And far as specific constraints on Model 3, I just don't know of\nanything that really stands out. We've gone to great pains with the Model 3 to design it for manufacturing\nand to not have all sorts of bells and whistles and special features that, like, for example, like, with X.\nX became kind of like a technology bandwagon of every cool thing you can imagine all at once. It's like\neverything all at once. That was a terrible strategy. You really want to start off simple and add things over\ntime. But that was some hubris and real overconfident there. So with Model 3 it's the opposite. We've\ndesigned it to be easy to make. We've got I think a much better supply chain in place where we've got the\nA team from the A suppliers. We didn't have that for the Model X or the S. And as far as we know, there\nare no issues.

And then if I just may follow-up on the demand questions that were sort of asked earlier.\nWondering as you're getting more used vehicles back into the pipeline, is there any data to support that\nyou're using those vehicles to attract a potentially new customer to the brand? Or alternatively, is there\ndata that would suggest that perhaps could be cannibalizing some of the newer vehicles?

But the indication is that we're\nintroducing a new customer to Tesla at those lower price points.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, exactly. The demand actually increases really exponentially as price drops. The -- at one point when\nwe looked at it, I think we were looking at the right number, but the demand at the Model 3 price point\nappeared to be somewhere between 30x and 70x higher than at the Model S price point.

It's kind of a trade-off between how fast do we want to grow versus\n-- like, we can grow slower with no dilution, really. For sure, we could grow at a moderate pace with no\ndilution. We could grow at a fast pace with some dilution. Or we can grow at a very fast pace with a high\nlevel of dilution.\nJeffrey David Osborne\nCowen and Company, LLC, Research Division\n10x growth in 3 years sounds pretty fast me but maybe not to you.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, yes, but you have to look and say going from -- when we went from the Roadster to the Model S,\nwe went from making around 500 units a year to making 20,000 units a year. So that's a hell of a good\ngrowth, up by a factor of 40.\nJeffrey David Osborne\nCowen and Company, LLC, Research Division\nGot it. Maybe just out of the interest of time, the second question I had is just on -- it would be helpful\ngiven that there's hundreds of thousands of people that have put a deposit on the Model 3, can you just\nupdate us on what the cumulative U.S. vehicles sold that you have relative to 200,000 number to get that\n$7,500 tax credit? You mentioned elasticity of demand at certain price points, but certainly there's a large\ncontingent of people that put a deposit that unfortunately won't get the benefit.

And what the impact of demand is for those that don't.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI think most people are going to be able to get it that have put down a deposit. And it's just -- it's a\nphysical problem. Yes. It's sort of the credit rolls off. It just -- it's not like a complete close. It rolls off over\ntime. And we are prioritizing U.S. production, which also helps us with keeping things simple so there's\n-- we're not making many versions of the car for many different countries.

My guess is probably most people that have put down a deposit will\nbe able to get the full tax credit.\nJeffrey David Osborne\nCowen and Company, LLC, Research Division\nIs there a way you could just give us what the cumulative numbers so far in the U.S. quarter to date -- or\nsorry, inception to date?\nElon R.

But I mean, that's -- reservations continue to climb week after week.\nNo advertising, anti-selling, nothing to test drive, still grows every week.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd maybe we'll try clarifying that under the present regime, the income -- the tax credits on the car\ncontinue even after we hit the 200,000 limit, and they continue to sell in quarters but at a slightly lower\ndepleting scale. So it's going to be beneficial for customers even beyond the 200,000 mark.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, absolutely. And I should perhaps touch again on this whole notion of -- like, [ ODS ] has done all\nthese sort of entertaining articles, like Tesla survived because of, like, government subsidies and tax\ncredits, drives me crazy. Here's what those fools don't realize. If Tesla is not alone in the car industry that\n-- all those things would be material if we were the only car company in existence. We are not. There are\nmany car companies. What matters is whether we have a relative advantage in the market. And in fact,\nthe incentives give us a relative disadvantage. This is [indiscernible] in spite of the incentives, not because\nof them. And -- but these incentives have limited lifetime and they're limited scale -- like, for example,\nthe federal tax credit. And then the -- that caps out at the 200k. The carb credits, which the carb rules are\nwoefully weak. We can sell -- there are some quarters where we can't even sell carb credits. And when\nwe can, it's maybe $0.50 on the dollar, or something like that. Whereas the other car companies get to\nfully absorb the value of the carb credit. So, for example, gives GM roughly -- I count a $7,000 to $10,000\nadvantage over Tesla for the Chevy Volt. That's why like [indiscernible] well, GM appears to be losing\n$10,000 a car on the Volt. No, they're not. They're making it up in carb credits. But they get the full retail\nvalue of the carb credit whereas we get the wholesale value when we're lucky. But the carb credits only --\nare only effective at a production rate of about 20,000 to 30,000 vehicles a year. So that's why you'll see,\nmark my words, it's not going to be any higher than that for the Chevy Volt. That's the 25,000 -- on the\norder of 25,000 units a year or 1/10th of our initial production rate for the Model 3 or 1/20th of what the\nModel 3 will be next year. So Tesla's competitive advantage improves as the incentives go away. This is --\nit continues to be something that is not well understood. And for that they don't -- I'll also mention that --\nthe Nevada tax credits, which for the Gigafactory, it makes it sound like we got a $1.3 billion check from\nthe state of Nevada. We did not. Those tax credits are made up -- the vast majority of it is just sales and\nuse tax abatement on equipment in the Gigafactory. Taxes that otherwise wouldn't been there because\nthere was just a bunch of rocks there before. And you don't get a lot of taxes from rocks. So that's why\nit is essentially a no-lose proposition for the state. And in order for us to actually earn $1.3 billion in tax\ncredits for the Gigafactory we have to generate, over the course of 20 years, about $100 billion in output\nfrom the Gigafactory. So yes, it's worth about like 1%. And don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth\nand we appreciate it and that's nice. But this is obviously -- 1% is not the difference between success and\nfailure for the factory. And -- but a lot of articles write it in the past tense, \"Tesla received $1.3 billion.\"\nNo, we haven't. We did not receive that. It's only 1% of that, great, we'll take it. But I -- looking at the\nbank now, I just don't see it there. That's because it's just sales and use tax abatement over 20 years. But\nthe key takeaway is that as Tesla's competitive advantage improves with scale, it doesn't get worse."

        "paragraph19": "Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.\nJoseph Robert Spak\nRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nJust a quick one on service. By our math, if you look at the cumulative number of vehicles you've\ndelivered and the amount of stores and service stations, it's a little bit over -- or something around 700\nper I guess station. And I realize you're adding some more of these mobile units. But I just wanted to\nknow bigger picture how you think about coverage in the more steady state or at least at 0.5 million unit\nrate. Like, what is the right level of coverage needed for the larger fleet?\nJeffrey B. StraubelTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nChief Technology Officer\nI think, rather than thinking about store or service center locations, we think about it in terms of mobile\nunits and lifts. And so we are building larger service centers over time that have more lifts. So our initial\nservice centers, it might have had 2 or 3 lifts. And we're building now service centers with 40 to 60,\nsometimes 80 lifts. And so there's a density within the service centers. But the mobile capability expands\nthat quite greatly. So I think a lot of people do incorrect analysis to take cars in service divided by\nlocations, because the locations varies so widely. But that's essentially how we're thinking about capacity\nand planning capacity. And as Deepak mentioned earlier, our throughputs and efficiency are getting much\nbetter over time, and we'll continue to improve those. So it's our goal to stay ahead of the installed base\ncapacity so we're providing great service. But really the Model 3 has been designed for high reliability. And\nas Elon has said many times, the best service is no service at all.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nExactly. We're -- our aspiration would be we make 0 service revenue because the car never needs -- never\nbreaks.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nAbsolutely. And our service centers are sort of like the old Maytag Repairman. Yes."

        "paragraph20": "Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners.\nRobert George Cihra\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\nTwo quick questions I guess if I could. One just on energy, your megawatt hours declined sequentially,\nwhich just seemed surprising thinking demand is well above supply still at this stage. So when we could\nexpect any more meaningful ramp there? And then separately, on automotive, given that you seem to\nbe in the mood to talk about future unveils, which is great, any chance I could push that by asking about\nthe future urban transport bus? Not sure what you want to refer to it as. But the reason I ask is not -- is\nbecause that one seems a lot less about the product and more about just a completely different model for\ntransportation and requiring full autonomy and that sort of thing. I mean, is that the kind of thing you're\nthinking 3 years now or 10 years now or anything in between?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nSure. With respect to the battery stuff, it's a little lumpy right now because you're at a big installation in\nfourth quarter with Southern California Edison. And then we had a bit of a gap between the Powerwall 1 to\nPowerwall 2. So we should start to see that correcting in Q2 and Q3 and then particularly towards the end\nof this year, I would expect quite a dramatic ramp in storage deployment, like really dramatic.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes, and it's worth pointing out that we do still have a significant backlog in Powerwall demand and then\nwe're building capacity to address that and ramping it. We had a few challenges in parts of the supply\nchain as we've been ramping that throughout the quarter, the first quarter. But those are freeing up. And\nwe're seeing the production rates improve week-on-week. But it's a -- yes, it's not indicative of demand.\nIt's really our challenges of ramping the new products.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nYes. Like I say I feel really good about quite dramatic quarter-over-quarter increases. I think with -- well,\nfor every quarter I can imagine the future, it's going to be really dramatic increases in stationary storage\noutput. It will grow faster than the car volume, and the car volume is growing pretty fast.\nRobert George Cihra\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\nOkay, and the bus?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nOn the bus, yes. Having given a bit more thought to it, I don't know if the bus thing -- if that's actually\ngoing to be something that makes sense in the shared, fully autonomous environment. Because it may\n-- if you have a share -- if it costs like very little, like it costs less than a bus ticket to have -- make use\nof a shared autonomy fleet to go wherever you want to point to point. Well, why wouldn't you just use\nthat? So I don't know. I don't know if the bus thing -- it does helps with density to some degree. But then\nyou -- I mean you could basically have something like a higher density Model X or something like that,\nthat's got 10 or 12 seats in it. But would you want more than that? I don't know. And then when you\nfactor tunnels in -- big round tunnels anyway -- yes, then the density -- urban density in traffic, and it\ncan be fully alleviated with tunnels. Yes, it's more like the tunnel thing that we talked about that at TED\nand basically like the commentary afterwards was -- it was like the critics -- the most critical commentary\nwas there's a group that thinks that the whole sort of automated tunnel with electric [ scaping ] -- like,\nwell basically, like the tunnel thing, this group that says it's obvious, and there's a group that says it's\nimpossible. And I would like those 2 groups to meet. It's been like sort of like there's a group that's like\nthe flat earth society and the hollow globe society, I think they should meet too. Have a debate."
