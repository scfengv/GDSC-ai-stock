"summary_text": "Tesla Motors, Inc. Third Quarter 2016 FinancialResults Q&A Conference Call. The conference call is being webcast on Tesla's website at http://www.telsa.com/investor-relations/tlsa-financial-results-Q&A.html."
"summary_text": "The company's third quarter results are announced in the update letter at the same link as this webcast. Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Jason Wheeler and Jon McNeill will be on the call to answer questions. During the call, Tesla will make forward-looking statements."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: \"I'm very proud of the Tesla team for executing so well on Q3 and going into Q4 and beyond\" Jeff Evans: \"One of the things I've seen out there is that we achieved these numbers as a result of widespread discounting\" Elon: \"There's actually a chance that we will be ... profitable even including noncash\""
"summary_text": "The first question is from Colin Langan of UBS. The question is about the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Is that just this thing with the ramp in production? And what are the key drivers that are actually going to get you to profitability in Q4 without ZEV credits?"
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: The CARB credit mandate is incredibly weak and needs to be fixed. There are some quarters where we simply cannot even find a buyer for credit. The credit only applied to, what, roughly half of our market in the U.S., maybe slightly above half."
"summary_text": "A quarter ago, you were guiding to roughly 80,000 vehicles. A year and now 3 months later, we're down at 75,000. Can you just walk us through the factors that are impacting that lower shipment number, or delivery number, I should say. With nearly 40% increase in deliveries, can you guys break out the impact in gross margin to absorption?"
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We've not taken any action that would cause the Model 3 time line to be extended in any way. We're quite confident of reaching volume production in the second half of next year. We also are continuing to improve the capital efficiency per unit of the production lines."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We're very confident that a camera solution with 12 ultrasonics and a forward radar and the computing power that we now have on board is capable of taking us all the way to full autonomy. The blog that I wrote was very clear that radar is moving from a supplemental to also a primary sensor."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: R&D will continue to go up. But not like -- not in giant ways. Jason S. Wheeler: On the SG&A side, that's where we're really finding our operating leverage. Jonathan McNeill: CapEx was 25% year-over-year, and we bumped that up to 30% this quarter."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I think I expect SolarCity to be approximately cash neutral, all things considered next year. It doesdepend on how fast we ramp up production in Buffalo. I think we're quite pleasantly surprised by it what we debut on Friday. It's exceeded my expectations. And yes, I don't want to jump the gun on that."
"summary_text": "Jason Wheeler: We're still generally on track as we stated with the Gigafactory schedule and production. There's equipment being installed and being commissioned as we speak. So we feel good about where that's at, and we feel that we're definitely on schedule for production for Model 3."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We already see a significantimprovement in safety with the semiautonomous features. The more time that goes by, the more miles we accumulate, the stronger the argument gets about the confidence interval. So I'm really quite optimistic about where things are and where they're headed on that front."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: You will see a ramp up in Q2 -- in Q1 and Q2, as you would expect, as we get closer to production. And then a lot of the payments come after our start of productions in Q3, Q4. So you can expect it to ramp up a fair bit over time."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: Model 3 efficiency as a whole, that really is a quantum change in productivity, like really, really crazy. We think with Model 3, we'll be alien dreadnought Version 0.5approximately. Then it'll take us about another year or so, I don't know, summer 2018 to actually get toalien dreadnough version 1."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We've put out some very compelling loan products in the marketplace. We're always looking for ways where we can provide just compelling and useful financing programs for our consumers. And if we can use other folks' capital for that, great. If we use our capital for it, that's fine too."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I think it's a bit of both, really. It's not Teslaversus Uber; it's the people versus Uber. This would be a significant offset on the cost of ownership of a car and then a revenuegenerator for Tesla as well."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: Production ramp tends to look like a -- is exponential or ultimately, it's an S-curve. Exponential goes to linear, then goes to log. It's very difficult to predict exactly where that beginning part of the exponential and the S curve fits in between quarter to quarter."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We don't need to go out and raise much equity. The -- there could be unexpected things that occur. There could be some global macroeconomic slowdown. And so there may be value in derisking the business. We're not ready to make that decision yet."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We're really focused on Gigafactory 1 and Model 3, spending very little time on facilities outside of Fremont, California and Sparks, Nevada. So it's really hard to say at this point except to say it's pretty obvious that long term, you want to have your production close to your consumption."
"summary_text": "All right. Thanks a lot, Chanel, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And I'm showing no further questions on the phone lines at this time. Back to the page you came from. back to the site you were coming from. Back from the page."
