Alexander Eugene Potter Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division There's been a fair amount of debate recently, both amongst investors, I think, but also within the supply chain about the segments within the transportation ecosystem that will sort of forever be off-limits to Tesla because of physical limitations of electric drivetrain, specifically as it relates to weight and energy density and things of that nature. Presumably, you'd disagree, but I'd be interested in hearing maybe why you disagree. Why you think Tesla can compete in those segments whereas other people think diesel or fuel cells or other options would be better? Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Are you thinking of things like heavy trucking? Alexander Eugene Potter Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division For instance, yes. That's -- I mean, I guess, different people draw the line in different areas, but as an example, yes. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes.

[ If you know your ] way around Newton's third law. Alexander Eugene Potter Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Right. Okay. And then I guess maybe one Model 3 question here. I know it's maybe early days, is there in a way to gauge sort of what you think the trim and option uptake is going to look like on the Model 3 just to give folks an idea on what the pricing and margin profile might look like. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder I mean, it's really guesswork at this point. But if it were to be comparable to what we see with, say, Model S or with other vehicles in the market. It's something like a 20% to 30% increment over the [indiscernible] would be the typical average."

Elon R. MuskTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL MAY 03, 2017 CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes, actually, just to reemphasize that, I might repeat this a few times on the call. We want to be super clear that Model 3 is not version 3 of our car. The Model 3 is essentially a smaller, more affordable version of the Model S with fewer features. But the Model S and the Model 3 will be at the same level of technology. And if you were to -- if you were to put a version on, say, what -- I would say probably on version 4 of"

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division I was wondering if you could maybe give us an update qualitatively or quantitatively on how investors should think about battery costs. I think your last public statement was that Tesla's battery cost early last year was under $190 per kilowatt hour. If we look at how Powerwall 2, there's been significant improvement in cost per kilowatt and in density. But I think if we try and do the math on Powerwall 2, we'd still come up with a number that's reasonably high. So maybe can help us -- I think in the past, Elon, you've said that you hope to get to $100 per kilowatt hour by 2020. And I recognize that's aspirational. But maybe you can help us a little bit frame how we should think about battery cost today, what kind of improvement you're seeing from -- or expect to see with 2170 batteries in vehicles going forward.

These will all take time to bear fruit, but there will be significant time. With the Powerwall, the -- there are a bunch of other costs in the Powerwall that are more than just the battery cost. So you've got the -- you have the cell cost, and you have -- and you get the cell into a module, you've got all the cooling systems, the control systems, the safety stuff that prevents a runaway, the enclosure, the modem to communicate to the Internet and then [indiscernible] would be the power electronics to take the power from the cells and eventually convert that to the AC or DC power of the house keys. J.B., is there something you'd like to add to that? Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer No. That's a great description. It's a fully integrated product.

FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL MAY 03, 2017 CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Right. But we're quite confident that the Powerwall is the highest quality product and actually at the lowest cost of anything in the market. So that is a good product. And I feel good, feel pretty happy with it. Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer And some of the improvement trajectory that you saw from Powerwall 1 to Powerwall 2, part of that is made possible by the migration to 2170 cells made at Gigafactory, not all of it but a large part of it. So that is something we're pleased with and feel it's going well. A.M. Sacconaghi Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division Okay.

        "paragraph": "by my math, it appears as though Tesla's new car inventory has increased substantially over the last couple of quarters, maybe 3,500 units or about 50%, even though sort of production and deliveries have been relatively constant. I'm wondering if you are seeing incremental demand pressure on Model X. And particularly Model S, Elon, you underscored that there was confusion in the marketplace. And are these the metrics that are suggesting to you that there's some confusion in the marketplace? Are you seeing cancellations? Because at least optically, it looks like the book-to-bill is less than 1 on S and X. Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer Yes. Deepak here, a couple of questions that you had. Firstly, just to clarify, [indiscernible] weekly inventory [indiscernible] very slightly from end of Q4 to end of Q1. And the -- and we are using some of that in different ways, and Jon can explain that further. And also to your other question on customer deposits, what I'm seeing is that we had an artificial backlog in our customer deposits of Model Xs. And as our production of Model Xs has stabilized and as our mix of Model S has increased relative to X,"

        "paragraph": "we have cleared that. So it's nothing unusual from what I'm seeing there. And Jon, do you want to add on the... Jonathan McNeill President of Global Sales & Service That's right. The increase in inventories is about split in 2. One is we increased Model X test drive vehicles by about 1,000 over the past quarter. We had prioritized deliveries as we ramped up Model X production and prioritized getting cars to customers first and to our store second. Our stores have finally gotten their test drive fleets, and that's what you see in terms of the half of the unit volume increase. The second half is in our service loaners. So as our installed fleet has gone up, we need -- we wanted to make sure that our owners were getting a service loaner, and we'll continually increase that, and you'll see that over time. That's not a one-time event. You'll see as we continue to deliver this level of cars per quarter that we will increase the service loaner fleet proportionally so that we've got the ability to offer a Tesla to our customers. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes. And in fact,"

And now that we're getting a little bit closer to the Model 3 launch, any additional color on what steps in automation you're doing for the Model 3? And any rough order of magnitude of how much more automated the Model 3 would be versus the traditional production line? Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes. So with Model 3, I think would be roughly comparable with the best high-volume vehicle production lines in the world, better in some respects, a little worse than others, but roughly comparable. And then with some further iteration, I think it will probably be a little bit better than the next-best automotive production line. Then where things will really be a step change I think beyond any other automated actually will be the Model Y factory. And this is both a function of designing the product to be easy to manufacture and easy to automate as well as designing the factory itself. So Model Y is where I think it really becomes"

Straubel Chief Technology Officer Maybe just to add as a relative benchmark, against the S and the X, the Model 3 is vastly more automated. And perhaps it's not the best benchmark for you looking forward, it's perhaps 3 to 4x more automated than an S or an X, and much more simpler to build. Elon R.

And then how confident are you that you might be able to hit that 100,000-unit production target for the Model 3 in this year? And then I have a follow-up after that. Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer I don't think we have indicated the -- we have just said in the letter, we'll achieve 5,000 per week at some point this year and 10,000 at some point next year. So we haven't clarified on that. So... Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes. The trick with the -- when you've got a whole new product and a whole new factory is I don't predict exactly what the -- what that initial S-curve look -- initial push in the S-curve looks like, it's extremely difficult. In every way, the production starts off slowly and then you gradually eliminate the constraints and eventually it starts taking off exponentially."

Tyler Charles Frank Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL MAY 03, 2017 Got it. And then can you just run us through what the capital needs are sort of to hit that 10,000-unit per week goal as well as where the battery factory stands in terms of its current capacity versus its expected total capacity and what time line is to get to that total capacity mark?

It's as though -- it sounds like an easy way to increase production, it's truly not. You can't -- at any given production system, you design it for optimal output and then you aim to improve efficiency, reliability, quality and so forth at that output. So the S and X system, as I said last year, was designed for 100,000 units. And initially to get to that rate, we have to use a lot of overtime, a lot of expediting, and that affected our gross margin on the car. And now we're sort of at steady-state with the kind of the top part of that S-curve that we're targeting.

My question was just on the what the order rates and demand was looking like from what you're seeing on your customer base. Historically, you've given or provided a very helpful color on what the year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter order growth rate has been on the S and the X, and I think it's a meaningful metric for what demand looks like for those vehicles and for your products.

There may be an option where you have club seating instead of everyone facing forward, but I wouldn't call that radical, just turning seats around.

Wondering as you're getting more used vehicles back into the pipeline, is there any data to support that you're using those vehicles to attract a potentially new customer to the brand? Or alternatively, is there data that would suggest that perhaps could be cannibalizing some of the newer vehicles? But sorry to dwell on demand, but I just wanted to see if there was anything, given now we're a few years on, and you're getting a lot of vehicles back off-lease presumably, if there's any indication there one way or the other. Jonathan McNeill President of Global Sales & Service I think it's still early days, they're still at relatively low numbers. But the indication is that we're introducing a new customer to Tesla at those lower price points. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes, exactly. The demand actually increases really exponentially as price drops. The -- at one point when we looked at it, I think we were looking at the right number, but the demand at the Model 3 price"

As you were likely\nto be pursuing a lot of these adjacent opportunities, clearly a lot still there on the horizon. But now with\nsome more of these opportunities being a part of Tesla's business, does that change your view of staying\nactively in place with Tesla longer into the future?\nElon R.

Hopefully,\nstopping before I get too old -- or too crazy, I don't know.

One, Elon, at the TED Talks, and I think a couple tweets, you had talked about adding 3 Gigafactories, just following up to Tyler Frank's question on CapEx needs. Can you just talk about what your ultimate vision of Tesla over the next few years? Model Y factory, truck factories, truck service centers, 3 Gigafactories, China schedule, is all of that going to be funded with internal cash? Or do you see partnerships funding, despite the low margins that the battery industry has? I'm just trying to get a sense of what your ultimate vision will cost. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Right. Incremental dilution along the way. It's hard to say. I mean, I'm sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future. It's kind of a trade-off between how fast do we want to grow versus -- like, we can grow slower with no dilution, really. For sure, we could grow at a moderate pace with no dilution. We could"

Maybe just out of the interest of time, the second question I had is just on -- it would be helpful given that there's hundreds of thousands of people that have put a deposit on the Model 3, can you just update us on what the cumulative U.S. vehicles sold that you have relative to 200,000 number to get that $7,500 tax credit?

Here's what those fools don't realize. If Tesla is not alone in the car industry that -- all those things would be material if we were the only car company in existence. We are not. There are many car companies. What matters is whether we have a relative advantage in the market. And in fact, the incentives give us a relative disadvantage. This is [indiscernible] in spite of the incentives, not because of them. And -- but these incentives have limited lifetime and they're limited scale -- like, for example, the federal tax credit. And then the -- that caps out at the 200k. The carb credits, which the carb rules are woefully weak. We can sell -- there are some quarters where we can't even sell carb credits. And when we can, it's maybe $0.50 on the dollar, or something like that. Whereas the other car companies get to fully absorb the value of the carb credit. So, for example, gives GM roughly -- I count a $7,000 to $10,000"

They're making it up in carb credits. But they get the full retail value of the carb credit whereas we get the wholesale value when we're lucky. But the carb credits only -- are only effective at a production rate of about 20,000 to 30,000 vehicles a year. So that's why you'll see, mark my words, it's not going to be any higher than that for the Chevy Volt. That's the 25,000 -- on the order of 25,000 units a year or 1/10th of our initial production rate for the Model 3 or 1/20th of what the Model 3 will be next year. So Tesla's competitive advantage improves as the incentives go away. This is -- it continues to be something that is not well understood. And for that they don't -- I'll also mention that -- the Nevada tax credits, which for the Gigafactory, it makes it sound like we got a $1.3 billion check from the state of Nevada. We did not.

By our math, if you look at the cumulative number of vehicles you've\ndelivered and the amount of stores and service stations, it's a little bit over -- or something around 700\nper I guess station. And I realize you're adding some more of these mobile units. But I just wanted to\nknow bigger picture how you think about coverage in the more steady state or at least at 0.5 million unit\nrate. Like, what is the right level of coverage needed for the larger fleet?\nJeffrey B. StraubelTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nChief Technology Officer\nI think, rather than thinking about store or service center locations, we think about it in terms of mobile\nunits and lifts. And so we are building larger service centers over time that have more lifts. So our initial\nservice centers, it might have had 2 or 3 lifts. And we're building now service centers with 40 to 60,\nsometimes 80 lifts. And so there's a density within the service centers. But the mobile capability expands\nthat quite greatly. So I think a lot of people do incorrect analysis to take cars in service divided by\nlocations, because the locations varies so widely. But that's essentially how we're thinking about capacity\nand planning capacity. And as Deepak mentioned earlier, our throughputs and efficiency are getting much\nbetter over time, and we'll continue to improve those. So it's our goal to stay ahead of the installed base\ncapacity so we're providing great service. But really the Model 3 has been designed for high reliability.
