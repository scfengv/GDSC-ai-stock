"summary_text": "Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja, Robin Ren, Jerome Guillen, Andrej Karpathy, Stuart Bowers, Pete Bannon, and other members of the Tesla team are on the call. During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We're incredibly proud of the Tesla team for producing 7,000 Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles in the last week of June. We expect to, in the absence of a force majeure or some very unexpected events, be able to achieve an average of 5,000 model 3s or above per week for Q3."
"summary_text": "CNN.com will feature iReporter photos in a weekly Travel Snapshots gallery. Please submit your best shots of the U.S. for next week. Visit CNN.com/Travel next Friday for a new gallery of snapshots. Visit www.dailymail.co.uk/Travel each week for new snapshots."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: First of all, I'd like to apologize for being impolite on the prior call. There's a lot of hurry up and wait where some parts of the production line move well and one part doesn't. There are parts that we thought were right but then it turns out we've got -- they weren't right and then we send it back to the supplier. So as we address those slow parts, then gap -- grow gross margin, and so the profitability of the car just improves dramatically."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We booked a tremendous amount with Gigafactory 1. And we're confident that we can do the Gigaf factory in China for a lot less. J.B. Straubel: We found surprising number of ways to improve efficiency and speed anddensity as well."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We do not -- we'll not be raising any equity at any point, at least that's -- I have no expectation of doing so. For China, I think, we -- our default plan would be to use essentially a loan from \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0local banks in China and fund the Gigafactory in Shanghai with local debt essentially."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: Autopilot will be pretty easy to bully because they'll be optimizing so much foravoiding collision. He says he doesn't see autonomous cars as a potential germination or training grounds for things that would potentiallyhave a national security or military interest. Musk: I'd be pretty shocked if Amazon got into the car business, but I think BMW has great engineering."
"summary_text": "The ramp of the Model 3 will have a positive impact on Tesla's working capital. Payables increased by $430 million while receivable didn'tmove much in the second quarter. Elon Musk: Every additional car, every additional Model 3, you're going to bump up payables by something in the region of $20,000, and that's going to be the main driver getting you to breakeven and to stop burning cash."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We can do a coast-to-coast drive especially if we pick a specific route and then write code to really make that route work. The challenge right now for the team is just increasing the safety and utility of Autopilot to over a quarter million cars we have today."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I think still, by and large, what we will be aiming for is steel frame buildings. The tent itself might be a little bit of a distraction from actually the focus of what's happening inside. It's taught us a lot of lessons on how to be capital efficient in the general assembly area. And after this call, I'm headed up back out to the body shop."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I don't really know actually how others do it, to be totally frank. I just know that what we -- the way we're doing it and I'm told that this is how other do it and we are able to find ways to make it much better.Jeffrey B. Straubel: There's -- yes, there's -- we did this somewhat around the first time around."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We're highly confident of being cash.flow positive and GAAP profitable in Q3 and Q4. Deepak Ahuja: It doesn't matter exactly where we are in the month of July. What really matters is over the quarter because it depends on deliveries, depends on production."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We're aiming for a million in 2020, but somewhere between 0.5 million and 1 million seems pretty likely. Shanghai will be important for that, he said. Musk: \"We are hoping to identify a Gigafactory location in Europe before the end of this year\""
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We have such awesome ideas and probably the biggestlimiter on our growth is like how fast can we grow battery production and especially cell production on the wholesale supply chain. The -- probably my personal favorite for the next product is pickup truck and we're just doing an amazing pickup truck. And the Model Y compact SUV, probably the most popular car category in the world, obviously going to sell pretty well."
