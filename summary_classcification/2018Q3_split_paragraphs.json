So I'll make some opening remarks, and then we're going to talk about vehicle safety, Autopilot and factory safety. And we have a number of people from Tesla here to elaborate on that. So I think there's just a lot going on that you would find interesting. But I want to start by thanking all of our customers, employees and shareholders. This was an incredibly historic quarter for Tesla. Model 3 production stabilized. We delivered a total of 84,000 vehicles globally, which is more than 80% of vehicles that we delivered in all of 2017. In fact, we delivered more cars in this quarter than we did in all of 2016 in a single quarter. Model 3 became the best-selling car in the U.S. in terms of revenue and the third best-selling car in terms of volume. We saw higher revenues and significantly better profitability in our energy business. I mean, I think with solar, it may have been the best quarter ever for solar.

And I believe our aspiration is something that will be for all quarters going forward. I think we can actually be positive cash flow and profitable for all quarters going forward, leaving aside the quarters where we may need to do a significant repayment but -- for example, in Q1 next year. But I think even in Q1, I think we can be approximately flat in cash flow by end of quarter. This quarter was made possible by the incredible execution of our employees across the board, from sales, production, delivery, service, energy, engineering, finance and all of our G&A teams. Really every part of the business executed incredibly well. I want to thank everyone again for their incredibly hard work. I especially want to thank customers who helped -- it's like I've never even heard of this -- maybe this has happened before, but I've never heard of a case where a company's customers actually cared about the future of the company so much that they volunteered their time"

And Model 3 received a 5-star safety rating in every category and subcategory. I think that's the lowest probability of injury of any car that the U.S. government's ever tested. Looking ahead, we expect to produce and sell even more Model 3s in Q4 and expect that trend to continue into Q1. And we're excited to bring Model 3 to Europe and China early next year given that the market for midsized premium sedans in those regions is even larger than in North America.

I'm extremely very happy to mention I'm working with an extraordinary set of very passionate and very hard-working individuals, and that essentially shows in our product. So that's very important for us. And also important is our principal mission statement on safety because what we want to do is safety has been -- is probably the important factor for our vehicle. It's not just for electrical vehicle. Any vehicle, period. And that fundamentally differentiates us, so -- which essentially helps us to keep adding new features and new safety technology. And that's very important and that shows in Model 3. Just the things that we have.

Initially, it will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn signal before the car moves into an adjacent lane. Future versions will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement if they choose to. One area that I'm personally really excited to build on with this improvement is active safety. With the advancement in neural networks covering 360 degrees of view around our car, we can provide a level of constant vigilance that humans just can't.

We would need to at least bring lines down in Fremont for significant upgrades to get to 10k. But also just not -- we're not talking about massive amount of CapEx. But let's say like long term, it's -- again long term, it's -- predicting these on a quarter-by-quarter basis is very difficult because when you have an exponential growth rate like we do -- I mean, if look at Tesla's cumulative deliveries over time, it's like the cleanest exponential curve that I've ever seen. So -- but small movements in calendar time can look like a very large hit or miss one way or the other because it's such a steep curve. That's why I'm -- it's very tricky to predict things on a quarterly basis but a lot easier if you go out a year or so. Yes, I mean, it -- probably long term,"

Adam Michael Jonas Morgan Stanley, Research Division No problem. Yes, I do. Can you tell us about the folks who are taking deliveries of Model 3? What are the top cars, car models or brands that they're trading in or switching out of? How many are new to the brand? Anything you're prepared to share, and then I've got a follow-up. Elon R.

I haven't noticed anything worth highlighting other than it's just a lot of people upgrading their cars quite dramatically. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect This is a huge upgrade. Yes, for most people -- well, maybe for most, but for many people, it is the most expensive car they've ever bought. So they're clearly demonstrating with their money, that they're willing to spend extra money to get a Tesla. So like suddenly there's a sense of like mass-market premium.

Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Yes, that is our goal. We do not intend to raise equity or debt. At least that's our intention right now. That may change in the future.

As I dug into the inventory -- like basically finished product inventory from factory to the customer, I was quite surprised to see how long that took and that it was quite expensive in a lot of cases to get cars to customers. This was something I didn't fully appreciate before. And we really have a major initiative at Tesla to get the average time from a car exiting the factory to receiving the check from the customer, being in the customer's hands, we have to be clear, we can only get the check when we give the car to the customer. So getting the car from the factory to a customer, to get that to be as short as possible.

So every day, it requires $75,000 -- $75 million worth of capital. So every 10 days, it's $750 million. And we -- obviously, we have a loan from the bank that we can make use of. But the banks will only loan us 85% of the cost of the vehicle, which translates to about 70% of the price of the vehicle. So -- and then we've got this loan outstanding, which effectively increases the COGS of the car. And it dilutes the company to the tune of 30% of one of the inventory -- of the finished goods in transit is.

I think it was down 13% sequentially, and OpEx was only up 5% year-over-year despite revenue growing 71%. So on that front, I mean, in hindsight, did you get too bloated and needed to get more rightsized? And looking forward, how do we think about OpEx growth versus revenue growth on kind of a more normalized basis? Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer Yes. Tony, so excluding onetime items, our OpEx decreased sequentially by 5%, to just clarify that first of all. And a lot of that was driven by the actions we took in Q2 to be more efficient with our employee headcount. We benefited from that in Q3. And we were really careful in terms of all of our spending. The other piece that helped us is a lot of our Model 3 spending on expense, sort of, R&D is reducing because Model 3 is going into production. So Q2 to Q3, we saw a reduction there. And it"

So although that is not in -- officially in COGS, in my opinion, it probably should be, to take the ABL interest expense and apply that effectively to the cost of the car. Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer And from a broader sense, you're looking at it as the cost of doing business, which can be volume. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Yes. Just essentially, the cash flow for everybody increases quite dramatically. Dilution or leverage outside of the ABL line improves dramatically. And then the de facto cost of -- the effective cost of the car also reduces because you do not have the interest expense.
