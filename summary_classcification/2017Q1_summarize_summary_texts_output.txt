"summary_text": "The company's first quarter 2017 financial results will be released on Tuesday, April 25. The company will hold a Q&A call following the results. The conference call is being webcast live on the company's website at www.telsa.com. We would like to thank you for participating in the call."
"summary_text": "This conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the callover to your host, Mr. Jeff Evanson. Mr. Evanson, you may begin.Jeff Evanson: I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, DeepakAhuja, Jon McNeill and Lyndon Rive. And today on our webcast, we'll discuss our Q1 results that areannounced in the update letter at the same link as this webcast."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I'd like to welcome Deepak Ahuja back to Tesla as CFO. Overall, I'm very proud of Tesla for our first quarter. And I think second quarter's going to be great, too. Jeff Evanson: Sherry, let's have the first question, please."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I'm absolutely confident that the electric car trains will -- electric vehicles will occupy everything without exception. I don't want to jump the gun on the Tesla semi-truck unveiling later this year, but it's going to be a cool product and will defy expectations on what an electric truck can do."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We're quite confident that the Powerwall is the highest quality product and actually at the lowest cost of anything in the market. We believe the best. But there is a lot of other hardware in there that's all included, all wrapped together. It's a fully integrated product, not just a bunch of cells."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: Model 3 is going to be at or probably slightly better than I think the next-best automotive [indiscernible]. And then Model Y will be -- there'll be nothing close to it, I think. Jon, do you want to speak to service? Jonathan McNeill: Service locations are what you see increasing in the shareholder letter."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I think 5% is not that big of a deal. I mean they're not present at board meetings. They don't have any insight into Tesla that's not public. And it doesn't require CFIUS clearance from that point of view."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We feel pretty good overall about the capital needs and our ability to fund that to achieve that 10,000 per week capacity. J.B. Straubel: We think cell capacity at Gigafactory 1 is likely to exceed 100 gigawatt hours over time."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I think we feel pretty good about achieving the sort of the 100k, roughly 100,000, total for the year for S and X, combined. The manufacturing system at the supply chain is all sort of set up for that level. We continue to be surprised by how sort of, frankly, naive people are about production and supply chain."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We don't think the -- we're going to see a dramatic change in interior design. There may be an option where you have club seating instead of everyone facing forward, but I wouldn't call that radical. The Model Y production line will be probably as fast or a bit faster than the fastest production line in the world."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I think it's pretty obvious that we can do a pick-up truck. But it's not obvious to a lot of people that we could do a heavy-duty semi. The set of steps necessary to achieve that outcome seems pretty obvious and heavily involve Tesla getting incredibly good at the machine that builds the machine."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We're not really seeing any significant change that needs to occur with Model 3. So it's coming in as expected, as the design continuation has predicted, it's getting pretty close to the bull's-eye. There may be some cost up there, I just don't know of what that is today."
"summary_text": "The volume of cathode and anode that's been produced and shipped from the Gigafactory at this point is a lot. We're basically tracking slightly ahead of where we need to be on vehicles, but that's sort of as was planned. We don't want to be too far ahead or else we'd have a pretty massiveinventory issue showing up."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We've gone to great pains with the Model 3 to design it for manufacturing. We've got I think a much better supply chain in place where we've got the team from the A suppliers. We didn't have that for the Model X or the S."
"summary_text": "The company did kind of fade down your expectation for CapEx ahead of -- or in conjunction with a Model 3 launch from $2 billion to $2.5 billion. The spend this quarter was relatively low, at least relative to what the run rate implied. Is there any opportunity to potentially lower monthly lease payments to drive higher unit volume demand going forward?"
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We'll manufacture that ourselves. Most of that semi is actually made out of Model 3 parts, by the way. It's Model 3 -- it's actually using a bunch of Model3 motors. So effectively it allows us to have a very compelling product that has a low unit cost. The demand at the Model 3 price point.appeared to be somewhere between 30x and 70x higher than at. the Model S."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I intend to be actively involved with Tesla for the rest of my life. It's like -- I think my main -- so it's like the most valuable thing I can contribute is kind of product design and technology, but that's my forte. That's what I like doing. Hopefully, I'll be stopping before I get too old -- or too crazy."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: It's hard to say. I mean, I'm sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future. We are prioritizing U.S. production, which also helps us with keeping things simple so there's not many versions of the car for many countries."
"summary_text": "Jeffrey B. Straubel: Rather than thinking about store or service center locations, we think about it in terms of mobile units and lifts. And so we are building larger service centers over time that have more lifts. So it's our goal to stay ahead of the installed base so we're providing great service."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: With respect to the battery stuff, it's a little lumpy right now because you're at a big installation in Southern California Edison. So we should start to see that correcting in Q2 and Q3 and then particularly towards the end of this year, I would expect quite a dramatic ramp in storage deployment."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I don't know, maybe later this year. Probably not for the next 6 to 9 months. Jeff Evanson: Thank you, everyone for joining us today. Have a great day. Elon Musk: You too, Jeff. Thank you."
