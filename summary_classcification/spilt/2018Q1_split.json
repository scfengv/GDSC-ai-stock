        "paragraph": "Before jumping into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nI think our letter says most of it, but I think we're going to spend extra time on Q&A, try to answer as\nmany questions as possible. I think we should really answer -- so we're going to go as long as there are\ngood questions to answer.\nThe thing I'm most excited about is the rapid increase in output. We got -- just in the last 24 hours at\nGigafactory managed to achieve a sustained rate of over 3,000 packs per day -- sorry, per week, and\nactually reached the peak hour with -- if extrapolated outward would be a rate of around 5,000 cars per\nweek. And obviously, you can't take a peak hour and assume every peak is -- every hour is as good as\nthe peak. But it's -- if you can -- if you're going to achieve it even once in an hour, then with continued\nrefinement of the system and improved operational uptime of the machinery, it means that you can\nachieve that sustained rate with more refinement. So if we spend essentially a month or 2 improving the\noperational uptime and the system as a whole, we'll be able to do well over 5,000, I think.\nI mean, what's interesting is that, at least in the case of pack production, we were able to do this with\nminimal CapEx. And I think, in general, our understanding of production is improving dramatically --\nexponentially, in fact, and we are seeing ways to achieve improved volume with dramatically less CapEx\nby simplifying the production line, by really engaging with our associates, no matter how junior, and\nimproving the way that parts are made. It's amazing how everybody's got good ideas. Just need to\nsolicit those ideas and implement them and then making ongoing design improvements so that when we\ndiscover that something is not well designed for manufacturing, that we will very quickly change that part\ndesign and introduce that into the flow.\nOne of the things we also found is that there are some things that are very well suited to manual\noperation and some things that are very well suited to automated operation, and the 2 should not be\nconfused. So I should be clear that the vast majority of the Tesla production system is automated.\nHowever, as I mentioned in a tweet a few months ago, we did go too far in the automation front and\nautomated some pretty silly things. One example would be we have this -- so this is sort of ironically\nfoolish. We had these fiberglass mats on the top of the battery pack, but basically like -- they're basically\nfluff. So we tried to automate the placement and bonding of fluff to the top of the battery pack, which\nis ridiculous. Like so we had fluffer bot, which was really an incredibly difficult machine to make work.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2018 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 02, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5Machines are not good at picking up pieces of fluff, okay. Human hands are way better at doing that. And\nso we had a super complicated machine using a vision system to try to put a piece of fluff on the battery\npack. That same -- and one of the questions asked was, \"Do we actually need that?\" So we tested a car\nwith and without and found that there was no change in the noise volume in the cabin, so we actually had\na part that was unnecessary that was -- of course, the line kept breaking down because fluffer bot would\nfrequently just fail to pick up the fluff or put it in like a random location. So that was one of the silliest\nthings I found.\nWe were also -- and this still remains to be fixed, but -- in a lot of cases, but we're overgeneralizing the\ndesign. So for example, the current battery pack has a port for the front-drive units, which we then put\na blanking plate, a sealed blanking plate on. So essentially, we punched a hole in it and put a blanking\nplate at the hole and do that for all rear-drive unit cars, which is kind of crazy. We've added cost. We've\nadded a manufacturing step, better failure mode, and for something that is unnecessary. So that is\nsomething that's -- or example of some things. That's changed. So -- and then result is we've had a\nradical improvement in production -- battery pack production went from taking 7 hours to make a pack 3\nweeks ago to under [ 70 ] minutes now, so just to show that it's like really radical improvement. It's R&D\npossible.\nWe also saw a modest improvement in Zone 4 of module production. This, I should point out, is a clearly\nautomated zone, and we're able to also achieve a sustained rate of 3,000 vehicles a week. So we're\nactually slightly ahead in battery module and pack production than expected. And with some work at\nthe Fremont vehicle plant, primarily in the general assemble -- general assembly area, I'm confident we\nwill very soon exceed the 3,000 mark in Fremont. "

        "paragraph": "So we're already there in the body shop, which is also\nalmost entirely automated, where we weld up the body. They were already capable of over 3,000 cars a\nweek, and the general assembly, with some improvements, which will include reductions on -- reduction\n-- I should say, temporary reduction in automation in a few places, then we should be able to do 3,000.\nSo basically I'm feeling really good about the Tesla production of Model 3, and I'm very proud of the work\nthat the team has done. It's been an amazing amount of hard work and sacrifice by some very talented\npeople to achieve this outcome.\nIt's worth noting the -- you see a chart in the Model 3 market share versus competitors in midsized\npremium sedans. We are almost the best-selling sedan in the United States in this category and -- as of\nApril, and we will certainly be there in May, unless something really odd -- I mean, be there in May, and\nthen we'll really be there later this year, right. In the third quarter, it will -- I think there's a good chance\nModel 3 gets maybe close to majority market share of midsized premium sedans, 40 -- 30%, 40%, seems\nlikely, and maybe a majority market share later this year. This is coming from a standing start against a\nlot of established brands who have far more sales outlets than we do, so this is very encouraging.\nOkay. And yes, as this letter says, I'm feeling quite confident about achieving GAAP net income and\npositive cash flow in Q3. This is not, I'd say, a certainty, but it does appear quite likely in my view. We are\ngoing to conduct sort of a reorganization restructuring of the company in the next -- this month and make\nsure we're well set up to achieve that goal. And in particular, the number of sort of third-party contracting\ncompanies that we're using has really gotten out of control, so we're going to scrub the barnacles on that\nfront. It's pretty crazy. You've got barnacles on barnacles. So there's going to be a lot of barnacle removal.\nAll right. Any concern or make any comments?\nMartin Viecha\nThank you, Elon. Sherri, let's go to the first question.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2018 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 02, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

        "paragraph": "Our first question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\nYes. Want to talk a little bit about some of the -- first of all, if we talk about the -- sort of all relate to the\nproduction ramp. If we talk about the 5,000 per week run rate, is that assuming 7/24 ? Or at what point\ndo you think you'd get to sort of 5-day, 2-shift operation?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWell, first of all, I think a 5-day, 2-shift operation is a ridiculous way to operate because that would\nbe a very poor use of CapEx. Nor is it the way that we have operated in -- for most of Tesla. So the\nmodule production -- the cell module and battery pack production and powertrain production have always\noperated on a 24/7 basis. And the exception has been general assembly, which has operated on typically 2\nto 3 shifts, so about a 5- to 6-day, 20-hour shift; and paint, which has operated on kind of a 6-day basis.\nSo I think it just makes sense to operate the whole company on the same basis, but a majority of Tesla\nis always operated -- a majority of Tesla production has operated around 24/7 basis since we started\nproduction.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. And this is J.B. I can chime in. As Elon said, it really makes great use of the CapEx and the lines, and\nthat's why we did it, starting way back at the beginning of S. But aligning everything to the same shift\nschedule makes it so much more efficient because we don't have the seesaw of inventory, the underlying\ninventory between the different shops.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nExactly. And one of the key things to improving the capital efficiency of the system is reducing work in\nprogress -- work in process. And if you don't have -- if the shifts are not aligned, then you have to build\nup inventory in kind of a storage warehouse and then -- yes. So it's pretty foolish to actually operate\non a 5-day, 2-shift in any way. But it's -- this is sort of a -- we're using the chip fab approach to capital\nefficiency, so it's called [indiscernible]. I don't know where it says what. I'm not sure what it's called. But\nlike this is something called...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nUltimate workweek.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nUltimate work whatever, ultimate workweek. Yes. I think [indiscernible] people work like 3 long days and\nthen 4 long days ultimately, something like that.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\n[indiscernible] crews on and just using overtime on weekends.\nElon R. MuskTESLA, INC. FQ1 2018 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 02, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, yes. Exactly.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\nRight. So it seems like...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nIt's not like one person working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There are like 4 or 5 shifts.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\nYes. So if I just do the math, that would seem like 5,000 to get you to takt time of 2 minutes. And I go\nback to some of the prior conversations, I mean, that's -- my understanding is best in class is sort of 50\nseconds to a minute. And I thought the whole going faster than grandma walker was actually targeted at\nblowing past that, but sounds like you're sort of 2x the takt time of other factories.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nThe takt -- the number you're referring to is actually general -- the general assembly number.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\nVehicles per minute, yes.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, yes. It's general assembly number, not that other stuff, but...\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYou may have also not taken into account so-called OEE or the actual uptime of the line, which tends to\nmake the takt time a little faster than the product cycles.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nLet's say it could take us a minute then, because that would mean it's like over a 7-day, 24-hour\nworkweek. Like we could also just say -- actually we did our peak pack production today was 32 packs in\nan hour, so we're under a minute -- under 2 minutes a pack and rising from there.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. And probably the numbers go up rapidly as we go to the subassemblies that are in higher unit\nquantity per car.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ1 2018 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 02, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8So 4x per module, and then we have smaller subassemblies still that are factors of 10 or 20, even higher\nthan that.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. That said, I do believe that the path to manufacturing efficiency is velocity and density, and that\nis absolutely what we'll be working on rather than just trying to spend billions of dollars on duplicating\na factory. If you make like -- if 2 companies are competing and one has to double its CapEx in order to\ndouble production and the other one can, with minor CapEx, can just speed up the line by double, it's a\ngame over.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays Bank PLC, Research Division\nGreat. But in the meantime, the lines -- then I think what you're saying, some starts, some stops to get to\nthe 5,000 per week?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. You can't -- like you can't have like 0 maintenance time and 0 -- like you have to do equipment\nupgrades. You have to do ongoing maintenance, so you can't just have it be operating at peak rates 24/7."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nJust wanted to follow along on that line of question. So to the extent that you're adding humans in\ncertain automated processes, can you just help us interpret the extent to which these changes affect the\neconomics on Model 3? And to the extent that you've done some competitive analysis, all of these efforts\nin the Tesla production system, how do you stack up competitively against other OEMs in terms of labor\nhours per vehicle or depreciation per vehicle?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWell, I'll just say something -- so a few things, then I have -- Deepak can elaborate. Let's see. So the\nthing that I've noticed is, if you have a really complicated machine like the fluff bot that I was talking\nabout earlier, in order to keep it operating, you have to have a ton of maintenance engineering. So you\nhave like basically pretty expensive maintenance engineers that have to maintain the thing and fix it, like,\nbasically 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. The cost of the maintenance engineer may not be incorporated\ndirectly into -- or fully incorporated directly into gross margin, but it's nonetheless a cost that far exceeds\nthe labor cost of simply placing the fluff on the battery pack, which, as I said, that was unnecessary. So I\nthink to actually -- I do not see this having a much of a long-term impact in our cost. I actually see it most\nlikely our cost will decrease, or we consider the cost to producing the vehicles will decrease by getting rid\nof production stations that are really poorly suited to robotics because of the very expensive cost of robot\ntechnicians.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nRod, we are very CapEx efficient, or let me just start from that point. And if we look at our depreciation\ncost on a per-unit basis at steady run rate of 5,000 or so cars per week, we are, in my mind, well below\na lot of our -- I mean, most of our competitors, well below $2,000 per unit depreciation cost. And then\noverall, clearly there is some impact, as we have indicated in the letter, from the additional labor we'veTESLA, INC. FQ1 2018 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 02, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9added, but it's temporary. And our expectation fully is a lot of this labor will come out once we stabilize\nproduction and then figure out smart ways of automating where it makes sense.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nOkay. And just secondly, your comments in your letter on the advances in batteries were interesting.\nCould you give us some insight into how we can translate that into cost per kilowatt hour or some metric\nin terms of the gains that you're making?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nThat's something -- I mean, every data point, Rod, that we look at internally suggests that we are best in\nclass, but we don't...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWe're the best, just not in class.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. We're the best. Sorry.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nBest in a class of one.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nI think directionally, Rod, it's helpful to understand the different commodities and the trends that we're\npursuing in the batteries. Being on a path to reduce cobalt usage, for instance, has been something\nwe've been working on for literally several years now. And this has been extremely helpful in the overall\ncost per kilowatt hour, especially with recent commodity price movements. So I think we can't really be\nquantitative, but that, directionally, is a pretty good trend.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. We think we can get the cobalt to almost nothing."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nElon, so you repeatedly said, I think, in recent weeks that you do not need to issue equity capital at Tesla.\nI think many investors on this call would say it's better to raise capital when you don't need to. So I guess\nfirst question is...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nI disagree.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionTESLA, INC.

You may not need to, but do you want to?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nNo. I specifically don't want to.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nPerfect. Okay. My follow-up, Elon, is your cars produce really a large amount of data, and SpaceX gets into\nthe satellite broadband business next year...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nNot next year, but it's probably 3 years.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nOkay, 3 years. Some argue that SpaceX could offer Tesla a resilient cybersecure pipe for this precious\nvehicle data and a potential competitive advantage. So Elon, isn't bandwidth an obvious domain for\ncollaboration between Tesla and SpaceX one day?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nI mean, it might be. There's lots of interesting things we could do. Cars got a lot of computing power, and\nit's connected to the cell networks and WiFi and everything, or it's certainly connected to a LEO Internet\nconstellation. I haven't really thought about it, but probably there is."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nElon, you've talked about the downtime on the Model 3. You're going to take 2 planned periods this\nquarter. One has already occurred. The other is going to occur later in the quarter. What specifically have\nyou addressed in Fremont so far? And what are you planning to address a little bit later? And are those the\nlone kind of remaining bottlenecks for you to get to the 5k within the Fremont plant?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWell, the Tesla production system at this point is vast, so -- and we literally have the 2 biggest factories\non Earth between the Gigafactory and Fremont. Giga is still slightly smaller than Fremont. I think --\nwell, maybe just -- yes, slightly smaller, but it will soon be bigger than Fremont. And Fremont is like the\nsecond-biggest building of any kind by footprint. So it's just like there's -- this is a vast -- the full answer\nto that question is a complex one. The -- I feel very confident about our ability to get to 5k very soon in\na sustained rate at Giga, getting to -- essentially getting to 5,000 battery packs and motors and power\ninverters and charges and that kind of thing [ installed ] down at Giga by the end of next month. And\nbattery production, no problem. General assembly is probably our biggest risk, and I'm really focusing on\n-- personally on that a lot in the next -- in the coming month. And then the -- our paint shop is maybe the\nsecond-biggest risk after general assembly, but these are all pretty -- these are all quite manageable. It's\nnot like huge brain surgery to get these things right. It's a lot of work. I like to say it's a lot of -- just a lot\nof time and hard work, but it's very doable. And yes -- so it's really quite straightforward. It's not like a\nfundamental impediment here.\nJohn Douglas FieldTESLA, INC.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11Senior Vice President of Engineering (Leave of Absence)\nAnd many cases, we've seen huge gains through software that's in the car, software that controls the\nautomation and connects to our central system. So in many cases, it's not even hardware upgrades that\ncreate substantial increases in velocity.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, exactly. Doug makes a good point here, and I think that is -- that the production -- a really great\nproduction system is primarily a software problem. And there's no one in the auto industry that is\nremotely as good as Tesla -- at software as Tesla. We're -- I mean, Tesla is way better at software than\nany other car company. So if it is -- what I'm saying is true, that the biggest challenge in the production\nsystem is software, we are in a good position.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Maybe taking my next question in a different direction. What is your time line for launching the\nModel Y? And have you begun to spend for this, or that only begins to start hitting the P&L from an R&D\nand a CapEx perspective in 2019?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nIt will only start to become significant in 2019.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nOkay. So all of the CapEx spend for this year is associated with Fremont, Model 3, Gigafactory?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nNo, no. I mean, please take me literally. I said it will only start to become significant next year. It's not 0\nright now, but it's not a big number. It's not a big number relative to our revenue.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nIn the early days of product development anyway, there's not much CapEx. CapEx becomes greater as you\ncommit it to equipment and equipment starts to come in-house.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. Although it is remarkable -- although the amount of money spent in the beginning is really quite low\nin the beginning of a development program, decisions made at the beginning of a development program\nhave massive implications for future CapEx. So it is better to spend a bit more time making the right\ndesign decisions and really thinking through the producibility of a product before racing ahead with CapEx\ndecisions. There's no question we could have made the Model 3 much easier to produce than we have.\nModel Y, I think Model Y is going to be a manufacturing revolution. It will be, I think, incredible from a\nmanufacturing standpoint because we do not want to go through this pain again, yes."

I just wanted to clarify the gross margin comments related to Model 3 that you put in the letter. You\nsaid a couple of things. You said, over the medium term, Model 3 gross margins would be below the target\nof 25%. You also said that in Q3 and Q4, that those gross margins would be highly positive. So I'm just\ntrying to understand what's possible for Model 3 gross margins by the end of the year. Could we get to a\nnumber that's close to 20%?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nWhat I'd say is that progressively, each quarter, we will be getting better.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nThe answer is yes, and it'll come down to what other economics come into play from currencies to\ncommodities, and how much more cost we take out from labor.

Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWell, Jim is a great guy. And the sort of dream he wanted to pursue for a long time to -- which is to\nkind of redesign how server architecture works, it's not something that I find a lot interesting, but it's\nsomething that Jim -- it's been a sort of a personal dream for Jim to do, and that's why he went to Intel.\nThe Tesla -- the actual design of the Tesla hardware is primarily led by Pete Bannon. I should be clear,\nlike the lead designer of that is Pete Bannon, who is still with Tesla, and then of course Andrej Karpathy is\nhead of our AI team.

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nI just wanted to follow up on the previous question and the gross margin targets. I think you had said last\nquarter that once you got to 5,000 units, you felt that you could get to 25% gross margins on Model 3, so\nthat feels like at least a 6- or 9-month delay relative to what you thought a quarter ago. And I'm trying to\nunderstand what the key drivers are. Is it really the labor for capital substitution? I don't think currency\nsequentially has changed much. I understand it can be a headwind. But I think relative to when you made\nthose statements, it hasn't changed. So perhaps you can help us understand what has changed in terms\nof the gross margin ramp for Model 3 relative to what you thought before. And I have a follow-up, please.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, it's along the lines of what we said in the letter. If we look at the combination of the recently imposed\ntariffs, Section 232 and countervailing duties plus commodity price increases as well as the weaker dollar,\nthat is adding significant material cost. And then temporarily, we are using more labor. So when you\ncombine those 2, that's what led to our guidance. And certainly, the material -- the labor cost piece, we\nwill address and that will come out.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes.

Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nSure. So I mean, that's -- thank you for an interesting question. The launch involve -- where things are\nobviously going towards is a shared electric autonomy model. So the -- in order for this to -- obviously\nfor the whole sort of system to work, you need all the pieces in place. You need to have full autonomy,\nfull 4 or 5, whatever you want to call it, and obviously a lot of cars in the road and then build the software\ninfrastructure behind that to enable shared autonomy, so to help enable people to share their cars and\nbe able to offer their cars as effectively kind of a robo Lyft or robo Uber. It's sort of like a combination of\nlike, I guess, Uber, Lyft and Airbnb type of thing, where you can own your car and have a higher percent\nusage of an autonomous electric car. You can say it's available generally to anyone who wants to use it\nwhen you're not using it. You can recall it at will. You can restrict usage to only friends and family or only\nusers who are 5-star. Like this is like the obvious thing that's going to happen. But in order for that to be\nin place, we have to obviously sell full autonomy, and we're making a really good progress on that front.\nI believe that the current production of -- the vehicles that we are currently producing are capable of full\nautonomy, but the only thing that would really be, like, might be needed or maybe is probably needed\nis a computer upgrade to have more processing power for the vision neural net. But that's a plug-in\nreplacement, a thing that can be done quite easily. So I think we're really well positioned and are building\nthe right -- the foundation for a -- having millions, ultimately tens of millions of shared autonomous\nelectric vehicles.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 15And specifically on the timing, though, do you have any details about or when we could even expect to\nlearn more about the timing of this service?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWell, the hardest thing to predict about the timing is regulatory approval. The thing that's tricky with\nautonomous vehicles is that autonomy doesn't reduce the accident rate or fatality rate to 0 . It improves\nit substantially. But the reality is that even though we think our -- when we think autonomy, even car\nautonomy reduces the probability of a death by 30%, which would be incredible because this is like, if\napplied broadly, there's over 1 million, I think, 1.2 million automotive deaths per year. And how many\ndo you read about? Basically none of them. However -- and but if it's an autonomous situation, you --\nit's headline news. And the media fails to mention that, actually, they shouldn't really be writing the\nstory. They should be writing a story about how autonomous cars are really safe, but that's not the story\nif you want a click on, so they write inflammatory headlines that are fundamentally misleading to the\nreaders. It's really outrageous. So -- and this would be true like even if electric cars were -- I'm sorry, if\nautonomous cars were 10x safer. So instead of 1 million deaths, you have 100,000 deaths, there's still\ngoing to be people who will still sue and say, \"Hey, you're responsible for the death here.\" And it's like,\nwell, the 90% of people who didn't die are not suing. They're not -- they're still alive. You just don't know\nit, so you -- we've got to deal with that. And then obviously regulators respond to public pressure and\nthe press. So if the press is hounding the regulators, and the public is laboring on misapprehension that\nautonomy is less safe because of that -- of misleading press, then this is where I find the things to -- the\nchallenge of predicting it to be very difficult. And yes, it's really incredibly irresponsible of any journalist\nwith integrity to write an article that would lead people to believe that Tesla -- that autonomy is less safe\nbecause people might actually turn it off and then die. So anyway, I'm really upset by those.\nGalileo Russell\nYes. Really interesting answer.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nI can personally say, from a technical standpoint, I think we'll probably be ready by the end of next year.\nGalileo Russell\nAwesome. And then one more quick thing on production capacity and speed of the Fremont line because\nthis is something you mentioned a lot, it seems. And in the last quarterly conference call, you mentioned\nthe max capacity with 700,000 cars for Fremont or somewhere around there. And that was S, X and 3.\nAnd so we recently got a report form Reuters saying that Model Y production would start in November\n2019 at Fremont. And so I'm just kind of curious, with the Semi and the Model Y launching next year, like\nwhere are you actually planning on assembling these vehicles?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nThe Reuters report is based on nothing, like I don't know where that came from. We will not be starting\nproduction on Model Y at the end of next year. I would say it's probably closer to 24 months from now. So\n2020 is more likely a prospect for Model Y, or early 2020. And the production location for Model Y has not\nbeen decided. We're really crowded here at Fremont. I don't know where we'd put the Model Y production.\nSo it's difficult to imagine that. We just could not fit the Model Y production at Fremont. We are jammed to\nthe gills here. So one thing I'm sure, it's not here. It is crazy packed, and we're -- yes. And so we'll try to\nfigure out what the optimal location is for Model Y production, but it's not here, not here in Fremont.\nGalileo Russell\nOkay. And I'm not an expert in battery pack technology, but it seems that a lot of people are speculating\nthat the specs for the Semi truck, even, I believe, the CEO of Daimler said it breaks the laws of physics.\nSo I'm wondering is this just a linear...TESLA, INC.

Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nHe doesn't know much about physics. I know him. I'm pretty happy you're engaged in a physics discussion\nwith him. I actually studied physics in college.\nGalileo Russell\nSo yes, my question is, is that just a linear improvement in your battery technology? Or is there some sort\nof new breakthrough or different platform that the Semi and Roadster are going to be built on?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nLike even if we didn't -- I mean, even if we didn't improve our battery technology at all, we could achieve\na 500-mile range truck. At all. We're going to do better than 500 miles.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. This is J.B. I think the key point is it doesn't require some dramatic breakthrough that -- so there's\na fundamental misunderstanding, I think, of what the current technology in our existing products can\nactually do. And maybe that's just a misunderstanding of the current status of the technology versus\nothers in the industry. That could be where some of that's coming from. If they're benchmarking sort of\nthe best battery pack they can buy from a supplier and then mapping that with what the Semi could do,\nit doesn't give you -- it doesn't solve. I think that's maybe where some of this is coming from. But we -- I\nmean, we basically have what we need in-house and understand how to do those specs today or better, as\nElon said.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWe could do a 500-mile range Semi today. I think the actual production unit will be about 600-mile range.\nGalileo Russell\nAwesome, great stuff. So I'm also wondering, are you guys going to let Porsche beat you to market with a\n350-kilowatt hour Supercharger? Because I know you've mentioned a V3...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWe'll keep going until you ask questions that are not boring.\nGalileo Russell\nYes, I can keep going. So the 350-kilowatt charger from Porsche, like if they had mentioned they're\nrolling that out, on the lab call, J.B., you seemed to indicate that you guys were sort of going to keep\nthe status quo with your Supercharger technology. But Elon, I know you've mentioned that there is a V3\nSupercharger, so I'm just trying to get some clarity on whether you will be improving your Supercharger\ntechnology or not and if there is a V3.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWell, we're definitely going to be improving our Supercharger technology. The thing about a 350-kilowatt\ncharger is it doesn't actually make a ton of sense unless you've got a monster battery pack or have like a\ncrazy high C-rate, in which case your energy density is going to be poor. So it's kind of cockamamie. Yes,\nI think maybe 200 -- on a -- also I don't know if you meant 350 kilowatts for a single car. That's really\npretty -- you're going to frag the battery pack if you do that. There's no -- you cannot charge a high-\nenergy battery pack at that rate unless it's a very high kilowatt-hour battery pack. So something along the\n-- yes, I think -- J.B., like a couple hundred -- 200, 250, maybe...TESLA, INC.

Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes, I mean, that -- that's definitely sort of power level that we've discussed and explored. And some of\nit also comes down to an optimization around utility versus cost and trade-offs in the car itself. You kind\nof hinted at that, Elon, but there is a trade-off fundamentally between charge speed and essentially range\nor cost of battery. And we look at that pretty carefully. We understand the trade-off, and we could design\ncells in the pack that could charge it faster than 300, 400 kilowatts. But it's not a very useful trade-off to\nthe customer. That's...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nLet's go to understand the difference between energy and power even, really. Energy -- obviously,\nenergy's rate is essentially, at most, a range. And then power is kind of like your peak acceleration\nbasically, the rate at which you consume energy. So really what -- it's more important to have long range\nthan it is to have a superfast charge time. And you can sort of think about this in the devices that you use.\nLike would you rather have a cell phone that lasted 2 hours but had -- it could charge in 5 minutes or 10\nminutes, let's say, but only lasted 2 hours. Or you'd like a cell phone that lasts 2 days and maybe takes 1\nhour to charge."

        "paragraph": "Our next...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. I -- we'll keep going until we have quick questions on -- are still -- while they're interesting.\nGalileo Russell\nI have a couple more. For the Superchargers, I know you guys are not trying to profit off of Tesla owners\nwith that infrastructure, but would you ever open that up to other automakers and try and generate\nrevenue from that system?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWe've always said that we're -- this is not intended to be a walled garden, and we're happy to support\nother automakers and let them use our Supercharger stations. They would just need to pay the share of\nthe cost proportionate to their vehicle usage. And they would need to be able to accept our charge rate\nor at least -- and our connector, at least have an adaptor to our connector. So this is something we're\nvery open to, but so far none of the other car makers have wanted to do this. But it's like not because of\nopposition from us. This is not a walled garden. Trying to make a meritable share.\nGalileo Russell\nOkay. And maybe could you clarify what's the strategy? Like it seems like that would be a very strong\nmoat to have this, that work that you guys have been building globally for years. So why open it up, and\nwhy is that not a moat?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nSorry. Can you repeat the question?\nGalileo Russell\nI'm just wondering why that isn't a moat because as a long-term investor, I feel like the charging\ninfrastructure you guys have built would take years and millions of dollars for another brand to replicate.\nSo I'm just curious about the strategic thinking behind opening that up versus keeping it closed.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2018 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 02, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 18Elon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nFirst of all, I think moats are lame. I mean, they're like nice and sort of quaint in a vestigial way. But like\nif your only defense against like invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. What matters is the pace\nof innovation. That is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness. And for any given company, if\nthe rate of innovation -- let's say, like our competitors, maybe they're -- they come out with something\nnear every 6 years. We're maybe every 2 to 3 years. So if our innovation is, let's say, twice that of any\ngiven competitor, then it is simply -- this is true of, generally, of companies in any industry. Whichever\ncompany has the highest rate of innovation, unless that company is actively killed by its competitors in\nsome way that's nefarious or shoots itself in the foot, it will, at some point, exceed those competitors. Like\nthis is obvious that this would occur with Amazon or Walmart, because Walmart's rate of innovation was\nnegligible and Amazon's was very high. The outcome was obvious a long time ago.\nGalileo Russell\nAnd in terms of the Megacharger, I noticed you guys are going to be selling energy at a fixed price for\nthose truck customers. So I'm wondering what the philosophy is there. Is it also you're going offer that at\ncost and reduce that energy price? Or are you thinking of that as a revenue stream for the company?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nWe haven't really talked about any of that and haven't finalized, frankly, any of that. It's -- we want to\nmake sure that there's a very seamless and easy system to operate trucks wherever they need to go. And\nsome customers may elect to work with us on the whole system or parts of it. But I think there's a lot of\ndifferent ways that, that can be solved.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. I mean, for sure, with commercial trucking like a heavy-duty Semi, economics are fundamental\nto that situation. We're not making decisions based on aesthetics or consumer-related things. We're\n-- like we made our -- we're trying to make our Semi kind of cool and sexy just because we think that\nthat's a good thing to do, not because it affects the buying decision of our customers in a meaningful\nway. It doesn't really move the needle. I mean, there was like a laughable lawsuit recently from some\ncompany ironically called Nikola. It's like Nikola is suing Tesla. That's hilarious. Fate loves the irony. And\n-- but they're like suing us because of the way the trucks look, which is absurd. Nobody's buying a Semi\ntruck because of the way it looks or because it's got like a wraparound windshield or whatever, please.\nSo the economics are incredibly important. And so we have to make sure that the Superchargers or\nMegachargers, whatever you call them, or the trucks are set up in a way that you'd have very low cost of\nelectricity.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nI mean, one maybe slightly related point to that, that I think is super exciting about this is the potential to\nlink up renewable energy generation at a very fixed and also very affordable cost to power future trucking\nfleets. Ultimately, that can give customers an incredibly deterministic cost per mile that will not change\nwith the price of petroleum over decades, which is really, really an interesting proposition for a trucking\ncustomer. And that's something that we're pretty excited about.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, exactly. It's really worth emphasizing that. For trucking companies, like if the cost of diesel goes\nup a few cents, it just like destroys their business. And whereas with the sort of Megacharger situation,\ncombining -- having basically a solar battery-powered Megacharger, we have -- there are constant costs\nand we know what they are; we bake them in. And yes, it's very predictable and lower cost per mile thanTESLA, INC. FQ1 2018 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 02, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 19a diesel truck. And fundamentally, it's like what is the cost per mile kilometer of cargo? And that drives the\ncommercial trucking market. You can have the ugliest truck in the world and it still would be victorious.\nGalileo Russell\nYes. And building on that, do you have any thoughts on how the trucking market could change or\npotentially grow if you guys are actually able to deliver on dramatic cost reduction, especially with things\nlike platooning?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nI think it will take away quite a bit of revenue from railway because the reason rail's heavily competitive\nis it's effectively just platooning with lots of railcars. And you need only a small crew to operate the train.\nHowever, trains don't go everywhere. So you have to like have a truck to deliver things to the train rail\nspur and then pick stuff -- pick it up. And then at the destination, the truck's got to pick it up from the rail\nspur over there. So you still have trucks plus train plus transfer. So I think platooning of trucks will quite\ndramatically affect the rail industry in a negative way.\nGalileo Russell\nOkay. Last one, I promise. On Tesla Energy, I assume that you guys are basically supply constrained, not\ndemand constrained on that side of the business. So I'm wondering how you're prioritizing residential\nversus utility scale. And in particular, how has this successful project in South Australia sort of changed the\nindustry's perception of what batteries can do?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, I think it's had quite a profound effect. The -- there's -- South Australia took a chance on doing\nthe world's biggest battery. That's worked out really well. If you read the articles, it's worked out far\nbeyond their expectations because the battery's able to respond at the millisecond level, far faster than\nany hydrocarbon plant. And so it's value and good stabilization is much greater actually than even a gas\nturbine plant, which can normally respond quite fast. So it's kind of like you get in a Tesla and you can --\nyou have that instant acceleration. Feels like you like have -- also like a mind meld with the car. It's just\nlike the car is you. And then that same rapid response is true of the battery pack. So the customers that --\nthe utilities that worked with us thus far have really loved the battery pack. And I feel confident that we'll\nbe able to announce a deal at the gigawatt-hour scale within a matter of months. So it's a 1,000 gigawatts\n-- megawatt-hours -- 1,000 megawatt-hours for [ zeroing gigawatt-hours ].\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes, maybe just for the first part of your question also, it is absolutely accurate that we are still -- there's\nmore than enough demand. And we are still building under our demand backlog and actually increasing it\nslightly. And we're trying to do our best to prioritize customers between residential Powerwall and utility\nand commercial. I'd say our longer-term strategy is to shift a little bit of our focus and really catch up on\nour Powerwall demand backlog, which is quite -- it's too long right now. We know people are waiting too\nlong. So that's -- I think that's generally the direction we're trying to take that. But Model 3 has taken a\nlot of focus in the last few quarters, and that trend is going to be reversing in the second half of the year.\nMartin Viecha\nLet's go to the next question, please."

Can you give us any color from what you're\nseeing in your data as it relates to the confidence that your consumers have in the Autopilot functionality,\nwhether they've used it more or less frequently in their existing vehicles or whether they've opted to\npurchase the functionality more or less in lieu of these accidents? Because we're really trying to get ahead\na sense of consumer sort of -- the ability or the likelihood of consumers to adopt this technology over\ntime. So this would be very helpful.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWe do see a steady increase in the number of percentage of miles driven with using Autopilot. As we roll\nout more functionality, as we make it better, we see a steady increase. I think it's something -- for cars\nequipped with Autopilot, something on the order of 1/3 of highway miles, maybe closer -- maybe 1/2\nin some cases are -- in some regions are on Autopilot. But then, of course, when there's like negative\nnews in the press, then that dips. And then I was like, \"Okay, this is not good because people are reading\nthings in the press that cause them to use Autopilot less, and then that makes it dangerous for our\ncustomers and that's not cool.\" That's why I get upset. And then we get accused of blaming the victim.\nI was like, \"Look, we're not blaming the victim here, but it is important that people not be under the\nwrong impression.\" The statistics are unequivocal that Autopilots improve safety. No question. In fact, one\nthing I was going to mention, forgot to but also going to mention, is that we'll be publishing our safety\nstatistics on a quarterly basis so people know exactly what Autopilot safety is. Is it getting better? Is\nit getting worse? And it's like, look, coloring those impressions is that when there is a serious accident\non Autopilot, people, for some reason, think that -- or some of the articles think that it's because the\ndriver thought the car was fully autonomous and it wasn't, and we somehow misled them into thinking\nit was fully autonomous. It is the opposite case. When there is a serious accident, it is almost always,\nin fact, maybe always the case that it is an experienced user. And the issue is what -- more one ofTESLA, INC.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 22complacency, like we get too used to it, that tends to be more of an issue. It's not a lack of understanding\nof what Autopilot can do. It's actually thinking they know more about Autopilot than they do, like quite a\nsignificant understanding of it, but there's less, [ maybe less ].\nJames Joseph Albertine\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\nJust to clarify, Elon, so you've got 2 accidents spaced out pretty far. You've had dips during those periods\nwhen the accidents occurred. But to clarify your comments, you are increasing use -- you're seeing\nincreasing usage and you've weathered those dips based on where we are today?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nThat is correct."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird.\nBenjamin Joseph Kallo\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nSo I remember the Barron's story, I don't know if it was fake news or not, which you hung up on\nabout your battery cost. And I don't want to ask a mundane question, so -- but I think it's important\nbecause one of your stakeholders are shareholders right now. And so far, we've had a couple pushouts\nin production. And is there a way that you can update us when you get to that 3,000 number or 4,000\nnumber per week? I mean, you -- you're active on Twitter. Can you just let us know? Because -- we're\ngoing to have a big vacuum here and there's a lot of news flow out there that makes volatility into the\nstock. It makes it hard for people to own even though you have a lot of believers out there. And so even\nthough it would be in my office right now, I think it's very important to get those kind of updates. And so\nthat's -- I think that's my question. Can you give us an update when you get to 3,000 and 4,000 per week\non the Model 3?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. Actually, the -- what's -- Tesla's such a leaky server of information that I think the news will leak\npretty quickly. Also people track registrations very closely. So at most, any information that we provide\nwould be 1 week or 2 in advance of what will become public knowledge just due to vehicle registrations\nand shipments that are tracked very carefully. So that really, the problem is like people get too focused\non like what's happening in the space of a few weeks or a few months. This is -- it's an old maxim of\ninvesting, you should not be focused on short-term things. You should be focused on long-term things. We\nhave no interest in satisfying the desires of day traders, like we couldn't care less. Please sell our stock\nand don't buy it.\nBenjamin Joseph Kallo\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nI completely understand your frustrations, and I'm frustrated too on how myopic we are right now.\nThey also say that great years are made out of quarters and great decades are made out of years. So\neveryone's short-term focused in some ways ,and volatility has a way of taking people out even if they are\nstrong and want to be there. And so anything you can to do to help in the near term on that, I think it's\nhelpful for the stock.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nI mean, I think that if people are concerned about volatility, they should definitely not buy our stock. I am\nnot here to convince you to buy our stock. Do not buy it if volatility is scary. There you go.TESLA, INC.

And let's go to our last question now."

        "paragraph": "Our last question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.\nAlexander Eugene Potter\nPiper Jaffray Companies, Research Division\nNot sure if this is going to be a hard question to answer. You mentioned Model 3 market share versus\nthe 3 Series and others in that segment. To what extent do you think Model 3 is, I guess, changing the\ndenominator, making that segment larger as a class versus what it used to be?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nI think it will probably increase the total number of sedans purchased, yes. Yes, I think so.\nAlexander Eugene Potter\nPiper Jaffray Companies, Research Division\nSo you think you're pulling ex Accord buyers and Camry buyers into that class, as example?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, we know this because of the trade-ins. So we see quite a wide range of cars [indiscernible] a lot of\ntrading in the cars. They're not necessarily owners of a C-Class or an Audi A4 or a 3 Series.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nWe saw signs of trade-in with Model S, so with Model 3 it's going to be even more prominent.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, yes, exactly. And I think -- like also, once we get to like the shared autonomy, ride-hailing thing, we\n-- it could be as soon as the end of next year, but that's already technically ready. But then not long after\nthat, I would expect some jurisdictions to give regulatory approval. The effective cost of ownership of a\nModel 3 or Tesla drops dramatically because you can share that car with others.\nAlexander Eugene Potter\nPiper Jaffray Companies, Research Division\nOkay. Very interesting. Last one. You mentioned earlier, you think the Model Y production is going to be a\ntrue sort of production revolution. If you had to do the Model 3 over again, there are some things that you\nwould have changed, and you hope to incorporate those learnings into the Model Y. What specifically would\nyou do or what specifically do you plan to do?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWell, I think let's save that for another time. Like we'll talk about that when we unveil the Model Y. But it's\nreally going to be dramatically better. The design and production system, I think, really will be next level.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\n[indiscernible] bottom line.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2018 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 02, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

Appreciate the good questions.\nMartin Viecha\nOkay. It's unfortunately all the time we have, so thank you very much, and speak to you next quarter.\nThank you very much, and goodbye."
