        "paragraph6": "Elon, over to you.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nAll right. Thank you. My apologies. We actually tried a new audio system with a bunch of individual mics.\nThat seems to have malfunctioned, so we went back to standard conference call object. Anyway, just want\nto confirm, people can hear what I am saying. Okay, great.\nSo first of all, let me say that Friday night was an amazing time for Tesla. It was the -- one of the most\nimportant days in the history of the company. It's one we've been striving for, for 14 years. It's the car\nthat we've -- the Model 3 -- hanging with us [ 30 ] production Model 3s was just an incredible milestone in\nthe company's history. We wanted to make a great, affordable electric car, which is the fundamental thing\nthat is missing.\nWe wanted to make that from day one. And if we could only have done it sooner, we would have. And I'm\nglad that this day has come. What we have ahead of us, of course, is an incredibly difficult production\nramp. Nonetheless, I think we've got a great team. And I'm very confident that we'll be able to reach a\nproduction rate of 10,000 vehicles per week towards the end of next year. And we remain, we believe, on\ntrack to achieve a 5,000-unit week by the end of this year.\nSo I would simply urge people to not get too caught up in what exactly falls within the exact calendar\nboundaries of a quarter, one quarter over the next, because when you have an exponentially growing\nproduction ramp, slight changes of a few weeks here or there can appear to have dramatic changes, but\nthat is simply because of the arbitrary nature of the -- of when a quarter ends.\nSo -- but what people should absolutely have 0 concern about, 0, is that Tesla will achieve a 10,000-unit\nproduction week by the end of next year. So if you can associate where we came from, the Roadster, we\nwere making only 600 units a week, where the nonpowertrain portion of the car was made by Lotus. And\nwe did the powertrain and the final assembly of the car, and then we went from that to 20,000 units a\nyear of the Model S, a far more complex car where we did the whole thing. And then we -- with Model 3,\nwe were more vertically integrated. I think people should really not have any concerns that we won't reach\nthat outcome from a production rate.\nWe're also very confident about costs. We feel we gained a lot of experience. We certainly aspire to\nlearn from mistakes of the past. And I think we largely have. Deepak will go into some of our margin\nexpectations there. And unlike, say for example, the Model X, where the mistake that we made, I\nobviously take primary responsibility here, was having far too much advanced technology in version 1 of a\nproduct, it's an -- Model X is an incredible car, but it was overreaching for the first generation of a product.\nBut in the case of the Model 3, we've strived hard to simplify and make sure that it has everything that's\nnecessary to be a fantastic car. If you see the reviews, the reviews are -- you really could -- one could not\nask for better reviews.\nAnd I'll just sort of give you one little anecdote, which was -- which I found quite surprising is that when\nwe were giving test drives to -- or tests -- the journalists were doing -- were driving the car and doing test\ndrives. About 80% of the journalists said that they would buy the car themselves. Most of the remaining\n20% said probably. This is crazy. I've never seen anything like it. So this is a very good sign.TESLA, INC. FQ2 2017 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 02, 2017\nIt should also be noted that one of our big concerns was that Model S, particularly, and Model X demand\nwould suffer with the introduction of the 3. In fact, this has turned out to be the opposite situation. Model\nS and X demand increased with the release of 3.\nJon, would you like to just elaborate on that? There was -- we did express this as a concern, and it was a\nbig concern, but it has turned out to be a pleasant surprise.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nYes, I think that's right. Not only, as Elon said, we expressed it as a concern. We had positive comps both\nyear-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and in orders in the second quarter. But since then, orders have\naccelerated in July as we noted in our shareholder letter. And it accelerated further since the handover\nevent on Friday for the Model 3.\nSo it kind of shows that S and X as our flagship products have a strong position in the market and strong\ndemand. And that's super encouraging that we've got those -- a strong product lineup with 3 cars that are\nproving to be very popular in their individual segments.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. In fact, I don't know -- I think we mentioned some of this in the earnings letter ,but just some of the\nkey stats on July orders for S and X were...\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nYes. July orders were 15% higher than our Q2 average weekly order rate, so we've accelerated off of Q2\ninto July. And as we noted in the shareholder letter, deliveries grew by 53% compared to the Q2 '16 in\na flat luxury vehicle market. So we're gaining share in a flat to market down -- to down market, and the\norder rate's accelerated.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. So July was one of our best months ever.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nYes.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nAgain, contrary to our expectations, I want to emphasize. Of course, we know who knows if this will\ncontinue, but all indications are that it will, so that's very exciting.\nAs a side note, we're also making great progress on our internal Autopilot software. It's getting better and\nbetter. I'm really, really excited. I test drive the latest development release as soon as it comes out, and\nI'm like, this is really getting to be something special. Because, yes, it's really -- and I think it's going to\naccelerate from here. And the talent that we're seeing drawing on the technical side for Autopilot is really\nworld class. I don't think there's -- it's unmatched anywhere, I would say.\nSo let's see then. Model 3 orders are -- net-net orders, there's not that many cancelations, there are\nabout 1,800 a day. It's important to emphasize, there -- you can't see the car unless you want to look at\npictures online, you can't test drive the car. You have to put down a $1,000 deposit.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & ServiceTESLA, INC. FQ2 2017 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 02, 2017\nWe're not promoting the car.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWe're not promoting the car. If you go to our stores, we don't even want to talk about it really and --\nbecause we want to talk to about the thing that we can supply. If somebody orders a Model 3 now, it's\nprobably late next year before they get it. We want to give people the car, orders to take maybe a 1- or 2-\nmonth wait for an S or an X. And I think the point that we're trying to make that the S is still a superior\nsedan seems to come through -- and it is true. Things get a little confusing because of the nomenclature\nof being Model 3, but Model S and X, which is I guess sort of my fault being too quick -- too clever for my\nown good there, because it was supposed to be the Model E. As you can tell, I have a wonderful sense of\nhumor, and -- but then people mistook that for generation 3. But in fact, if you look at, say -- what we're\nreally on right now, I would say is approximately generation 4. But we're on generation 4 of S, X and 3 at\nthe risk of really confusing matters. Model 3 is generation 4 and so -- but so are S and X. We evolve the\ntechnology all at the same time. So overall looking really good.\nAnd then Solar Roof. We have installed and working the Solar Roof tiles. I have it on my house. J.B. has\nit on his house. We have -- I think we included some of the pictures in the earnings letter. I want to be --\nI want to emphasize those are un -- the roof, there's no Photoshop-ing on the roof. That is actually how\nit looks. And it wasn't taken by some amaze -- it was like take some pics with your phone and send them\nover. That's what we're talking about here, not some special lighting conditions, pro photographer art\nsituation. And this is version 1. I think this roof's going to look really knockout as we just keep iterating.\nNow it is a very challenging technical task to get this right, get the cost good, streamline the installation\nprocess, ramp up the production. Again, this is sort of -- it follows some of the S-curve to vehicles where it\nstarts up very slow -- it starts up very slow, but then it grows exponentially.\nAlso, our conventional solar is doing quite well and generating significant positive cash flow, just put\nstandard flat panel stuff, which I think is solar the right solution for any product to -- for any kind of flat\nroof situation, which is most commercial installations and a lot of houses or some part of the roof which is\nreally not visible and, therefore, does not have any aesthetic -- it doesn't really matter from an aesthetic\nstandpoint.\nAnd then batteries are also making great, great progress in the battery front. Yes, I'm hoping to do\nsomething around the International Astronautical Congress, which is in Adelaide this year, but not\npromising anything. But we're aspirationally going to have a very substantial portion of the battery\npack already done in about 8 weeks, which is hard because this -- we have all the shipping and logistic\nchallenges of getting things across the Pacific. I'm not promising anything. it's an aspirational goal. Team's\nworking super hard to make it happen. But I'm excited by the prospect, and I feel, of course, optimistic\nthat, that will take place.\nSo yes, really, I think -- and we're really proud of the Tesla team for getting to this point. And we want to\nthank the whole Tesla team. We already have 33,000 people at this point who are working hard to achieve\nsome very difficult things. And I can be proud of working with such a great team.\nSo let's maybe go to -- anything else you want to add, guys? Otherwise, let's go to questions.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nAll right. Sharie, let's open it up to Q&A. ["

        "paragraph9": "Our first question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge Research.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\nCongratulations on the first 30 deliveries last week. It was a great event. Wanted to ask, if I may, my one\nquestion on capital expenditures. Wanted to get an idea. What comes next with respect to some of your\nspending on the Model 3? And then, I guess, if I can nest one in related to Gigafactory. It's one question\non CapEx but really want to understand what the big next steps are in 3Q and 4Q as we start to kind of\nbuild out our models and figure it out from there.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nCertainly. I mean, I do want to emphasize, like, the -- a lot of this is actually very hard for us to know.\nWhen we make mistakes, it's because we're stupid not because we're trying to mislead anyone. I just\nwant to emphasize, I, we, sort of we aspire to be less dumb over time. So if I knew it, I would tell you.\nIt's sort of like I've got this like secret hand of cards that I'm holding close to my vest, and I'm not telling\nyou. It's just fundamentally impossible to predict the exponential part of the manufacturing S-curve. It's\ncrazy hard. And S-curve is a simplification because it's really running through a series of constraints that,\nif you -- and so it's like a really jagged sort of upward growth, and it'll plateau, and then it'll grow rapidly,\nand it'll plateau again. And then some sometimes it'll go backwards because something broke. Well, when\nI said manufacturing hell on -- and supply chain hell on Friday, I meant it. I mean -- but we know this.\nSigned up for it, not blaming hell because we bought the ticket. So I -- but I think at a high level, I don't\nthink we should expect any significant negative surprises. There will be -- as you look at the case, there\ntends to be some cost growth in CapEx for unexpected things. We've got to expedite this. You've got to fix\nthat. Or this supplier doesn't work out. Or this machine we bought doesn't work out. And you've got to be\nall hands on deck 24/7 to fix it or replace it. But I don't expect any significant -- I think that it's relatively\ncontained. Deepak, do you want to...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, I mean, I think maybe the other way, James, to answer your question is...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYou may need to talk close to this.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, I think you're asking where we're spending the money. I think it's in the completion of the Model 3.\nWe are paying off on the equipment. And also we're just continuing with the construction of Gigafactory to\ncontinue to scale that, and so that's where majority of our capital...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nOverwhelmingly. Let's be fair. Overwhelmingly is Model 3. Obviously, there are expenditures associated\nwith Solar Roof, and with our Buffalo factory, we're trying to keep those relatively light for the next few\nmonths.\nDeepak AhujaTESLA, INC. FQ2 2017 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 02, 2017\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. And the marketing and sales are growing our infrastructure there and our Supercharging networks, so\nthose are the other small pieces.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. But just on Buffalo, if I may, I really want to emphasize we expect the Buffalo Gigafactory to be a\npowerhouse of solar panel and solar glass tile output. It is going to be a kickass facility. We've made that\ncommitment to the state of New York. We are going to keep that. commitment. So -- and then we're also\nthinking hard about where do we put Gigafactories 3, 4, 5 and 6. We expect to keep the majority of our\nproduction in the U.S. and -- but, it's obviously going to make sense to establish a Gigafactory in China\nand Europe, just to serve the markets there because it's not too -- [indiscernible] in California and truck\nthem halfway around the world, particularly when you're trying to make things as affordable as possible,\nthat really hurt. We really want to get -- make our cars as affordable as possible, and so that does require\nsome amount of local market production, particularly for the mass market vehicles in order to make it as\naccessible as possible. So we think hard about that. I think we'll have some announcements on at least a\nfew of those locations before the end of the year. But we don't expect to spend significant money on them.\nJust it's identifying the location, doing the long lead-time stuff, the permits, the planning. This doesn't cost\na lot of money. It's only when you really start moving dirt and putting up concrete and steel and buying\nequipment that the big money starts to be required. Yes. So, anything you want to add on that?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nIt's good.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nCapEx on Model S and X is pretty -- it's like really not -- it's minor compared to -- yes, yes, yes. There\nis continued improvement, of course, to keep pace with Model 3 so that all of our products aren't of the\nsame level of technology, but it's small potatoes compared to the Model 3.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd you're continuing to achieve cost reductions in S and X, so there's a bit of investment but\n[indiscernible].\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, exactly. Absolutely. And in cases where we see cost reductions in S and X, there are cases where we\nwant to pass along some those cost reductions to customers. So yes, so overall feeling really -- this is like\nmaybe the best I've ever felt about Tesla, to be frank. It's like really -- I mean, last week stressed the\nhell out of me, but I really think that this is -- this is probably the best I've ever felt about the company.\nAnd -- oh and one thing I wanted to correct. I think in a prior call, publicly I had said that Model Y or our\ncompact SUV, which is called Model Y, may or may not be -- would be totally architecture. I've gone -- I've\ndecided -- well, upon the counsel of my executive team, thank you, thank you, thanks, guys, who reeled\nme back from the Cliffs of Insanity, much appreciated, the Model Y will, in fact, be using a substantial\ncarryover from Model 3 in order to bring it to market faster. Yes. So that will really accelerate our ability to\nget Model Y to market faster for -- because it's fundamentally to -- you have people who prefer a sedan,\npeople who prefer an SUV and, in fact, the SUV market is larger which is the biggest single [ proximity ]\nI believe in the world. So which I thank my executive team for stopping me from being a fool. And yes.\nSo Model Y, what the hell, will be -- have relatively low technical and production reschedule result. I still\nthink we want to do the crazy thing in the future, but we will pump that too after the model -- until after\nthe compact SUV. Anything else that you think [indiscernible]. So yes, we'll try to leave as much timeTESLA, INC. FQ2 2017 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 02, 2017\nfor questions as we can. We have a lot of operational issues to get back to but like to make work on that\nmanufacturing ramp, and I'm always incredibly grateful for anyone who has -- who is an investor in Tesla.\nYou put your faith in us. We will do whatever is necessary to reward that faith."

        "paragraph10": "Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nI was going to ask you which is harder, AI or AV. But I think at this point, we may not know the answer.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, as you know, I'm terrified of AI.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nI've read that.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, you may have heard that in a few places, and it's just something we -- anyway, I definitely don't\nwant to rail the conversation on that front. It's just something that I think anything that represents --\nthat is a risk to the public deserves at least insight from the government because one of the mandates\nof the government is the public well-being, and that's -- insight is different from oversight. So it's just --\nat least the government can gain insight to understand what's going on and then decide what rules are\nappropriate to ensure public safety. That is what I'm advocating for. I'm not advocating for that we stop\ndevelopment of AI or any of the sort of [indiscernible] hyperbole, things that have been written, I do think\nthere are great benefits to AI. We just need to make sure that they are indeed benefits and we don't do\nsomething really dumb.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nOkay. Well, I hope that doesn't count against my Tesla questions. But the 2 things I was going to ask\nyou were you mentioned in the letter this confidence in getting the 25% margin on Model 3. Could you\njust mention what the level of production is that you feel you need to get to in order to get there? What\nrun rate? And secondly, there have been a fair number of battery announcements, solid-state battery\ntechnology, Toyota and a few others. Can you -- what's your general assessment. Are we getting close to\nsome kind of breakthroughs here or just what's your thoughts?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nOh, God. Okay, here's my opinion of the battery breakthrough of the week, battery breakthrough du\njour. When somebody has like some great claim that they've got this awesome battery, you know what?\nSend us a sample. Or if you don't trust us, send it to an independent lab where the parameters can be\nverified. Otherwise, STF. Yes. So everything works on PowerPoint. If you like, I'll give you a PowerPoint\npresentation about teleportation to the Andromeda Galaxy. That doesn't mean it works. So Tesla is the\nbiggest buyer of lithium-ion batteries on earth. You know who people come to first when they've got\na lithium-ion battery? Us. Because we're their biggest customer. I would love it if we could have some\nbreakthrough. It'd be awesome. I think there are some interesting things on the horizon, but then the\ntime it takes from something working in the lab to working at moderate production levels, to working\nat high production levels, to optimizing the cost is several years. So it's not like it suddenly pops out of\nnowhere. J.B., do you want to add to that?TESLA, INC. FQ2 2017 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 02, 2017\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nI totally agree with the sort of cautious skepticism on all these announcements. And just more specifically\non the solid-state batteries, Rod. I mean, we do -- we've talked to a number of different groups that are\nresearching this. We actually have tested a number of those different prototype -- very early prototype\nsingle cells. But it's -- we don't yet see anything that changes our strategy, and we don't see anything\nthere that's...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nHowever, we'd love it if it did. Pretty please. Can someone please come up with a battery breakthrough.\nWe'd love it.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nWe would be the first ones to want to implement it.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. Totally. I mean, there are some breakthroughs that I think are achievable. I -- they're confidential, so\nI can't talk about them on this call. But there's one particular avenue that I am confident could be made to\nwork that would be not -- from a -- the most significant one -- breakthrough in a while. But again, you've\ngot to make it work in the lab. It doesn't yet work in the lab. It's promising in the lab. You go from the lab\nto small production, then you go to large production, then you get to cost optimization. These are several\nyears, okay. I wish it was shorter, but that's the way it goes. So don't worry about that. And yes, so was\nthere...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nThe 25% Model 3 gross margin target. When will we get there?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. So J.B. might want to elaborate on this, but I feel like the point at which we are at steady-state 5,000\nunits a week for Model 3 is about when we've reached the 25% gross margin level. So it wouldn't be\nright when we get to 5,000 because initially when you get to 5,000 a week, there's still a lot of overtime.\nYou're still expediting parts from all around the world. So you've a lot of expedite fees. You've got a lot\nof overtime, and so it takes probably from the point at which you get to the 5,000 a week, it's probably\nanother 3 or 4 months before you hit the 25% gross margin. Would you agree, Deepak?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nI agree. You're -- yes, I was just going to be more cautious. But I think\u2026\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIt's something like that. It's certainly -- you need to reach a production level and then optimize at that\nproduction level.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ2 2017 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 02, 2017\nYes, I mean, I think ultimately it's a variety of factors, including material cost and cell and the efficiencies\nwe achieve at the Gigafactory and ourselves. And I'm -- we are very confident we will achieve the 25%\ntarget, firstly on Model 3.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nFor sure next year. 100%.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nIt's a question of actually when 100%...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nAgain, I say 100% probability of achieving that at some point next year.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. And I feel really good about it because the bill of material that we have is so well defined and so clear\nin our premiums that we on prototypes is [indiscernible].\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nAnother way of saying we're significantly less dumb this time, we think.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. So and the labor hours required are significantly lower, there will be a structured manufacturing.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIt's designed for manufacturing.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nExactly. And so all of those give me much more confidence in this target. And exactly when we'll achieve, I\nthink we'll give you more clarity over time.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. And I'd like to give some credit to our suppliers here. With Roadster, and certainly with Model S and\nto a slightly less degree with Model X, yes, we often could not get the top suppliers or -- and we certainly\ncouldn't get the A-Team at the top suppliers. What's great about the Model 3 is we have the A supplier and\nwe have the A-Team at the A supplier. I can't tell you how important this is. It makes a massive difference.\nSo just a thank you to all the suppliers that work so hard to get us to this point. There's a lot of credit for\nany success that we have.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes."

        "paragraph11": "Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan.\nRyan J. Brinkman\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nIn just thinking about your liquidity position, while you're operating with more cash than you historically\nhave, $3 billion, I see you're also guiding to $2 billion CapEx in the back half and you previously said\n$1 billion of gross cash is as low as you're comfortable operating at. So you guide to positive cash from\noperations the back half, presumably on your Model 3 ramp in 4Q. But if it's only a little positive, then\nI guess you would be close to your targeted cash level. So the question is can you help us size of how\npositive do you expect the cash from operations to be in the back half? And if that level of cash from\noperations plus whatever remains available to draw on your asset-backed line, if that's sufficient cushion\nfor you relative to your $1 billion target or whether it might make sense to do another equity raise?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. Deepak, do you want to...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, sure, sure, Ryan. So we expect our operating cash flows to be significantly better in the second half\ncompared to the first half. At their highest level, scaling generates cash.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, it certainly does.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd it's a better situation in S and X. And our cash conversion cycle, particularly for the next full quarter is\ngoing to be really great while we are shipping Model 3s in North America. And in addition...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nAnd one thing, perhaps to try to get to it is -- is that the -- with Model 3, with our suppliers, we've been\nable to get -- negotiate much better terms, payment terms. The payment terms are significantly longer.\nSo I think we're close to, is that 60?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nClose to 60, correct.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nClose to 60 days payment terms with our suppliers. The -- and we are also able to make the car a lot\nfaster. So obviously, the nirvana is that we can make the car and get paid for the car before we have to\npay our suppliers, which then the faster you grow, the faster your cash position grows. Obviously that's\nlike the promised land right there. And that's how it's -- what certainly that's how it's -- what we've aimed\nfor. And I think we will achieve that, maybe not immediately, but pretty quickly. Now that said, there may\nbe some wisdom in having a cash cushion for unexpected events. You just never know if there's going\nto be some significant force majeure events in the world. It could be an earthquake in California, for\nexample. And -- but we're not, at this point, considering an equity raise. We are thinking about debt, but\nwe're not thinking about an equity raise.\nRyan J. BrinkmanTESLA, INC. FQ2 2017 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 02, 2017\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nOkay. That's very helpful. And then just the follow-up is about the $1 billion of desired minimum gross\ncash. Does that go up when the Model 3 launches because you're a bigger company? Or does it go down\nbecause of what you just said about the ability to generate cash and working capital while production is\nramping?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nIn the long run, it will go up as our balance sheet grows. And just to finish off on your question, we also\nhave liquidity through the lines of credit, our ABL line is -- we've just grown it to $1.9 billion. We have\nuntapped $800 million there. Of course, how much we can tap there depends on our borrowing base but\nthat's a source of liquidity. And then for our solar leased assets, we have $700 million of funding which is\nuntapped on our tax equity funds and aggregation debt. So we have significant amounts of liquidity to be\nable to fund those lines through.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. One side point that's perhaps worth nothing is that as long as people look at our sort of finished\ngoods inventory and compare that to other car companies, but they compare it in the wrong way. Because\nTesla does direct distribution, we are the dealers. You really -- to accurately compare Tesla to other car\ncompanies, you must include the finished goods inventory, not just at the car companies, but at the\ndealers. And typically, the -- that combined time of finished goods from manufacturer all the way through\nto dealer to an end customer is, I believe, on the order of 90 days. So it may be 70 to 90 days.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nFor other OEMs.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nFor the other OEMs, yes. And for us, that same metric would be approximately 30. So this is a -- in other\nwords, at a systemic level, we're substantially more efficient than other carmakers when you consider the\nsystem as a whole."

Elon, you're putting a liquid cooled supercomputer in all of your\ncars. You're obviously ramping up more and more of those. Whether the system is being activated or not,\nit's collecting data, learning, you're getting better every mile. I imagine you're in a position to kind of\nshare that data with the public or the regulators or Congress, whoever, where it matters. I haven't seen an\nannouncement since the 40% reduction in accidents from NHTSA back in January. When could we be in a\nposition to hear some more on this?\nElon R.

It's actually quite a\nchallenge to process that data and then train against that data and have the vehicle learn effectively from\nthe data, because it's just a vast quantity of data. I do want to emphasize that this is disaggregated from\nthe specific vehicle.

Yes, obviously, over time an autonomous vehicle is going to be far, far safer than a person. Yes,\nit's just -- it's really hard for a person to compete. I mean the car has 8 cameras looking 360 degrees all\nthe time. It's got a board radar, it's got 12 high-precision ultrasonic sonars. It's got inertial measurement\nunits, high-accuracy GPS.

Come on.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nNo, it's actually -- it's really relevant. I was just curious is there anything that SpaceX is doing that -- or\nenabling that could be advantageous to Tesla's mission to accelerate sustainable transport?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nThere's a recent anecdote actually that Jon just shared with me. Jon, maybe you...\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nYes, there's some really great collaboration continuously between the SpaceX teams on materials and\nother challenges. And we had a challenge in service over the past -- just over the past weeks.\nElon R.

Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. This cross-fertilization of knowledge from the rocket and SpaceX history to auto back and forth is -- I\nthink has really been quite valuable. It's something that's been very valuable for me in thinking about how\ndo we make mass optimized vehicles, because space, mass optimization is extremely important. On the\nspace side, it's helpful because it -- what really goes into high-volume manufacturing of something that\nhas to be extremely reliable. So it's been good.

        "paragraph13": "Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nHow do you come up with your estimate for the number of Superchargers and dealers that you need?\nBecause you're doubling the number of the base, the number of Superchargers, according to the release.\nBut the 3 is going to have a multiple higher in terms of demand. So I mean how do you -- yes, how do\nyou frame that and gauge that?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. First of all, actually I should clarify that the number of Superchargers will, in fact, triple between\nnow and the end of next year. And that's -- we're confident that, that will address the Supercharging\nneeds of S, X and 3. So we're trying to stay ahead of it. There are occasional places where -- that are\ntricky to find a location, like Malibu's really difficult. A few places. But the -- we're staying ahead of that.\nI think it's going to be good. We should see some immediate relief, impress the next customers on some\nof the key Supercharger locations. We'll also be experimenting with our first sort of, I don't recall, mega\nSupercharger location, like a really big Supercharger location with a bunch of amenities. So we're going to\nunveil the first of those relatively soon. I think we'll get a sense for just sort of how cool it can be to have\na great place to -- if you've been driving for 3, 4 hours, stop, have great restrooms, great food, amenities,\nhang out and for half an hour and then be on your way.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nAnd if I could just follow up with a related question...\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nWell, maybe just one other point on that and how this can scale pretty efficiently. We have Superchargers\nthat serve 2 major separate needs. There's long-distance route enabling between cities and then there's\nalso within the cities. And while there are definitely some congestion issues, which we're expanding out\nof very quickly in the cities, for the most part, the Superchargers that are in between cities have a lot\nof extra capacity. And we've put those stations in place to serve travel between the cities, but they can\nabsorb a lot more cars. So even if we double fleet size, it doesn't mean that we need to double the entire\nSupercharge network. We have to address the few urban sites that are currently in high use, but that can\nbe done much more efficiently with less CapEx. So that's kind of what you're seeing.\nColin LanganTESLA, INC. FQ2 2017 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 02, 2017\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nAnd what about, just as a follow-up, the charge time? I know Porsche has said that they could charge in\n15 minutes. Do you think that's possible in the future? And is the charge time on the 3 the same as the S?\nI wasn't sure with some of the release.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIt's about the same. Yes, it's comparable to the high-end S. Like your -- the recharge rate of how many\nmiles per hour you recharge is sort of your function of the battery pack size. So like a 100-kilowatt hour\npack -- because charge rate is as a function of percentage of packs. So think of 3 and the high-end S as\nbeing similar in charge rates. And over time, we want to keep moving that rate up. But they're similar.\nOne thing I want to correct from Friday, I don't think it really has much materiality, but I did misspeak\nat the generalist review on Friday. I had said that there were 500,000 net reservations. Well, I did also\nsay that I wasn't sure because I don't follow this number and that this was just a guess. And so we did\ncheck for the -- to get some precision on this. To be more accurate, there are -- there have been 518,000\ngross reservations for 3 and then -- and we have 455,000 net reservations. But those cancellations\noccurred over the course of more than a year. The net gain over the last -- net gain since Friday, net\nof cancellations, has been over 1,800 per day. But I just didn't want to leave people with the wrong\nimpression. I think this is like inconsequential because with a small amount of effort, we could easily\ndrive the Model 3 reservation number to something much higher, but there's no point. It's like if you're a\nrestaurant and you're serving hamburgers and there's like a 1.5 hour wait for the a hamburger, do you\nreally want to encourage more people to come order hamburgers? That doesn't make sense. So I think it's\nneither here nor there, but I wanted to just make sure that there was not a misunderstanding.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nAnd maybe just one quick point on your very fast charge time comment or question. We've actually tested\ncells and even full battery packs that can do something like a 15-minute recharge. But to-date, the trade-\noffs to achieve that, we don't feel are the right ones for the customer overall. You end up sacrificing on\noverall cost per kilowatt hour and also sacrificing on energy density in the product. And for something\nthat's used not every single day, not every single charge, we feel that we've kind of hit the sweet spot in\nterms of the value to the customer and the best product. And that's kind of what's guided our philosophy.\nBut obviously there's ongoing work to reduce those trade-offs and make it better still. But yes, we've been\npretty...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, but particularly if somebody buys like the 310-mile range Model 3, the amount -- let me tell you, the\namount of times you'll have range anxiety is 0.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nI have 1 question and 1 follow-up as well, please. In terms of the Model 3 at the delivery event, 20 of the\nunits were for engineering validation and the first several thousand, it appears, are going to be going to\nemployees prior to going to the general public. So I guess the question is what are you hoping to learn or\nwhat might you learn from these engineering validation units that have come out from your employees?\nAnd then realistically, just what's in the [indiscernible] going forward?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderTESLA, INC. FQ2 2017 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 02, 2017\nWell, they're not engineering validation units. They're fully certified, fully DOT approved, EPA approved\nproduction cars. These are not prototypes in any way. They're not validation anything. They are full\nproduction cars. The reason they are initially going to employees and, in some cases investors or anyone\nwho's been a long-time investor, is that for the first several thousand vehicles, there are problems that\ncrop up that are rare. On a percentage basis, they might be like 0.1% likely to occur, but then there are a\nwhole bunch of these things that only show up 1 in 1,000 cases. And it's good to iron out these things with\na tight internal feedback loop than to do it with customers. It also, to some degree, is our award for those\nwho work on the design, development, integration of the vehicle. Yes, yes.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nI mean, it's important to note, too, that all those people paid full price for the car.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, full price. There was no discount internally at all.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nExactly.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nRight. No, I mean, the root of the question is if you realistically uncover something, and even if it's 1 in\n1,000, what flexibility do you think you have to be actually be able to rectify that concern in a way that\nwon't impact your ramp? And if this is being done arguably later in a process than a traditional OEM that's\nnot trying to ramp necessarily as aggressively as you need to, I'm just -- again, just trying to understand\nrealistically what can be done and what kinds of things -- like perhaps you can give an example of what\nyou might uncover and what the rectification might be.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, these are not showstoppers. These are -- what we're talking about here are inconsistencies in the\nproduction process or in the quality control from a supplier. So they're relatively easy to correct. They're\njust -- there tends to be quite a large number of them. But again, only rarely occurring. It usually involves\nlike a tolerance stack up or some combination of factors that we didn't anticipate. But they're almost\nalways very easy to correct. But there are just a bunch of them and it's a lot of work.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. And these may be software issues as well, not necessarily supplier or hardware issues. It could...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, and software-hardware interaction as well.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. And I think the main benefit is that we can learn about them faster and therefore, we can fix them\nfaster. That simply is the benefit.\nElon R.

Can you\nshare a little bit more maybe what the 1Q and 2Q order rate trends looked like for the Model S and the X?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI don't think that those numbers would be helpful for predicting things in the future.

Fewer people order cars in the dead of winter than order them in\nspring or summer, there's just like other retailers really. So I'm -- and then we do batch cars so that we'll\nmake -- typically, at the beginning of the quarter, we'll make cars for Europe and Asia, and then we'll\nmake cars for the East Coast of North America, then the West Coast of North America, and that's generally\nthe sequence within a quarter. And then you'll see someone write something where they think they've\nuncovered some \"gotcha\" where there were very few Teslas registered in a given country in a particular\nmonth. It's like yes, because none of them have arrived. This is meaningless extrapolation.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Then I guess my follow-up question would just be on your 3Q gross margin guidance of a dip below\n20%. How far below -- to phrase correctly, how dependent upon production and hitting an S-curve or\nramping up do you think that below 20% is? Could it be a couple hundred basis points below 20% or is it\njust think you're going to be around that area based on what the curve that you've laid out so far is going\nto look like?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. This is just because of Model 3 is fundamentally negative gross margin in the very beginning, because\nyou've got a gigantic machine producing -- that's meant for 5,000 vehicles a week and it's producing a few\nhundred vehicles a week.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nExactly.

Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nPlease speak up. You're a bit soft. Yes.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nYes, the pace of OpEx through second half, you guided was flat. With the Model 3 going out, are you\nbasically saying you have the operating infrastructure to handle that, but then does that ramp in 2018?\nAnd similarly for CapEx to go from 30 Model 3s up to the exit rate, you're talking $2 billion. How do we\nthink about, a, that run rate and given how do we tie it to your exponential ramp? And b, what does that\nimply for CapEx going into 2018?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, so your first question was operating expenses?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nAnd do we have enough infrastructure in place to service the Model 3. And I think we're finally actually\nleveraging our own infrastructure and that's helping us. So I'll give you an example of that. In service, as\nwe've talked about, we discovered that 80% of the cars that we repair don't require a lift. And so we're\ndeploying a mobile service strategy to take 80% of the cars and fix them where it's convenient to the\ncustomer. Not at our location, at their location. Make it invisible to them.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. Exactly. Like the nice thing is like you -- like the ideal service is it's invisible. You don't even notice\nit and when it's done, you love it. And so what we're talking about here with the mobile service trucks,\nas Jon was saying, really most of the time we don't really need a lift, is that your car could be parked,TESLA, INC. FQ2 2017 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 02, 2017\nit could be at your office parking lot or at your house. But let's say it's like it's at work. The -- Tesla will\ncome there, fix your car and by the time you need to leave for work, it's done.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nThat's right. And so what that does for us is it takes 80% of the volume out of our existing footprint. And\nallows us to leverage that footprint to grow with Model 3. And we'd give you similar examples in stores. So\nthat's why we've guided to the OpEx that we've guided for the second half. We feel like we've got leverage\nthere and we've got plans in place to further lever that in 2018.\nElon R.

I mean, this is what you want.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nTotally.\nElon R.

So we're going to provide really great consumer happiness at increasing OpEx levels of leverage.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nAnd second question was similarly around CapEx leverage. So you put in $2 billion second half to get to\nthat exit rate. One, is that affected by the timing of Elon's production ramp? And then two, given the ramp\nfrom 5,000 to 10,000 in 2018, what's your preliminary view of CapEx for 2018?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nSo I want to put a pin on 2018. We'll talk about that when we get to that time. But in 2017, our CapEx\nexpense is a continuum. There are no -- there are long lead items of different kinds like the Gigafactory.\nAnd for the Model 3 and the equipment we are buying, our CapEx spend is at historical highs. We're\nspending $100 million a week. So a week or 2 here or there is a couple of hundred million. So what we are\nspending now is the completion of all of our Model 3 equipment and tooling as our -- that gets signed off\nand it's taking us to 5,000 and beyond. So I can't necessarily break it out for you but it just allows us to\nhit our operating plan that we have at a high level.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nI want to do a quick time check here. So some of us have some other things scheduled in 20 minutes. So\nwe've gotten some good, thorough answers here. So we'll probably take a few more questions and then\nwrap it up.\nElon R.

A lot of people don't realize that like there are many small utility\ninterruptions in a given month, and that's why your -- you see the blinking 12 on your microwave\noven or whatever, kids maybe, or your computer suddenly went dark and -- or you can even get data\ncorruption and that kind of thing. Or your food went bad mysteriously. The Powerwall saves you from all\nof that. And I think particularly important in cases where there's like a natural disaster, which could be\nfloods, hurricanes, ice storms, earthquakes, fires, anything that disrupts the utility system. But having\nuninterruptible power supply in the form of Powerwall gives you security in those situations. And it's kind\nof like insurance. Like you only really want it when you really want it. And I think people are going to -- a\nlot of that, \"I just saw the app for the first time today. I'm using it myself\" and it's like wow, this is great."

        "paragraph18": "Our next question comes from Martin Viecha with Redburn.\nMartin Viecha\nRedburn (Europe) Limited, Research Division\nI have just 2 very quick questions. The first one is on the battery production for S and X. Is there any plan\nto move it to the Gigafactory?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nFor pack production?\nMartin Viecha\nRedburn (Europe) Limited, Research Division\nRight.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\n[indiscernible] production. We do not -- in the short term, we will not be moving it. Depending -- so\nsometime next year, we may move it sometime next year in order to make space for additional production\nvolume of Model 3. That's one of the things under consideration. But in the short term, we're keeping\nit here in Fremont. But it is going to be tricky to squeeze in all of the space for increased Model 3\nproduction, particularly if that run rate goes above 10,000 units a week, then we're going to have to move\nmore stuff out.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nYes, and it may just be worth a reminder also that the cells for S and X are actually still 18650, and\nthose are coming from a different production pathway in Japan. Very similar technology. Almost the same\ntechnology.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, but it's similar to the -- yes, the internals are essentially the same for both cars.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nYes, but it's -- yes, but different supply chain, different set of geography.TESLA, INC. FQ2 2017 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 02, 2017\nMartin Viecha\nRedburn (Europe) Limited, Research Division\nAnd then the follow-up question is on the Model Y. I think you just mentioned an hour ago that it's going\nto be made probably on the same platform or very similar platform as a Model 3.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, we're really going to have to\u2026\nMartin Viecha\nRedburn (Europe) Limited, Research Division\nIs it still going to have\u2026\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWe're going to aim for maximum carryover.\nMartin Viecha\nRedburn (Europe) Limited, Research Division\nOkay. I mean, just one thing to clarify. Is it still going to be the 100 meters of cables which you'd touched\nupon last time or actually, that's going to be the next generation of vehicles?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nNo, that's one of the things that we would include. We would aim to switch out the wiring models for\n[indiscernible] the wiring models for a redundant flex circuit that's more in the order of 100 meters or so.\nBut -- and then we'd -- obviously, we'd aim to do that both for the Y, if it's called the Y, and the 3 as well."

        "paragraph19": "Our next question is from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.\nAlexander Eugene Potter\nPiper Jaffray Companies, Research Division\nJust one from me. I was wondering the degree to which Tesla would eventually consider maybe charging\nmore for, I guess, what you would call nontraditional product offerings. Things like software, over-the-\nair updates, but also shared mobility, Supercharging, aftermarket. I know in the past you've talked about\nrunning a lot of those businesses just to break even. But I guess, maybe just wondering the circumstances\nunder which you would consider trying to earn a margin on some of these businesses versus situations\nwhere you'd prefer to just give them away?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, I think the -- we have a major element of that which is the Autopilot. That's a software -- that's\nbasically uploading software to the car. It could -- every car made since October last year is capable of\nautonomy, we believe. And so it's really just a question of uploading the software for autonomy. There will\nbe some other things, I think in the future. But our focus is on the Model 3 ramp and we don't want to get\ntoo distracted. Okay, maybe one more question."

FQ2 2017 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 02, 2017\nJust going back to Autopilot development. Obviously, not talking personal details or anything, but you've\nhad some personnel changes in the quarter. And just wondering if those reflected any kind of change of\nstrategy or scope, or if it was just kind of a personal thing? And I guess just related, are you still hoping to\nbe able to do the autonomous drive, LA to New York, by the end of this year?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, I mean I won't comment too much on like individual personnel changes. Look, Tesla's a 33,000-\nperson company. If you actually look at our executive tenure at Tesla, it's extremely good, it's above\naverage. I think we're at least maybe a year or 2 above average in terms of the executive tenure here.\nEvery now and again, something doesn't work out for one reason or another. In the case of Autopilot,\nit's very centrally about vision and image recognition, neural nets, effectively narrow AI and so that's\nthe focus from a recruiting standpoint. And I think we've really got -- I think we've got the best team in\nthe world by a long shot on that front and we are growing it rapidly with world-class talent. And then the\ncoast-coast drive, autonomous drive by the end of the year, I believe we are still on track for that. It is\ncertainly possible that I may have egg on my face on that front. But if it is not at the end of the year, it'll\nbe very close.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nGreat. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Thank you for, Sharie, for your help, and wish\neverybody a great day. Bye-bye.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nThank you."
