We actually tried a new audio system with a bunch of individual mics. That seems to have malfunctioned, so we went back to standard conference call object. Anyway, just want to confirm, people can hear what I am saying. Okay, great. So first of all, let me say that Friday night was an amazing time for Tesla. It was the -- one of the most important days in the history of the company. It's one we've been striving for, for 14 years. It's the car that we've -- the Model 3 -- hanging with us [ 30 ] production Model 3s was just an incredible milestone in the company's history. We wanted to make a great, affordable electric car, which is the fundamental thing that is missing. We wanted to make that from day one. And if we could only have done it sooner, we would have. And I'm glad that this day has come. What we have ahead of us, of course, is an incredibly difficult production ramp. Nonetheless, I think we've got a great team. And I'm very confident"

        "paragraph": "that we'll be able to reach a production rate of 10,000 vehicles per week towards the end of next year. And we remain, we believe, on track to achieve a 5,000-unit week by the end of this year. So I would simply urge people to not get too caught up in what exactly falls within the exact calendar boundaries of a quarter, one quarter over the next, because when you have an exponentially growing production ramp, slight changes of a few weeks here or there can appear to have dramatic changes, but that is simply because of the arbitrary nature of the -- of when a quarter ends. So -- but what people should absolutely have 0 concern about, 0, is that Tesla will achieve a 10,000-unit production week by the end of next year. So if you can associate where we came from, the Roadster, we were making only 600 units a week, where the nonpowertrain portion of the car was made by Lotus. And we did the powertrain and the final assembly of the car, and then we went from that to 20,000 units a year of the Model S, a far more complex car where we did"

        "paragraph": "the whole thing. And then we -- with Model 3, we were more vertically integrated. I think people should really not have any concerns that we won't reach that outcome from a production rate. We're also very confident about costs. We feel we gained a lot of experience. We certainly aspire to learn from mistakes of the past. And I think we largely have. Deepak will go into some of our margin expectations there. And unlike, say for example, the Model X, where the mistake that we made, I obviously take primary responsibility here, was having far too much advanced technology in version 1 of a product, it's an -- Model X is an incredible car, but it was overreaching for the first generation of a product. But in the case of the Model 3, we've strived hard to simplify and make sure that it has everything that's necessary to be a fantastic car. If you see the reviews, the reviews are -- you really could -- one could not ask for better reviews. And I'll just sort of give you one little anecdote, which was -- which I found quite surprising is that when we were giving test drives"

FQ2 2017 EARNINGS CALL AUG 02, 2017 It should also be noted that one of our big concerns was that Model S, particularly, and Model X demand would suffer with the introduction of the 3. In fact, this has turned out to be the opposite situation. Model S and X demand increased with the release of 3. Jon, would you like to just elaborate on that? There was -- we did express this as a concern, and it was a big concern, but it has turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Jonathan McNeill President of Global Sales & Service Yes, I think that's right. Not only, as Elon said, we expressed it as a concern. We had positive comps both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and in orders in the second quarter. But since then, orders have accelerated in July as we noted in our shareholder"

In fact, I don't know -- I think we mentioned some of this in the earnings letter ,but just some of the key stats on July orders for S and X were... Jonathan McNeill President of Global Sales & Service Yes. July orders were 15% higher than our Q2 average weekly order rate, so we've accelerated off of Q2 into July. And as we noted in the shareholder letter, deliveries grew by 53% compared to the Q2 '16 in a flat luxury vehicle market. So we're gaining share in a flat to market down -- to down market, and the order rate's accelerated. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes.

Of course, we know who knows if this will continue, but all indications are that it will, so that's very exciting. As a side note, we're also making great progress on our internal Autopilot software. It's getting better and better. I'm really, really excited. I test drive the latest development release as soon as it comes out, and I'm like, this is really getting to be something special. Because, yes, it's really -- and I think it's going to accelerate from here. And the talent that we're seeing drawing on the technical side for Autopilot is really world class. I don't think there's -- it's unmatched anywhere, I would say. So let's see then. Model 3 orders are -- net-net orders, there's not that many cancelations, there are about 1,800 a day.

If somebody orders a Model 3 now, it's probably late next year before they get it. We want to give people the car, orders to take maybe a 1- or 2- month wait for an S or an X. And I think the point that we're trying to make that the S is still a superior sedan seems to come through -- and it is true. Things get a little confusing because of the nomenclature of being Model 3, but Model S and X, which is I guess sort of my fault being too quick -- too clever for my own good there, because it was supposed to be the Model E.

So it wouldn't be right when we get to 5,000 because initially when you get to 5,000 a week, there's still a lot of overtime. You're still expediting parts from all around the world.

So you guide to positive cash from operations the back half, presumably on your Model 3 ramp in 4Q. But if it's only a little positive, then I guess you would be close to your targeted cash level. So the question is can you help us size of how positive do you expect the cash from operations to be in the back half?

First of all, actually I should clarify that the number of Superchargers will, in fact, triple between now and the end of next year. And that's -- we're confident that, that will address the Supercharging needs of S, X and 3. So we're trying to stay ahead of it. There are occasional places where -- that are tricky to find a location, like Malibu's really difficult. A few places. But the -- we're staying ahead of that. I think it's going to be good. We should see some immediate relief, impress the next customers on some of the key Supercharger locations. We'll also be experimenting with our first sort of,"

Colin Langan UBS Investment Bank, Research Division And if I could just follow up with a related question... Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer Well, maybe just one other point on that and how this can scale pretty efficiently. We have Superchargers that serve 2 major separate needs. There's long-distance route enabling between cities and then there's also within the cities. And while there are definitely some congestion issues, which we're expanding out of very quickly in the cities, for the most part, the Superchargers that are in between cities have a lot of extra capacity. And we've put those stations in place to serve travel between the cities, but they can absorb a lot more cars. So even if we double"

Do you think that's possible in the future? And is the charge time on the 3 the same as the S? I wasn't sure with some of the release. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder It's about the same. Yes, it's comparable to the high-end S. Like your -- the recharge rate of how many miles per hour you recharge is sort of your function of the battery pack size. So like a 100-kilowatt hour pack -- because charge rate is as a function of percentage of packs. So think of 3 and the high-end S as being similar in charge rates.

And so we did check for the -- to get some precision on this. To be more accurate, there are -- there have been 518,000 gross reservations for 3 and then -- and we have 455,000 net reservations. But those cancellations occurred over the course of more than a year. The net gain over the last -- net gain since Friday, net of cancellations, has been over 1,800 per day. But I just didn't want to leave people with the wrong impression. I think this is like inconsequential because with a small amount of effort, we could easily drive the Model 3 reservation number to something much higher, but there's no point.
