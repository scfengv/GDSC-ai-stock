Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect I think our letter says most of it, but I think we're going to spend extra time on Q&A, try to answer as many questions as possible. I think we should really answer -- so we're going to go as long as there are good questions to answer. The thing I'm most excited about is the rapid increase in output. We got -- just in the last 24 hours at Gigafactory managed to achieve a sustained rate of over 3,000 packs per day -- sorry, per week, and actually reached the peak hour with -- if extrapolated outward would be a rate of around 5,000 cars per week. And obviously, you can't take a peak hour and assume every peak is -- every hour is as good as the peak. But it's -- if you can -- if you're going to achieve it even once in an hour, then with continued refinement of the system and improved operational uptime of the machinery, it means that you can achieve that sustained rate with more refinement. So if we spend essentially a month"

I mean, what's interesting is that, at least in the case of pack production, we were able to do this with minimal CapEx. And I think, in general, our understanding of production is improving dramatically -- exponentially, in fact, and we are seeing ways to achieve improved volume with dramatically less CapEx by simplifying the production line, by really engaging with our associates, no matter how junior, and improving the way that parts are made. It's amazing how everybody's got good ideas. Just need to solicit those ideas and implement them and then making ongoing design improvements so that when we discover that something is not well designed for manufacturing, that we will very quickly change that part design and introduce that into the flow. One of the things we also found is that there are some things that are very well suited to manual operation and some things that are very well suited to automated operation, and the 2 should not be confused. So I should be clear that the vast majority of the Tesla production system"

So we tried to automate the placement and bonding of fluff to the top of the battery pack, which is ridiculous.

So basically I'm feeling really good about the Tesla production of Model 3, and I'm very proud of the work that the team has done. It's been an amazing amount of hard work and sacrifice by some very talented people to achieve this outcome. It's worth noting the -- you see a chart in the Model 3 market share versus competitors in midsized premium sedans.

Or at what point do you think you'd get to sort of 5-day, 2-shift operation? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Well, first of all, I think a 5-day, 2-shift operation is a ridiculous way to operate because that would be a very poor use of CapEx. Nor is it the way that we have operated in -- for most of Tesla. So the module production -- the cell module and battery pack production and powertrain production have always operated on a 24/7 basis. And the exception has been general assembly, which has operated on typically 2 to 3 shifts, so about a 5- to 6-day, 20-hour shift; and paint, which has operated on kind of a 6-day basis.

For the Superchargers, I know you guys are not trying to profit off of Tesla owners with that infrastructure, but would you ever open that up to other automakers and try and generate revenue from that system? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect We've always said that we're -- this is not intended to be a walled garden, and we're happy to support other automakers and let them use our Supercharger stations. They would just need to pay the share of the cost proportionate to their vehicle usage. And they would need to be able to accept our charge rate or at least -- and our connector, at least have an adaptor to our connector. So this is something we're very open to, but so far none of the other car makers have wanted to do this. But it's like not because of opposition from us. This is not a walled garden.

Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Sorry. Can you repeat the question? Galileo Russell I'm just wondering why that isn't a moat because as a long-term investor, I feel like the charging infrastructure you guys have built would take years and millions of dollars for another brand to replicate.

We're maybe every 2 to 3 years. So if our innovation is, let's say, twice that of any given competitor, then it is simply -- this is true of, generally, of companies in any industry. Whichever company has the highest rate of innovation, unless that company is actively killed by its competitors in some way that's nefarious or shoots itself in the foot, it will, at some point, exceed those competitors. Like this is obvious that this would occur with Amazon or Walmart, because Walmart's rate of innovation was negligible and Amazon's was very high. The outcome was obvious a long time ago. Galileo Russell And in terms of the Megacharger, I noticed you guys are going to be selling energy at a fixed price for those truck customers. So I'm wondering what the philosophy is there.

But I think there's a lot of different ways that, that can be solved. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Yes. I mean, for sure, with commercial trucking like a heavy-duty Semi, economics are fundamental to that situation. We're not making decisions based on aesthetics or consumer-related things. We're -- like we made our -- we're trying to make our Semi kind of cool and sexy just because we think that that's a good thing to do, not because it affects the buying decision of our customers in a meaningful way. It doesn't really move the needle. I mean, there was like a laughable lawsuit recently from some company ironically called Nikola. It's like Nikola is suing Tesla. That's hilarious.

And so we have to make sure that the Superchargers or Megachargers, whatever you call them, or the trucks are set up in a way that you'd have very low cost of electricity. Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer I mean, one maybe slightly related point to that, that I think is super exciting about this is the potential to link up renewable energy generation at a very fixed and also very affordable cost to power future trucking fleets. Ultimately, that can give customers an incredibly deterministic cost per mile that will not change with the price of petroleum over decades, which is really, really an interesting proposition for a trucking customer. And that's something that we're pretty excited about. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Yes, exactly. It's really worth emphasizing that.

And fundamentally, it's like what is the cost per mile kilometer of cargo? And that drives the commercial trucking market. You can have the ugliest truck in the world and it still would be victorious. Galileo Russell Yes. And building on that, do you have any thoughts on how the trucking market could change or potentially grow if you guys are actually able to deliver on dramatic cost reduction, especially with things like platooning? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect I think it will take away quite a bit of revenue from railway because the reason rail's heavily competitive is it's effectively just platooning with lots of railcars. And you need only a small crew to operate the train. However, trains don't go everywhere. So you have to like have a truck to deliver things to the train rail spur and then pick"

On Tesla Energy, I assume that you guys are basically supply constrained, not demand constrained on that side of the business. So I'm wondering how you're prioritizing residential versus utility scale. And in particular, how has this successful project in South Australia sort of changed the industry's perception of what batteries can do? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Yes, I think it's had quite a profound effect. The -- there's -- South Australia took a chance on doing the world's biggest battery. That's worked out really well. If you read the articles, it's worked out far beyond their expectations because the battery's able to respond at the millisecond level, far faster than any hydrocarbon plant. And so it's value and good stabilization is much greater actually than even a gas turbine plant, which can normally respond quite fast. So it's"
