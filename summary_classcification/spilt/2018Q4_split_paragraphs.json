Last year was definitely the most challenging year in Tesla history, but also the most successful. Thanks to the incredible work of the Tesla team, Model 3 became the best-selling premium vehicle in the U.S. for 2018. And in fact, when considering battery electric vehicles, Tesla achieved an 80% market share of U.S. sales in the last year. I think this point is perhaps not well appreciated. All other electric vehicles combined were 20% of sales in the U.S. in last year. So I think that's not bad. We also delivered -- also made vehicles last year as we did in all prior years combined, which is a tremendous achievement by the Tesla team. The -- if you track Tesla vehicle production year-over-year, cumulative sales deliveries year-over-year, it is about the cleanest exponential I've ever seen. We've basically almost doubled our fleet every year. Every year, we make as many cars as we did in all prior years. So this is a very unusual thing to see for -- especially for a large complex manufactured object. I"

Musk Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect Okay. And we expect that exponential to continue. So with the deliveries this year being -- even in the face of -- if there's a global recession -- even if there's a global recession, we're expecting deliveries this year to be about 50% higher than last year. And this -- it could be a lot more than that. But even with tough economic times, to receive 50% growth is pretty nutty. Over Q4, we achieved GAAP profitability for the second quarter for the first time in the company history, and we increased our cash on hand by more than $700 million, even after paying debt, ending the year with a total of $3.7 billion of cash. This means we have enough cash to settle our convertible bond that will mature in March.TESLA,"

Operating margins in the fourth quarter are usually lower in the automotive industry, but this was not the case for Tesla. 2019 is going to be an amazing year for Tesla. As I mentioned, we're expecting to increase sales by 50%. Perhaps it could be a lot more than 50%, but I think 50% is a very reasonable number. But that's crazy growth for the automotive industry. I want to note that one of our major priorities this quarter is improving service operations. So really, from my standpoint, when I think about what my priorities are this quarter, it's improving service in North America. That's #1. And I think there are some very exciting initiatives we're going to roll out with regard to that.

So let's see, we've opened 27 new store and service locations, bringing our total locations worldwide to 378. And we increased our Mobile Service fleet to 411 vehicles. The Mobile Service fleet is something we can scale up very rapidly, because we don't need bricks and mortar. We can get more vehicles, hire people and deploy rapidly. It also actually results in higher customer satisfaction, because we can actually send one of our service vans to your work or home and fix the car without you having to bring it into a service center or do any paperwork or anything like that. It's really seamless, invisible, the customers love it.

But the next thing we're going to add is, if your car detects something wrong, like a flat tire or a drive unit failure, that before the car has even come to a halt, there is a tow truck and a service loaner on the way.

It was only about maybe 30% in common with the Model S, whereas Model Y is, I think, 76% or something like that, in common with the Model 3. And we're most likely going to put Model Y production right next to -- in fact, as part of our main Gigafactory in Nevada. So it will just be right there, batteries and powertrains will come out and go straight into the vehicle. So that also reduces our risk of execution and reduces the cost of having to transfer parts from California to Nevada. It's not a for-sure thing, but it's quite likely, and it's our default plan.

And do you continue to see S and X demand of 100,000 annually? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect I mean, my best guess, this is just a guess, my best guess for demand of Model 3 worldwide is something -- in a strong economy, is something on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year. That's my best guess for demand of Model 3 in a strong economy. If the economy goes into a recession, then I think that could be something on the -- 40% less.

We -- we already have full self-driving capability on highway.

So it's really quite profound to have that experience. Then the next part of full self-driving would really be to -- is traffic lights. So it's hard. So stop streets are pretty easy because you can essentially geocode those and it's easier to recognize stop signs. Traffic lights and intersections will be the next really tricky one. And then navigating complex parking lots and like -- so like if you're underground in a mall parking lot with a lot of traffic and pedestrians and it's on multiple levels, that kind of thing is what gets tricky.

And is that sort of the order of magnitude? And where do you see those getting much more aligned, just sort of given the laws of where you think cell and pack costs are going? Elon R."

        "paragraph": "Musk Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect Well, the biggest part to bear in mind is the cost of electricity is quite a bit less than the cost of gasoline, especially in Europe or in California or China, basically almost everywhere except, say, the middle of the United States, the cost of gasoline is very expensive and electricity is far cheaper. The -- so that factors into the cost of ownership pretty significantly. It's on -- sort of on the order of $50 to $100 a month, depending upon how much somebody drives. So that's a very important thing to consider for an electric car versus a gasoline car. The -- that said, in terms of initial cost of acquisition, I think it's probably -- this is just off the top of my head, not a calculated number, probably on the order of 7k, but trending towards 4k or 5k. Just off the top of my head. A.M. Sacconaghi Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division Okay. And as you think about 2019, you talked about sort of scenarios for demand and how you plan to roll out the intermediate range and then ultimately the standard range. What is"

When can we expect it? And can you talk about what percentage of S and X have historically been leased in the U.S.? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect Well, we've been reluctant to introduce the leasing on Model 3 because of how -- of its effect on GAAP financials. So it is worth noting that demand to date is with 0 leasing. So obviously, leasing is a way to improve demand, but it has -- it makes our financials looks worse.

So the first part is, so our Street numbers, like consensus, we've gotten everything wrong for 6 years or 7 years since you went public, and there are about $6 in earnings. Talk to us about that if you can. Number two, Elon, could you talk to us about -- can you talk about -- I hear you cut some workforce at SpaceX and there at Tesla and I feel that you have a worry about global economy. Can you talk to us about how you feel about that with your guidance in order -- in the same order?

Deepak Ahuja Former Chief Financial Officer I mean, we can't really, Ben, talk about consensus and what that means. I think we are -- maybe the better approach is we are providing certain guidance here and you and the other analysts need to reflect that in your modeling. And that's the best indication from the company of our projections. In all fairness, that's the best way I can think of answering your question here. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect Yes, J.B., is there anything you want to say? Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer I mean, I think the letter outlines the predicted growth in the battery storage business, the stationary storage business pretty clearly, and that should be included in the projections as well. So I mean, we're excited about it, but I can't say much more detail. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect I mean, our internal projections for stationary storage are closer to 3 gigawatt hours.
