Sir, you may begin.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nThank you, Chanel, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2016 Q&A Webcast.\nI'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Jason Wheeler and Jon McNeill. Our Q3 results are\nannounced in the update letter at the same link as this webcast.\nAnd during our call today, we will make -- we'll discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking\nstatements. These are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results\ncould differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most\nrecent filings with the SEC.\nWe will start today's call with some brief comments by Elon and Jason, followed by your questions and\nanswers.

        "paragraph3": "And, Elon, I'll pass it over to you.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nAll right, thank you. My comments will be brief because I think it's really what I would have to say is\ncaptured in the earnings letter. But obviously, the main thing is that we're able to have our best quarter\never, achieve full GAAP profitability, and moreover, I think we are headed to have a great fourth quarter as\nwell.\nOne of the criticisms I've seen out there is that perhaps Q3 was late kind of expense in Q4. This is not\ntrue. And we currently believe that Q4 will be profitable, excluding noncash stock-based expenses. I think\nthere's actually a chance that we will be -- there's a chance that we'll be profitable even including noncash\nstock-based expenses. It's just a chance. I would -- it's not a promise but I think we've got a shot at\nactually being profitable even taking stock-based expense, et cetera. But -- so it's very exciting. And I\nthink I'm very proud of the Tesla team for executing so well on Q3 and going into Q4 and beyond.\nSo yes, it's been great, definitely one of the best moments ever in Tesla, I think. Jason?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nCool. Thanks, Elon. Just a couple of points I want to hit on real quickly before we jump into Q&A. One is I\njust want to point out the prudent financial management that we've been able to accomplish over the last\nseveral quarters. An example here is back in 2015, we were spending $400 million a quarter on CapEx.\nWe've averaged about $250 million a quarter in 2016. That will change as Model 3 starts to ramp up in\nQ4, but we are focusing on making sure that every dollar we spend is in its highest and best use.\nFrom a gross margin perspective, if you look at automotive gross margin, and it excludes credit revenue,\nwe had a 140 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter. Lots of different factors there: one,\nobviously, the increase in volume helps on the labor and overhead front; second, our reliability continues\nto get better and better; a big change in Model X, over the last 12 months, as we highlighted in the letter;\nand continued improvements in batteries and drive units across both vehicles. Another source of gross\nmargin improvement is the prior sourcing and the wind-down of our commitments on prototype parts for\nModel X.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2016 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2016\nThird point on financial management. You can see our OpEx is growing sublinear to revenue. The\noperating leverage that we've been talking about through the course of the year is starting to kick in. To\nput some real numbers around that, GAAP revenue was up 81% quarter-over-quarter, 145% year-over-\nyear and yet GAAP OpEx was only up 7% quarter-over-quarter compared to 3% year-over-year.\nThe second thing I want to talk for just a couple of minutes about is what we've done to the capital\nstructure and our sources of liquidity. As you may have read in the letter, we paid down $600 million in\ndebt within the quarter, most notably, $422 million of conversions on our 2018 converts, derisking the\nbalance sheet in the future. In addition to that, we were able to sign a $300 million warehouse line, which\ngives us more leasing capacity at great terms. The terms on that vehicle are less than 2%.\nAlso, we managed to get an 80% increase with our largest North America leasing partner in the quarter,\nand we're also on task to sign up a new leasing partner in Q4.\nSo generally, I'd just like to point out that our access to capital markets and our sources of liquidity is as\nstrong as it's ever been.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, in fact just to highlight one comment of what Jason is saying, our vehicle gross margin increased Q2\nto Q3. One of the other things I've seen out there is that like somehow we achieved these numbers as a\nresult of widespread discounting. That is absolutely false. The discounts -- there were a few discounts that\n-- but they were few and far between, and that has been absolutely shut down to 0. So you can see that\nin the fact that the vehicle profitability increased, even excluding ZEV credits from Q2 to Q3.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nAll right. Chanel, I think we're ready for the first question.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2016 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2016\nQuestion and Answer\n...................................................................................................................................................................."

    {
        "paragraph4": "And our first question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nI mean, it looks like a very strong free cash flow quarter but when I look through the balance sheet, there\nseems to be a pretty large increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities that seems to have helped.\nHow should we think about that going into Q4? Does some of that unwind? Were there any changes to\nhigher terms in the quarter? Or is that just this thing with the ramp in production?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSure, yes. Great questions, Jason. So yes, there was definitely an increase in payables and I think that will\nstart to unwind a little bit in Q4, although this is natural. If you look at production, I believe it increased\n37% quarter-over-quarter so there's naturally going to be more parts coming into the factory. So I think\nsome of that is just in the course of business. And the other thing that I think is worth pointing out on the\ncash flow statement is receivables. We had a lot of deliveries right at the end of the quarter, so we weren't\nable to [indiscernible] all of our receivables. We ended up with a fairly large receivable balance on cars\nthat were delivered in the last 10 days or so.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, definitely. Also yes, with emphasizing that, I mean, it's the first approximation you expect, payables\nto increase by 37% if you -- production does -- and then you have to net out against receivables. And\nwhen you do that, I think it's not really -- not a material situation.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And we are actively looking to increase terms with suppliers. And I think as our production has been\nmore predictable, our suppliers have been much more open to that conversation.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, in fact -- yes, thanks for making that point, Jason. I think it's worth emphasizing that for Model 3, but\nthe Model 3 system is designed -- the whole manufacturing supply chain system is designed so that the\nfaster Model 3 production grows, the faster Tesla's cash balance grows. So the terms that we're getting\nfrom suppliers are significantly better, almost 60 days, as compared to about 40 to 45 days for S and X.\nAnd the Model 3 production and logistics is way faster, so the car spends much less time in the factory\nand we're working on ways to expedite delivery of the vehicles to suit the end customer, which we can\ndo when we have scale. We don't have to just wait for a ship to go somewhere. We can pull up the whole\nship and just have the ship go whenever we want. So the net effect is that instead of growth in a capital\nconsumer, growth is a capital producer. It's quite fundamental.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nGot it. And so the other question I had is you're guiding to profit in Q4 without ZEV credits, and actually,\nit sounds like without even the stock comp possibly, yet production's about flat. Model X is going to get\na little worse. OpEx guidance sort of implies that's up sequentially. So what are the key drivers that are\nactually going to get you to profitability if -- I think, if you take out the ZEV credit, there would have\nprobably been still a loss in this quarter.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2016 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2016\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, we expect gross margin to increase. And, I mean, that's a huge factor. For some points that we\n[indiscernible] before, but like we're using very few prototype parts or growth of the low volume selling\nparts and we're not paying for the craziness of expediting and there are a bunch of design improvements,\ndesign cost down so that actually even a value-neutral to the customer is actually going to cost slightly\nbetter. And we have the P100. So one of the things that the 100-kilowatt hour car, or pack, was only in\nlimited production towards the end of last quarter, and it will be in pretty significant portion of the mix this\nquarter. So yes, yes.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nI think one additional thing is the reliability of the cars continues to get better so our warranty costs are\ndecreasing as well and that's a really -- that's a key driver for us not only from the cost side but from the\ndemand side, where we're referring demand in market, given the reliability of the vehicles.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, I mean, the reliability improvement is massive.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nIt is. So the visits to service for Model X through the course of the year have declined 92%, which is just\na fantastic result both from the manufacturing side, and the vehicle reliability teams have been working\nhard to achieve that and we're going to continue to improve against that.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nAll right. Chanel, let's go to the next question, please."
    },
    {
        "paragraph5": "And our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nJust want to go in a little bit on the regulatory credits. A couple of things. First, clearly with your delivery\nnumbers, the California and the other CARB states are buying more Teslas. Yet last quarter, you talked\nabout the value of those plummeting and we shouldn't really expect much. So kind of, obviously, you're\ngenerating more but a couple of questions. What's happened in the marketplace for those credits? And\nI know even under GAAP, you don't list that as a balance sheet asset, but if we were to think about the\nquarterly generation of credits as well as the credits on your -- in effect in your car bank that could be\nmonetized in the future, how would we think about those?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nUnfortunately, as I said on record before, the CARB, their credit mandate is incredibly weak and needs to\nbe fixed. And when you have a weak mandate, obviously, the value of those credits decline conservatively.\nThere are some quarters where we simply cannot even find a buyer for credit. And then when we can find\na buyer, it's typically $0.50 on the $1 for those who have credit. So -- and then obviously, their creditTESLA, INC. FQ3 2016 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2016\nonly applied to, what, roughly half of our market in the U.S., maybe slightly above half, and it doesn't\napply to Asia or Europe or Canada or Mexico or anywhere else. So it's there. It's -- I think CARB really\nshould be doing more. It's unfortunate that they're not. And then I need to sort of move right along a\nblog piece that's sort of going through this. But that Tesla's sometimes criticized for relying on tax credits\nand that kind of thing. People really misunderstand this. What matters is what does Tesla receive relative\nto its competitors, not what -- that we receive in the absolute. For our competitors, it may be worth\nnoting, maybe you would consider us to be a risk or something that is problematic for us. Our competitors\nmonetize ZEV credits at 100 cents on the dollar. We monetize them at 50 cents on the dollar where we\ncould get it. That means if you have, let's say, -- I mean it depends on the scenario, but if you have, let's\nsay, 3 ZEV credits for an EV that would essentially be worth $5,000 each, so that would be $15,000. So\nwhen, say, Jim or somebody sells an AV, they get $15,000. But when Tesla sells an EV, we get half that.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nRight, they have an internal marketing\u2026\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIt's not me who are being subsidized but our competitors. Now, an interesting thing is there is a limit to\nour disadvantage because of them credit thing is so weak, it only goes so far, it only applies to certain\nstates. So what you will see our competitors do is they will limit their production and they will only sell\ninto those states or almost entirely in those states. That doesn't scale. That will take them to maybe\n40,000 or 50,000 units a year best case but not -- but we're talking about doing 500,000 units a year,\nwhich means at high volume, we no longer suffer the disadvantage of a big credit regime. It's wholly\nmisunderstood.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nThat help, Brian?\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nAnd was there --\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nBetter strength [indiscernible].\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nYes, and just a quick follow-up on GHG credits. Were there any?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSay again, Brian?\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nJust a follow-up. Were there the Z -- GHG or other Cap A credit and how did they compare to prior\nquarters?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderTESLA, INC. FQ3 2016 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2016\nThose are mouse nuts."

    {
        "paragraph6": "And our next question comes from the line from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer.\nColin William Rusch\nOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\nCan we just look at the shipment numbers? So a quarter ago, you were guiding to roughly 80,000\nvehicles. A year and now 3 months later, we're down at 75,000. Can you just walk us through the factors\nthat are impacting that lower shipment number, or delivery number, I should say.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, I think this has really gone over the last quarter's call, is that we had problems getting to rate in the\nfirst half of the year, rate being an average of roughly 2,000 cars a week. Just a lot of things broken in\nour production system. I personally probably took a year off my life or more camping out of the freaking\nfactories solving that along with a number of other members of the Tesla team, went through a bloody\nh*** in first half of this year. We got out of that basically around mid-June and then the result is achieving\na weekly production target of roughly 2,000 cars a week.\nColin William Rusch\nOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Maybe I can take that off-line. So then the second question for me is really about absorption. With\nnearly 40% increase in deliveries, can you guys break out the impact in gross margin to absorption? It\nwould seem that, that would be a meaningful number at this point.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWhat are you talking about?\nColin William Rusch\nOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\nFactory absorption.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nLike, do you mean like fixed cost versus...\nColin William Rusch\nOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\nYes, fixed cost on the factory and how that flows through the depreciation line.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSure. I mean, the way to think about that is I think Elon actually just covered it in his last answer. We had\ncapacitized the factory and had the factory to actually produce much more -- many more cars in the first\nhalf of the year and we fell short of that. And now we're at the rate that we had planned to be at early in\nthe year. So our absorption is about where we'd expect it to be. And I think what you're seeing now from\nan absorption perspective as it's related to gross margin is a good steady state rate.\nColin William Rusch\nOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\nOkay, I was just looking for a quarter-over-quarter number in terms of the contribution margin.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2016 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2016\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nWe typically don't break down all the different factors within gross margin."

    {
        "paragraph7": "And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan.\nRyan J. Brinkman\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nCan you talk about the drivers of the substantially less-than-expected capital expenditures in the quarter\nand the reduction to the full year CapEx guide? Should we think about this as being more about the push-\nout or delay of certain activities that give rise to CapEx? Or is it more that you're on schedule with those\nactivities but doing them in a thriftier way or some sort of combination of these factors?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nOne of the things that what we've found is way better with the 3 program than X and S is that our\nequipment suppliers are willing to work with us on payment terms and we're being able to back-end load.\nAnd in fact, post-production load, a huge amount of the CapEx. So that just stood up a lot better than we\nexpected. But we've not taken any action that would cause the Model 3 time line to be extended in any\nway. We're quite confident of reaching volume production in the second half of next year.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. If I might chime into that a tiny bit as well. We also are continuing to improve the capital efficiency\nper unit of the production lines. And especially over the last few months, we've put a huge amount of\nengineering attention into really focusing on that problem, and we're seeing results. And I think we'll\ncontinue to see incremental improvements all the way from things like the battery cells all the way up to\nthe vehicle itself.\nRyan J. Brinkman\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nOkay. And then the follow-up to that is just in regards to the amended S-4 that you filed a couple of weeks\nback. There was some changed language in there from Tesla's currently planning to raise additional funds\nby the end of the year to you're now stating that you expect adequate liquidity through at least the end of\nthe year, I think it says. So what was the primary change would you say? Does it relate to this CapEx issue\nthat we're talking about here or to higher earnings or to another factor?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, I think it covers all of the above. So we've gotten really good at capital efficiency. And J.B., who\nwas just speaking, has done a great job of that up at the Gigafactory in particular. And I think we're just\nexecuting very well. We met our internal targets for Q3 so -- and you see what happened on the cash flow\nstatement. So I think it's operational execution as well as capital efficiency.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nOne thing that's worth mentioning and certainly, I would take this with a grain of salt and not like it's a\n-- like sometimes I'll say things which I think are sort of speculation or my best guess but they're not --\nit's different from a promise. Our current plan, our current financial plan does not require any capital raise\nfor Model 3 at all. So now that's different from saying whether we should raise capital or not to account\nfor uncertainty, to have a larger buffer and to sort of derisk the business. So -- and then we also feel\npretty good having examined the SolarCity financials that it looks like SolarCity will actually be at leastTESLA, INC. FQ3 2016 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2016\nneutral, but perhaps a cash contributor in the fourth quarter in a small way. But again, let's not take this\nto the bank. It's not a promise. This is like -- this is what appears to be the case. So contingent upon\nshareholder approval, we expect SolarCity to be somewhere between neutral and cash contributor in\nthe fourth quarter. And yes, I mean, things are looking good. Yes. It's not to say that there'll be some\ndarkness ahead but they look really quite good right now. It seems like we probably won't need to capital\nraise even in Q1. I'm not saying we won't, but probably not. And yes, just overall really, things are looking\nquite promising.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And the other thing I would just add on top of that is just go back to some of the comments I made\nat the beginning of the call about our others versus liquidity. I mean the capital markets are up open to\nus and as our asset base grows, our ability to monetize those assets kind of increases. We've got our ABL\nline. We've got the $300 million warehouse line. So we've got the things and we've also been able to line\nup a bunch of incremental capacity on the leasing side during the course of the quarter as well, so that's\ndefinitely a piece of it."

        "paragraph8": "And our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA.\nEmmanuel Rosner\nCLSA Limited, Research Division\nI have a couple of questions on your recent announcement around the autonomous driving. So I guess,\nthe first one is on hardware and then the second one on the software. On hardware, it seems like -- at\nleast from the outside where we're sitting, it seems like just recently, you were indicating you will be\ndeemphasizing the vision approach to aid us in autonomous driving. And now it seems the latest hardware\nseems largely based on vision. So I was curious how -- what was the thought process there? And still\nwithin hardware, how do you acquire confidence that the hardware you're putting in cars today would still\nbe adequate to take you all the way to full autonomy when it's only based -- I mean, largely based on\nvision?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, first of all, I would separate what Tesla says from, say, some supplier of ours issuing bulls***,\nokay. The blog that I wrote was very clear that radar is moving from a supplemental to also a primary\nsensor. It's not to the exclusion of vision but it's also a primary sensor. Vision is still the main thing. But\nradar, instead of merely being like a crosscheck against vision, is really, when done well, and we're very\nconfident at this point that it can be done this way, can be a primary sense as such that you can take\nactions based on radar information alone. You can also take actions based on just vision alone. Much as\na person might take action based on whether you hear something or you see something, you don't need\nto both hear it and see it. Yes, so there's no -- I would feel highly confident that a camera solution with\n12 ultrasonics and a forward radar and the computing power that we now have on board is capable of\nfull autonomy at a -- is significantly greater than even -- there are obviously skeptics out there, well, I\nsuggest that they do not bet against this.\nEmmanuel Rosner\nCLSA Limited, Research Division\nOkay. And then on the software side, I guess a lot of the players involved in developing autonomous\nsolutions seem to think that a big input for autonomous driving, especially higher levels of autonomy,\nsort of a map, a live updated map, what are -- there was not a lot of new information on the most recent\nannouncement on this. What are Tesla's plans for this part of the solution?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ3 2016 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2016\nYou mean...\nElon R.

        "paragraph9": "And our next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nJust a somewhat of a redundant follow-up question here but I really just want to make sure I get this\nright. I mean, as you're looking at R&D and CapEx, I mean those are 2 items that as we're looking at a\nvery significant product launch next year or kind of running at very, very low levels. I'm just curious, as\nyou're talking about this, do you think that -- well that -- I mean, no, they're not that low but I mean\nrelative to what we would expect on a product -- ahead of a product launch, do you think that R&D at\nabsolute levels can stay here and support the Model 3 launch and everything else you're working on or\nwill that need to go up? And then also similarly, I mean, this CapEx number of $1 billion-plus in the fourth\nquarter really is a significant step-up. I mean is that really just too high a number and you guys really are\nrunning significantly lower than this $2.25 billion, lower than $1.8 billion, maybe something significantly\nlower and really finding a massive amount of efficiency here? And I'm just really trying to understand what\nthese levels are going to be because they are very impressive to date.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. I can take the R&D piece. I imagine that R&D will continue to go up.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nBut not like -- not in giant ways.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nNot in giant ways, yes.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nModerate increases in R&D to the extent that they're not some big, sort of, step-change.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Yes, exactly. And on the SG&A side, that's where we're really finding our operating leverage. On the\ncapital front, again, I think there's just continued opportunities for us to optimize this. There's a whole\nnew kind of paradigm of thinking that we're going through. And it's breaking through conventional norms\nsuch as to add a step change in capacity, you have to have -- add a step change in capital. That's not true.\nYou can always optimize things. You can make things move faster. It can be more efficient. You can use\nfloor space better, so I think it's some of this thinking which Elon has talked about a lot about that's really\ngetting baked into our capital plan.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2016 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2016\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. I mean, maybe it seems low relative to the traditional industry, but I guess if we're comparing to\nwhat we've done in our past and even if we just look at the...\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nYes, it looks like a lot of money to us.\nElon R.

So it feels like a huge\namount of money.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nBut I mean you guys really are running at a run rate that is half of what you -- or less than half of what\nyou're originally talking about for the year on a run rate basis. And I'm just trying to understand if that's\nsomething that is more realistic or we should expect a real big step-up in the fourth quarter.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nIf you go back to actually our guidance at the beginning of the year on the OpEx side, I believe our initial\nguidance was 25% year-over-year, and we bumped that up to 30% year-over-year. So there is...\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nI'm sorry, I meant on CapEx.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nOn CapEx, our original guidance at the beginning of the year was $1.5 billion. And then when we made\nthe initial announcement to bring forward production of 500,000 vehicles into 2018, then we bumped it\nup. And I think now we're just getting smarter about that. And that's why we brought that guidance back\ndown in the letter this quarter.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. So we're probably just too conservative on our capital projections. It turned out to be we can do this\nwith less capital than anticipated.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nGot it. And just one follow-up on mix. I mean, these 100 kilowatt-hour models, I mean, it sounds like in\nsome ways, you may have underestimated the high end of the market, which is a good thing. I mean, as\nwe think about that as a percent of mix going forward, I mean, do you really think there's a tremendous\nopportunity for that to be a material part of the mix?\nElon R.

Incorporated, Research Division\nElon, if I could ask a question about SolarCity. One of the things that I cover is SolarCity and you guys\nbought Silevo, my initial reaction was to be negative on it. And one of the things I'm worried about with\nthe transaction if you guys acquired them or merging is the Buffalo deal, I mean it just being a cash cow.\nAnd so I was relieved when I saw Panasonic step in. Can you talk any more about that? And then maybe\nin the same question, how I saw this, the slide deck yesterday about how their business model is changing\nfrom lease to more cash sales or loan sales. What do you expect going forward and maybe that's Jason,\nfrom a cash flow basis? I know you said Q4 relates to that but can this be cash accretive to the business\nnext year? Then I have 1 follow-up.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI think I expect SolarCity to be approximately cash neutral, all things considered next year, yes. It does\ndepend on how fast we ramp up\nproduction in Buffalo. And by the way, I think first in your question, you said \"cash cow.\" I think you\nmaybe meant to say cash back here. But we do it -- no question, that's what I'm saying it is. But the --\nwe do think it's important to have tight control over the production of the solar panels in order to really\n-- in order to have a beautiful solar roof product, we've got to be able to iterate rapidly and have them\nmade exactly the way we want them, so that you have very high-efficiency cells at the lowest cost, that's\nour objective. Just as we've been able to achieve that in partnership with Panasonic on the battery front.\nWe have the best cell at the lowest price. That's a really good place to be. And we are confident we can\nachieve that same outcome in solar. And while also creating a solar roof product that is better than a\nnormal roof, looks better than a normal roof. Now, the market also bifurcated, as I mentioned before.\nThere's like -- if somebody's just installed a roof and if the house is new, it's not going to make sense for\nthem to go reroof the house. It makes more sense to have something that's solar panels are added to the\nroof. But for someone that is building a house or where the roof is nearing its expiry date, then the solarTESLA, INC. FQ3 2016 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2016\nroof is the right option. So the nice thing is you don't really cannibalize one or the -- one from the other.\nThey're 2 separate markets. And so the -- I think we're quite pleasantly surprised by it what we debut on\nFriday. It's exceeded my expectations. And yes, I don't want to jump the gun on that. You should really\nsee what we unveil on Friday. I think it's really great.\nBenjamin Joseph Kallo\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nAnd then one more maybe big picture and probably get made fun of this for asking. But stakeholders,\nI watch what the work you're doing with SpaceX, and you have this statement you said about the\nreason you want to make money is for your work on interplanetary transport. How do you judge a Tesla\nshareholder versus a Tesla car owner? How do you delineate between where you give value versus the\ndifferent stakeholders and the whole group there?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI don't really think about it like that. It's really just, we want to make products that people love and then\nmake enough money out from that to be able to develop new products. And that's it really. It's just --\nthere's like so few products, like how many parts in your body you really love? So rare. And I think to do\nsomething like that, people will buy them, they'll pay a premium for some things they love, of course.\nYes, and then I think it ends up being a good outcome for shareholders, because the whole focus of any\ncompany existing is to make compelling products and services. Some of these people lose sight of why\ncompanies should even exist.\nBenjamin Joseph Kallo\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nLike so, for example, would you scale back the growth of SolarCity, even though it's the greater good for\nthe environment, to be more cash flow positive, I guess, is a good way to look at it.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI don't think -- we have to look at this in the long term. And if SolarCity's moving lots of money, then\nthat's not good for long term, but investors will not support such a situation. So I think there may be\nsome intermediate slowdowns, but this is actually with an eye towards ultimately moving way faster."

Thinking about a fully loaded optimized Model 3, which obviously is smaller\nvehicle, is there a potential to see range? Again, this is not a price-sensitive question, but at the high end\nof the Model 3 side, is there potential to see range extend significantly further than what we're seeing with\nthe S and X?\nJason S.

There's equipment being installed and being commissioned as we speak. There's\na fairly extensive process of bringing that equipment online, starting up pilot production, validating the\npilot production.

As you guys are putting the hardware and\nthe software and learning capabilities in the entire fleet of incremental production, you're going to have\nlots of -- lots and lots of very rich data that is going to be brought to you for analysis and processing\nand learning. And I guess, the question is when, Elon, would you say would be the earliest reasonable\nopportunity for you and perhaps backed by the scientific community and your own community in your\ncompany to make the case, make a strong case to the regulators with the empirical data as you get\nand analyze it at the safety of the vehicles, even if not in a fully autonomous application but even in the\nsemiautonomous so that you can bring more visibility and transparency to the urgent need to address the\nspiraling deaths and injury on our roads?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, well, I should say we do work actually very closely on a daily basis and have for a long time with\nNHTSA and other regulatory agencies around the world, so really at a very detailed level. So -- but they're\ncertainly aware of kind of with nitty-gritty, and as I've said before, it's -- we already see a significant\nimprovement in safety with the semiautonomous features. And what sort of lessons we'll see outside is\nROE, the cases where the Autopilot actually did a lot to mitigate the accident. So that the impact velocity\nwas -- went from being potentially fatal or severe injury to customer stepped out and walked away. There\nare many of those which provides a much more statistically significant sample set then fatalities because\nfatalities are extremely rare. And you need really 1 billion miles or more to try to achieve a statistically\nsignificant conclusion on fatalities. So -- but as our fleet grows, and it's growing rapidly, the number of\nsemiautonomous miles grows, to the point where I think we're now trying to punch 1.5 million, almost 1.5\nmillion miles per day of Autopilot in all kinds of work conditions and weather and -- throughout the world.\nSo -- and the more time that goes by, the more miles we accumulate, the stronger the argument gets\nabout the confidence interval tighten, and it becomes clearer and clearer.

Or what's the thought process there?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI mean you will see a ramp up in Q2 -- in Q1 and Q2, as you would expect, as we get closer to production.\nAnd then a lot of the payments come after our start of productions in Q3, Q4. And there'll be obviously\nextensions on new vehicle development. So you can expect it to ramp up a fair bit over time.

Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nJust want to circle back on a couple of things said earlier. First on the Autopilot, you mentioned that you\nwork very closely with NHTSA. I'm wondering what your take is on the push from the recent document,\nthe federal autonomous vehicles policy (sic) [Federal Automated Vehicles Policy] that really is looking for\ndata sharing among OEMs. I think you're probably clearly in the lead with vehicles on the road and miles\nper day of data that you're aggregating. Wondering what your take is on potentially opening that up and\nsharing with some of your competitors.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWe'd be happy to share information with our competitors that would help improve safety; happy to do so.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nInteresting. Then the second one is really just on the cost side. You think about a traditional OEM and their\nsupplier relationships. There's typically annual price downs, ranging in the 1% to 3% range, sometimes\nmore for more commoditized products, and you're very vertically integrated. I wonder how you think\nabout internal price downs and gaining economies of scale for the Model 3. And what you're really looking\nto achieve from an operational efficiency standpoint on an annual basis with the parts that you have going\ninto your vehicles.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nModel 3 efficiency as a whole, that really is a quantum change in productivity, like really, really crazy.\nI mentioned this before but as we go to high volume, what really matters is the factory, the machine\nthat designs the machine -- or the machine that creates the machine is -- comes actually of greater\nsignificance, much greater significance than the machine itself. That's what we have most of our\nengineering team working on, so a sort of internal codename for the factory machine that builds the\nmachine is the alien dreadnought. So the point at which our factory looks like an alien dreadnought\nthan we know, it's probably right. So we think with Model 3, we'll be alien dreadnought Version 0.5\napproximately.

Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nAnd I'm a little bit hazy on quantifying crazy. Is there any rule of thumb that you can point to with what\nyou're looking to achieve at least in terms of bringing the cost down from a component level from the S to\nthe 3, not even thinking about the X, given the increasing complexity that was involved with the vehicle?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderTESLA, INC. FQ3 2016 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 26, 2016\nWell, it's rough approximation. We think it'll be about half. That's not like everything's half. Some things\nare way less than the half the cost and some things are more than half the cost, but on average, about\nhalf.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nAnd predominantly internally sourced?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, depends on how you consider the value chain, but yes, I guess, arguably, it's majority internally\nsourced. But there's still a huge number of suppliers. The thing that happens when you -- once you start\nmaking almost all major subsystems internally, your supplier count actually grows dramatically; you\nhave far more suppliers, not far fewer. But as a -- but they're at the component level not at the major\nsubsystem level.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, just the one thing I'd add to that too, regardless of what is sourced from the supplier, the way\nto think about our cost and then just goes all the way back to first principles with the value, with\ncommodities in the part, whether they cost reasonably turn those commodities into a usable part with\nreasonable labor overhead, and that's how we think about all material cost decisions, internal or external.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, I mean, the long-term aspiration for the machine that builds the machine, the factory alien\ndreadnought thing, is the long-term aspiration is limited physics.

If I just do some crude\nmath based on your delivery, you've got time line that seems like, at some point in 2018, you'll get there,\nmaybe it's a year or so later if you believe consensus deliveries.

And it varies -- can vary quite a bit by jurisdiction. I\nthink we may see some jurisdictions giving the okay a lot sooner than others.

So if you're at 6 billion miles, you're 100x the -- what the fatality is per mile.
