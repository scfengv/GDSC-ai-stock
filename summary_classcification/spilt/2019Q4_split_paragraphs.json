Deliveries reached over 112,000 vehicles in a single quarter. It's hard to think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can generate more than $20 billion in revenue with 0 advertising spend. I think that's -- where we do say that from time to time, I think it's often overlooked, but to have the highest-demand electric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is, I think, quite remarkable and speaks to the nature of the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate that demand without a bunch of advertising. At our Fremont factory, we're producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in its record year of 2006. And obviously, we expect to exceed that significantly this year. This rate of production was [ cheap ] before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont. So there's a lot of potential to go beyond that number. For the Shanghai factory, I'd like to"

I'm really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory. I think it's going to be an incredible asset to the company. And we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in Shanghai. So a lot of good progress there. Regarding Model Y, it was only 10 months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype. And now in January this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already. Now this is thanks to a great effort from our engineering team. And we managed to achieve, by far, the highest energy efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y all-wheel drive got an EPA rating of 315 miles. This improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today. This is above what we've previously stated by a pretty significant margin. And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it's really just incredible specs all around.TESLA, INC.

And we wanted it to look like something that just kind of came out of a sci-fi movie set from the future. And the demand has been incredible. We've never seen actually such a level of demand at this -- we've never seen anything like it, basically. I think we will make as -- about as many as we can sell for many years.

This past year was truly transformational for Tesla, and I want to thank everyone who's been a part of making this happen. On 2019, a few key points I'd like to highlight. On demand, while we've mentioned this a few times, it's worth highlighting once again.

With respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch of Model 3 in Fremont and Reno. As a result, we've been able to bring new production capacity on board faster and with less cost. This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in Shanghai as well as Model Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched in under one year. Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled through higher volumes, improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management and continued improvement in our product and operational costs.

Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth while managing cash flows to support that growth. On Model Y, we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent quarters. As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model 3. This year, for the Shanghai-built Model 3, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates. In addition, we expect to have completed the majority of planned supply chain localization at the factory or in the region. This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site.

All Rights reserved. spglobal.com/marketintelligence 7Question and Answer Martin Viecha Senior Director for Investor Relations Thank you. We are going to take the first questions from retail investors compiled by Say Technologies. So the first retail investor question is, \"since solar is required for all new home constructions in California, do you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that you can share? What's the 2020 target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?\" Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director Well, I think we do -- we are seeing, mostly from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output for solar -- for the Solarglass Roof."

    {
        "paragraph": "So it's difficult to predict what the demand will be this year, except that the demand is very strong. And we are working also not just through Tesla Solar Roof but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether it's in North America, on the order of 4 million new roofs per year. So we see a lot of interest. And so it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do the installation. But over time, I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something to use Solarglass in one form or another. It's really going to be a choice of do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without. And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and looks good and lasts a long time, and it's the future we want. So it will be a significant product, but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and there's a lot of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome, and this will be a major product line of Tesla.

Zachary Kirkhorn Chief Financial Officer And then on the insurance part of the question, it is our intent to allow people to put their cars into ride- sharing or the FSD network using Tesla Insurance. That's not currently the case, but by the time that this is available, it's our intent to get that ready. Martin Viecha Senior Director for Investor Relations Yes, thank you. Next question from retail investors is, \"how many California owners are currently insured with Tesla Insurance? What's the target for Tesla Insurance in 2020? When will you start to significantly leverage the data you have from the fleet to lower the cost of your coverage? Will we get premium discount of certain percent?\" Elon R.

There's a significant amount of innovation, as we've discussed before in this space, exactly getting to the intent of what the question here is, using our technology to reduce rates.

The amount of money that people spend on car insurance is like a remarkably big percentage of the cost of a car.

And a lot of that insurance cost is just because the insurance companies don't have good information about the drivers. And there's no good way to provide feedback, where it's a very poor feedback mechanism in terms of the insurance rates versus the actual way that the car is being driven, whereas we can do that in real time.

Where are you in retrofitting the FSD computer to older models?\" Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director Well, I mean to be precise, I said I was hoping it would be feature-complete with most FSD by the end of last year. We got pretty close. It's looking like we might be feature-complete in a few months. Feature-complete means just like it has some chance of going from your home to work, let's say, with no interventions. So that's -- it doesn't mean the features are working well, but it means it has above 0 chance. So I think that's looking like maybe it's going to be a couple of months from now. And -- but what isn't obvious regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving is just how much work has been going into improving the foundational elements of autonomy.

Martin Viecha Senior Director for Investor Relations Okay. So now let's switch to institutional shareholder questions. The #1 question is, you have spoken previously about Shanghai Giga being 65% lower CapEx per unit of capacity. Have you learned to do anything better or different from an OpEx perspective? And if yes, what kind of impact might we expect on the long-term gross margin?TESLA, INC.

    },
    {
        "paragraph": "there. We have talked a lot about the CapEx per unit of capacity being lower. But -- and you can basically run down an entire list of COGS between labor cost, material cost due to localization. So it's opening up suppliers that would not have made economic sense from the States. Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well. So we're not shipping cars from California over to China. And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import-related costs. And there's a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in California and also the Model 3 factory in China. And the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty evident from that layout, and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility. And so if you add all of this up, our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model 3 in China relative to Fremont. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that the cost of the Standard Plus that we're selling out of Shanghai is also lower than that"

And so -- and I've said this on previous earnings calls, I think it's fair to expect the margin coming out of the Shanghai facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in Fremont. Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director Yes. I think there's a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially affordable cars than 3 and Y, at least on the continent where the customers are. It kind of makes sense. But what we're doing -- or have been doing in the past was really pretty silly, making cars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe. And this created a lot of cost because you've got to ship those cars. So you've got a lot of finished goods sitting on order or waiting at the port or going through customs. You got tariffs, transport. And then the factory complexity in California is very high because you've got different regulatory requirements in China, North America and Europe.

I think some of our learnings during the Model 3 launch period were we grew too quickly and with too much complexity, and it held back our ability to continue to scale. And part of the journey that we've been on in 2019 is to unwind a series of unintentional bad processes that kind of accumulated in the company over time. And so that's kind of what contributes to the reduction in OpEx over the year as we get smarter about that. And now we've laid a good foundation, I think.

Zachary Kirkhorn Chief Financial Officer [ Just on the right ] metric. Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director Yes, it's a good -- yes. I think there's so much at Tesla where the core technology is improving radically that maybe you wouldn't necessarily notice as an end customer. Or some of them, you'd notice; some of them, you wouldn't. But it's just -- there are these things that have a big effect on the efficiency of the company, like our internal applications team that kind of builds the Tesla internal operating system and improves the sort of core automation of the company. That makes a big difference to our productivity. But you wouldn't necessarily -- you would see it effectively in healthier financials, but you wouldn't necessarily notice it as an end customer.

You mentioned you'll sell as many as you can make. Can you remind me how many you think you can make? And any thoughts on the cost of production for making those Cybertrucks? Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director I think we don't comment on those detailed numbers, except the demand is just far more than we could reasonably make in the space of, I don't know, 3 or 4 years or something like that. So the thing we're going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that's very fundamental because if you don't improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting unit volume from one product to another, and you haven't actually produced more electric vehicles. So that's part of the reason why we have not, for example, really accelerated production of the Tesla Semi because it does use a lot of cells. And unless we've got a lot of battery cells available, then say like accelerated production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making fewer"

This is very fundamental and extremely difficult. So I said we're going to do like kind of Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this and what our plans are. I think probably it's going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter because I think it's going to be kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter. So tentatively, sort of in the April time frame, we'll do a Battery Day and kind of go through what the challenges are, how do you get from here to, I don't know, a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year or something. Charles Eugene Munster Loup Ventures, LLC Great. I look forward to that Battery Day. You also mentioned in your prepared comments about other products that may come up, and the only vehicle not announced for master plan part 2 is a high passenger density vehicle. Any light that you can give us regarding that project?"

Unknown Analyst I want to talk about the differences between the Model 3 and the Model Y beyond the sort of 10% rule of thumb just around cargo and size. Are there other features that are going to differentiate the 2 models? And then as a follow-on to that, you've talked in the past about how Model S sales grew with the introduction of Model X. So are you planning on setting up your production facilities to align with that thesis that essentially Model 3 sales will expand alongside the introduction of Model Y? Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director We're not quite sure what's going to happen, but it is true that Model X -- the introduction of Model X actually increased Model S sales because people would come in and look at the Model X and they like said, \"okay, I prefer the sedan.\" And we're worried that X sales would cause S sales to drop but it actually"

And we'll continue to work on cost reductions in China as we do in Fremont and grow production. Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director Yes. I mean the thing that's really going to, I think, probably just have a profound effect on our financials is like -- is high volume and high margin, obviously. And that high margin part comes from autonomy. So do people buy the Full Self-Driving package or not and do they buy it worldwide or only in certain places? For example, our autonomy is not as good in China as it is in the U.S. So fewer people -- a very small percentage of people buy the FSD package in China. But as we fix that, then we will see a much higher people -- percentage of people buying. And as we are close to Full Self-Driving, that's just going to become more and more compelling.

Can you maybe walk through some of the puts and takes, how you see sort of like that metric\nevolves? Obviously, you have the Model Y, which probably would have initial higher pricing, and then the\nChina Model 3 is at a lower price. So I guess what are the puts and takes for what you see as sort of like\nstable ASP in 2020?\nKunal Girotra\nSenior Director of Energy Operations\nI think the product is better and better. That will increase the value.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. We don't want to really comment on prices and such. I think we'll adjust according to what the\ndemand looks like. I mean, like right now, it's pretty good. Maybe that will change. Who knows? Yes.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nBut I think the way you described it is fair. So I mean relative to the current Model 3, China Model 3\npricing is slightly lower. And our Model Y pricing is public on the website, so you can see that it's clearly\nslightly higher than the Model 3 that's out of Fremont. How the mix of those 3 products, and that's out\nover the course of the year, we'll see. But I think it's probably fair at the moment to assume the mix of\nthose is fairly stable in terms of ASP when you average them together.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. I mean the affordability of our car in China improved radically because of very -- tariffs mostly gone\naway, purchase tax exemption, local product supply, not having to spend a bunch of money to transport it\nover the ocean.
