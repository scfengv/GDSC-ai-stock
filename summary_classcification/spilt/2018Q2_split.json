        "paragraph3": "Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nHi, thank you for joining. First of all, I'd like to say, we're incredibly proud of the Tesla team for producing\n7,000 Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles in the last week of June. Those were amazing efforts. So\nhonored to work with such great team to fuse that incredible result. It's like mind-blowing. We continued\nto achieve 5,000 Model 3s per week, 7,000 combined S, X and 3, multiple weeks in July, showing that\nwe're able to do this on a sustained basis. And we expect to, in the absence of a force majeure or some\nvery unexpected events, be able to achieve an average of 5,000 Model 3s or above for Q3, and 2,000\nModel 3, Model S, X or above per week for Q3 as well. So essentially, 7,000 cars a week, plus for -- on\naverage for Q3. So it's an amazing jump from only a year ago when we're producing 2,000 vehicles a\nweek. It's really kind of a mind-blowing leap forward for a manufacturing company. So yes, it's incredible\nwork by the team to do that. Many, many late nights, weekends, extreme amounts of effort and lots of\nsmart ideas. It's amazing.\nThe results you're seeing is that the Model 3 market share has surpassed all competitor premium, mid-\nsized sedans combined. So Model 3 market share is now a majority. July was a majority of all premium\nsedans. That trend is, we think, likely to continue. So it's not -- we do not think it will stop there. I have\nRobin Ren here, who's our worldwide Head of Sales, to talk about some of the interesting elements that\nwe're seeing in terms of cars that people are trading in, the sales and demand trends. It's looking really,\nreally positive.\nWe're also getting great feedback from Model 3 from our customers, and we're now delivering the\nperformance dual-motor and all-wheel drive versions. And the Model 3 reviews are outstanding, really\ncouldn't ask for better reviews from some of the toughest critics in the world. And it's -- yes, and just the\nthing that we're recognizing is that the more Model 3s we deliver to the field, it's actually causing viral\ngrowth of our sales. So we deliver our Model 3 to somebody, they love it, they tell all their friends, they\nare actually -- really, our customers are our primary sales force. They love their car and take their friends\nfor a drive, and that's the thing that fundamentally drives our sales.TESLA, INC.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5But not everyone has Model 3, obviously, so we need to get the cars out there for test drives. As it is right\nnow, not even all stores in North America have Model 3 for test drives. Of course, we prioritize getting\ncars to customers, but we're soon going to have Model 3s available for test drives in all stores, and both\nthe performance version and the rear-wheel drive version. So a lot of people who will not buy a car until\nthey test drive it, just not unreasonable. Although on Sunday, when I delivered it, testing out like direct\ndelivery, which I think is definitely the future, direct delivery from factory to customer's home or work or\nwherever they are. The guy here who bought it have never actually even sat in a Model 3. I'm like, wow,\nokay, Mr. Raul, how do you feel about the car now? You haven't even driven it. He's like, \"I love it. It's\namazing.\" So yes, it seems to be really well-received.\nYes, so I'd approximate 7,000 cars a week. We believe we can be sustainably profitable from Q3 onwards.\nWe'll try to raise that rate of Model 3 production steadily in the coming quarters and try to get to the\n10,000 cars a week number as soon we can. What we've found, as we spent a lot of time debugging\na wide range manufacturer issues, is that the potential for our existing lines to be able to produce far\nmore cars is much greater than expected. That by simplifying production lines, by speeding them up, by,\nin some cases, having things being done manually instead of automatic, and in other cases having be\ndone automatic instead of manual, we've been able to achieve dramatic improvements to the output of\nexisting lines, which means that our CapEx growing from 5,000 cars a week to 10,000 cars a week is a\ntiny fraction. CapEx going 5,000 to 10,000 is a tiny fraction to CapEx needing to grow from 0 to 5,000\nModel 3s. This is, I think, very good news for capital efficiency of the company. And [indiscernible] that's\ngoing to inform future mass market vehicles that we produce.\nSo -- and from an operating plan standpoint, from Q3 onwards, we're going to emphasize, our goal is\nto be profitable and cash flow positive for every quarter going forward. Now obviously, if there's a big\nrecession or there's a severe force majeure event that interrupts the supply chain, that's not always\npossible. But we're confident that -- and provided the economy is roughly where it is today, reasonably\ngood and there's not a big force majeure event that we -- I feel comfortable achieving the GAAP income\npositive and cash flow positive quarter every quarter from here on out. It's -- I'll just say, there may be\noccasional quarters where we'll pay back a big loan or something where there may be -- just because we\npaid back a big loan. But absent that, we'd be cash flow positive.\nSo once again, I thank the team for their incredible work and our customers for their support. Without\nthe great people we have at Tesla and the customers who put their faith in us by buying our product, we\nwould not be here today. And yes, I've really never been more excited about the future of Tesla. We have\na super exciting set of products to bring out in the future. And yes, I mean, sorry if I sound a little tired,\nI've been working like crazy in the body shop lately. But it's really going great. I'm super excited. Some\ngood people. And a number of the executive team are here. If I could ask the 3 key leaders of the Tesla\nautopilot team to be here. So I'd like to go from here to see if autopilot leaders at Tesla could introduce\nthemselves and say a bit about what you're working on, what you're excited about in the future. Sorry to\nput you guys in the spot. But I think we're making pretty radical advances in the core software technology\nand the vision neural net, and then, very importantly, the Tesla self-driving trip technology that we've\nbeen working on for 3 years is finally coming to fruition. Pete Bannon is going to talk a lot about that. But\nit's a plug-in replacement for the existing computer, and enables an order of magnitude improvements in\noperations per second or frames per second is the way to think about it. And we can go say, they really\nare key to Tesla full vehicle autonomy. And [indiscernible] to be really easy to replace. I'll let Pete talk\nabout that. So we're going to start with like, Stuart, Andrej and then Pete. [indiscernible]\nStuart Bowers\nVice President of Engineering\nOkay. Hi, I'm Stuart.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYou're going to have to talk a lot louder.\nStuart BowersTESLA, INC. FQ2 2018 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 01, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6Vice President of Engineering\nOh, yes, I'll just talk extra loud. So I'm Stuart. Yes, I joined team relatively recently. Incredibly excited\nkind of to see the foundation the team has built up until this point and building on top of that right now.\nSo right now, a lot of the focus is on Autopilot V9, which is our sort of on-ramp to off-ramp solution that's\ngoing to automatically attempt to change lanes, understand what lane the car is in, understand the route\nthe user wants to travel and take that route for the user and ultimately hand back control to that user in\njust kind of safe and controlled.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nIntegrated navigation. So you're like, you have to get to one place, you say like -- you just -- by the way,\na little tip for -- if you're driving Model S or X or 3, is if you just tap and hold -- tap the navigate button\nand just drag down, it will automatically navigate you to your home or work, depending upon where you\nare. That's a pretty cool feature. Yes.\nStuart Bowers\nVice President of Engineering\nSo yes, a lot of focus right now, we're also kind of digging in on some new safety features. I think,\nprobably the thing that's just most exciting for me coming into the team is just seeing the foundations\nbeing built out over the last 2 years. I think, Andrej will talk a lot about some of the perception and vision\nwork we've done there, including data engine. That has sort of allowed us to build on top of that very,\nvery quickly. And I think we're all starting to see a new set of safety features that really only makes sense.\nIn this world, we have extremely high understanding of tapping around the vehicle. So I think, when I\nstart to think about what makes me excited about coming to work, it's like, one, starting to introduce real\naspects of kind of not just making the kind of reducing the drudgery or kind of the risk of commuting, but\nalso really making the element fun. And the second is like dramatically improving safety in a way that you\nreally can only do once you have this like very nuanced understanding of the world around you through\nperception.\nAndrej Karpathy\nDirector of Artificial Intelligence & Autopilot Vision\nHello, everyone. My name is Andrej Karpathy, and I'm the Director of AI here at Tesla. In particular, I lead\nthe vision team, which is responsible for turning the video stream that we receive from all the cameras\nin the vehicle into an understanding of what is around us and around the vehicle. I work with neural\nnetworks for about 10 years, earned my -- mostly as PhD student at Stanford, and as a research scientist\nin OpenAI, And what I'm really excited about is really building up this infrastructure for computer vision\nthat underlies all the neural network training, trying to get those networks to work extremely well and\nmake that really good foundation on top of which we build out all the features of the autopilot, like the\nfeatures associated with the V9 where really that's going to come up and that Stuart has mentioned.\nPeter Bannon\nThis is Pete Bannon. My team...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\n[indiscernible] talk loudly -- yes.\nPeter Bannon\nMy team is leading currently the hardware 3 development. The chips are up and working, and we have\ndrop-in replacements for S, X and 3. All have been driven in the field. They support the current networks\nrunning today in the car at full frame rates, with a lot of idle cycles to spare. So I think we're all really\nexcited about what Andrej and his team will be able to do with this hardware in the future. I think, like\none little anecdotal story was I gave a talk to his team on hardware 3 last month, explaining how itTESLA, INC.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7worked and what it was capable of. And then, afterwards, one of the researchers came up to me, he was\nreally excited and he said, \"this is so exciting.\"\nSo as a hardware designer, having excited software developers is the best. It's a really fun place to work\nbecause I do get to work with my 2 primary customers, Stuart and Andrej, and making them happy is\npretty fun.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nActually, Pete, maybe -- a lot of people know about your background, but not everyone does, so if you can\njust like -- Pete's a super humble guy, but if you could just, yes, talk about the stuff you've done before.\nPeter Bannon\nLet's see, I started working designing computers in Digital Equipment Corporation in 1984, back when\nthey were refrigerator-sized, and have been working on smaller and smaller designs ever since. I was\nan Intel fellow, working on a team for a little while, then I was VP of Architecture and Verification at PA\nSemi, which was acquired by Apple. I led the design of the first ARM 32-bit processor that went into the\niPhone 5. I built the team that designed the first ARM 64-bit processor in the world, which went into the\niPhone 5S. And then, I worked on performance modeling and performance improvements at Apple for 8\nyears. And then, 2 years later, I came to Tesla, and designed the neural network accelerator that's part of\nhardware 3 and helped architect the rest of the hardware 3 solution that will be in the car next year.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, maybe worth articulating some of the details, what the design principles that -- explain why, at Tesla,\nAI chip or AI computer essentially for the car is able to achieve order of magnitude better processing than\nanything else that exists.\nPeter Bannon\nSure. So like 2 years ago, when I joined Tesla, we did a survey of all of the solutions that were out there\nfor running neural networks, including GPUs. We went and talked to other people like at ARM that were\nbuilding embedded solutions for running neural networks, and pretty much everywhere we looked, if\nsomebody had a hammer, whether it was a CPU or a GPU or whatever, they were adding something to\naccelerate neural networks, but nobody was doing a bottoms up design from scratch, which is what we\nelected to do. We had the benefit of having the insight into seeing what Tesla's neural networks looked like\nback then, and having projections to what they would look like into the future and we're able to leverage\nall of that knowledge and are willing to totally commit to that style of computing to produce the design\nthat's dramatically more efficient and has dramatically more performance than what you can buy today.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWell, thanks. Yes, I mean, essentially, the key is to be able to run the neural net at a fundamental -- at\na bare metal level so that you're -- in the circuits, especially when you're the calculations in the circuits\nitself and not in some sort of emulation mode, which is how a GPU or CPU would operate. So you want to\ndo basically a mass amount of localized matrix calculations with the memory right there. So it's a huge\nnumber of very simple complications with the memory needed to straight adjust those complications right\nnext to the circuits that are doing the matrix calculations. And the net effect is an order of magnitude\nimprovement in the frames per second. Our current hardware, which I'm a big fan of NVIDIA, they're\ngreat stuff, but using a GPU, primarily, it's an emulation mode. So -- and you also get choked on the bus.\nSo the transfer between the GPU and the CPU ends up being one that constrains the system. So the net\neffect is we're able to, with the Tesla computer, we've been in like semi-stealth mode basically for the\nlast 2 to 3 years on this, but I think it's probably time to let the cat out of the bag because that -- the\ncat's coming out of the bag anyway. So it's an incredible job by Pete, as seen. It's great, the world's most\nadvanced computer for -- designed specifically for autonomous operation. And as a rough sort of figure ofTESLA, INC.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8merit, whereas the current NVIDIA-based hardware can do 200 frames a second, this is able to do over\n2,000 frames a second, and with full redundancy and fail over. So it's an amazing design and we're looking\nto increase the size of our chip team and our investment in that as quickly as possible.\nI think we're at some of the best days the world, but I think we want to build on it even more. And it's\ngoing to cost the same as our current hardware, and we anticipate that this -- they would actually just\nreplace those replacements, which is why we made it easy to switch out the computer. And that's all\nthat needs to be done. If we take out one computer and plug in the next, that's it. All the connectors are\ncompatible, and an order of magnitude more processing. And you can run all cameras at full frame rate,\nfull resolution with a complex neural net. So it's super kickass. Thank you for doing that.\nPeter Bannon\nYou're welcome.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nThanks for making net and thanks for making the software. And I'd like -- basically, I wanted to introduce\n3 of the key people at Tesla that are doing this. I have huge respect and admiration for you guys. And it's\nbecause of what you and your team is doing that's how we're successful in this arena.\nMartin Viecha\nThank you, Elon. Sherry. Let's go to the first question.TESLA, INC.

        "paragraph5": "Our first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nI have one question and one follow-up, please. First, just on gross margins, it looks like S and X gross\nmargins were up maybe 500 basis points sequentially. And I'm wondering, maybe you can articulate\nwhat drove that? And then, more importantly, it looks like you're calling for Model 3 gross margins to\ngo from about maybe 3% this quarter to 15% next quarter. That's about a $6,000 cost out per car.\nAnd I'm wondering if you can maybe help us understand what sort of the forces that drive that kind of\nimprovement in a relatively short time frame?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, absolutely. First of all, I'd like to apologize for being impolite on the prior call. Honestly, I don't think\nthere is really any excuse for bad manners, I was kind of violating my own rule in that regard. So I have\nsome excuse -- there are reasons for it, I've gotten no sleep and have been working sort of 110-hour,\n120-hour weeks. But nonetheless, still no excuse. My apologies for not being polite on the prior call.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nI appreciate that. Thank you.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nAnd let's see, with respect to gross margin, I'll touch on that and then hand the rest to Deepak. But\ncertainly, when spooling up the production line, there are tremendous amount of inefficiencies. There's\na lot of hurry up and wait where some parts of the production line move well and one part doesn't. And\nwe have associates waiting around with nothing to do. There are parts that we thought were right but\nthen it turns out we've got -- they weren't right and then we send it back to the supplier. It's just like the\nwhole sort of giant machine kind of -- you just need to have to lurch into a high pace. And there's a lot of\nlurching, which is very inefficient. So you end up having super high labor cost per car. And it just needs --\nit takes time to sort of spool up this giant machine. It's a -- basically, a production system is like a giant\ncybernetic collector. And then, it moves as fast as its slowest part. So as we address those slow parts and\nas you improve efficiency, then gap -- grow gross margin, and so the profitability of the car just improves\ndramatically. That's sort of at a high level. Do you want to add to that?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nNo, you described it extremely well. So just to sort of summarize, this was a major milestone for us in Q2\nthat the gross margin in Model 3 turned slightly positive. And we feel really good about the path ahead.\nAnd as Elon said, it's driven predominantly by manufacturing cost efficiencies. It's the labor hours that we\nuse to produce each car becomes less, the initial ramp up costs that we have that are one-time as those\ninefficiencies disappear. Our fixed cost that are there, that gets leveraged to a higher volume. So all of\nthat.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nActually, a thing that can also happen is that if it turns out that, say, a production part was either designed\nwrong or built wrong or something wrong with it, then on a kind of emergency basis, we have to go withTESLA, INC.

But a power producer of a low-volume tooling can\neasily be 10x more than a product produced off of production tooling. And so just wanted -- you can have\n-- and sometimes, it's -- it gets really nutty [indiscernible]. If you got a machine and something happened\nout of a block, and it's either that or make a car, but the cost of using low volume, cost of producing low-\nvolume tooling can be really nutty.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd that journey just continues. As we stabilize and grow production from these levels, we achieve even\nmore efficiencies. And Q3 also benefits with somewhat improved mix as we're going to sell more all-wheel\ndrive and performance cars. And in the long run, as we continue to achieve those efficiencies on cost, our\ngross margins will continue to increase.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. I mean, I don't know if this trend will continue. We're trying to give you essentially all the information\nthat at least we know, but we're seeing roughly half of our customers choose the dual-motor all-wheel\ndrive option, which is actually quite a good positive surprise.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, it's been heartening to see that mix in terms of what customers want. And Robin can probably add\nmore to that.\nRobin Ren\nYes. So starting from end of June, when we opened the configurator and invited the existing reservation\norders, we saw tremendous excitement and response from our customers. As Deepak just mentioned, we\nactually see more orders for the all-wheel drive dual-motor car and performance cars combined than the\nrear-wheel drive cars.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. It's -- we don't want to say this should be assumed to be a continued thing. It's just the thing we are\nseeing now.\nRobin Ren\nCorrect. And another thing I want to point out is that we are absolutely -- since we opened the\nconfigurator to the general public in early July, we are seeing an increased demand coming from people\nwho do not currently hold a reservation. I think that's something that we found super exciting because\nthese are the people who actually had no idea about Model 3 and they heard about Model 3 as available to\norder. Many of them requested test drives. And since early July, we have over 60,000 test drive requests\nin the U.S. alone. And these people come into our stores, do the test drive, and they become super\nexcited and they decide to order a car. So we believe that the strong demand coming from, especially the\nnon-reservation orders, is going to dramatically increase as we increase our test drive population. To give\nyou an example, 3 weeks ago, we had only 8 stores having test drive cars, to Elon's point earlier. Now we\nhave over 90 stores having test drive cars.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nIt's worth mentioning, just an interesting little bits of information that Robin was telling me -- and Robin, I\nwould just congratulate you on doing a great job running worldwide sales [indiscernible] and the also work\ndone in China, which is like really some next-level stuff. Robin was born and raised in China, and has been\n-- along with Tom and Grace as well, the team China has been instrumental in establishing the Tesla ChinaTESLA, INC.

But it's really -- I think -- and some of the things people won't expect, like what are\nthe top 5 trade-in cars for Model 3?\nRobin Ren\nYes, this is very interesting. So we looked at what people who are buying Model 3 cars in the United\nStates, what cars they are trading in. What we found is throughout this year, from January to July, the top\n5 non-Tesla cars people are trading in to get into a Model 3, they are Toyota Prius, BMW 3 Series, Honda\nAccord, Honda Civic and Nissan Leaf.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nReally surprising.\nRobin Ren\nYes, they are surprising because they are not the traditional premium sedans. They are actually -- many of\nthem are mainstream midsized sedans.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nRight. And obviously, at this point, not yet selling at $35,000 a car. So it is promising for the future."

        "paragraph6": "Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.\nJoseph Robert Spak\nRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nMaybe we could tackle some of the commentary about the Gigafactory coming in, in China. When you first\nannounced the Gigafactory 1, I think you said that was going to be about a $5 billion investment. And you\nmentioned some volume numbers associated with what you think you can do in China. So we do some\nextrapolation, looks like maybe 15 gigawatts of -- gigawatt hours of initial capacity. I'm wondering if you\ncould also do a linear extrapolation on the cost you think you need for that factory.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nSure.

I\nhope you accept my apologies.\nJoseph Robert Spak\nRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nThanks.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nSo with respect to Gigafactory, with CapEx, I think, we booked a tremendous amount with Gigafactory 1.\nAnd we're confident that we can do the Gigafactory in China for a lot less. I think it's probably closer to\n-- this is just a guess, but probably closer to $2 billion. And unless we be at a higher -- and that would\nbe sort of the 250,000 vehicle per year rate. And so I think we could be a lot more efficient with CapEx.\nAnd that would include at least battery module and pack production, body shop, paint shop and general\nassembly. [indiscernible] but that's about the right number for that. And sub production is something we\nstill need to figure out with respect to the Shanghai factory.

We found surprising number of ways to improve efficiency and speed and\ndensity as well at Gigafactory 1. And all those lessons will absolutely be shared with Gigafactory 3.\nThe teams are already, of course, beginning to collaborate and start to figure out ways to do this more\nefficiently and with less CapEx than last time. Yes.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, I think we -- like less than half is like would be a good estimate. And maybe a lot less than half, but\nnot more than half would be a fair estimate for CapEx to get to that 250,000 level. So just launched a\ntremendous amount of manufacturing, definitely burned out a lot of neurons [indiscernible] like next level.\nBut on the plus side, we really know a lot about volume manufacturing at this point.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nI mean, there are so many specific examples.

So as you start to add very tactical strategic CapEx to the existing lines,\nthat's how we can get to something close to double or beyond with a really, really small increment.\nElon R.

We -- it was the fun project, actually. So not only was it producing good results, but it was a lot of\npeople contributed from different engineering groups and had a lot of fun in the process.

It's like -- you really -- there's like -- so it's like those are really fast flowing\n[indiscernible]\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nWe just wanted to create an assembly line that would be very easy and very straightforward. So it's a\nstraight line. Very simple. Car enters at one point and it's finished at the other end. Very simple access\non all sides, very simple tooling that we reused for most of -- actually, nearly all of it is systems and tools\nthat we discarded from previous S and X all for Model 3.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nEspecially Model 3. Like it was probably like we got 2 weeks to solve this problem, which is like quasi\nimpossible. So we actually didn't have time to order new equipment because it would have taken too long\nto arrive. So we took the conveyors that we discarded from the GA 3 line, which didn't work. Or it was way\ntoo complex to actually move our products.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd we amplified, repurposed them, make them sturdy for what was needed and...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWell, Like a really cool idea was putting them on the 1% grade. So it's like, technically, the conveyors\nfor parts delivery to GA 3 were not rated to be able to move something as heavy as a car. So we made it\ndownhill and on a 1% downward grade, the car at the top, so then you can actually overcome the...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nGravity helps.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, gravity. So if you basically -- with Newton on your side, you can accomplish a lot.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, it's pushing the car.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nExactly.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nNo. And something that I'm particularly happy about is that we installed the quality team at the end of\nthe line, and we wanted to have at least as high standards on this new likeness and the other one. And\nbecause it is so simple and straightforward, they can run very quickly to any point in the line if there'sTESLA, INC.

And the quality of the cars that come out of this structure is at least as good as --\nand we make all the performance cars on this particular line and they seem to be doing quite well. So this\nis a very pleasant surprise. And the associates seems to be very happy and engaged in that particular\narea. So this may be a model of how we may want to start general assembly for future vehicles, at least\nstart. And we can always add further automation and complexity.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nAnd so what is counterintuitive is that this actually has fully considered fewer labor hours per car than\nlike the GA 3 system. And just to elaborate on what I was saying, when we have parts delivery to GA 4,\nthe truck literally like they just backs up to the side of the line. It was like a door in the tent. And then\nthat's used to unload parts from suppliers directly to where they're needed on the line. So there's no\nintermediate [indiscernible] whereas for GA 3, they unload it, they put it in a warehouse, then they're\nrepackaged for the warehouse into these turrets which just actually -- so we actually have 220 people,\nsomething like that across all shifts, whose only job it was, was to repackage parts from the boxes from\nsuppliers to the boxes that -- to these turrets that go into lifters that go up into GA 3. And especially all\nthey do is move things from one box to another box, and we don't need that at all on GA 4.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAll gone.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nAll gone, yes. And the stress of sort of 24/7 robotics, technicians that are constantly trying to make the\nmachines have uptime, that's very expensive. And so when we think about not having to maintain all\nthese robotic systems, that's a big cost savings as well. And now we're going to gradually be adding\nsimple automation into GA 4 to make it easier to build a car and that are sort of labor saving devices. It's\nfundamental. It's already at an efficiency level greater than GA 3, which is pretty impressive."

The first is for the Autopilot\nteam. There's an argument that a fully autonomous car is essentially like a terminator that is programmed\nto save lives in highly complex terrestrial environments.

And\nif anything, the autonomous cars will be pretty easy to bully because they'll be optimizing so much for\navoiding collision. So that'll be more of a challenge than anything else, is as soon as somebody sees those\ncars are autonomous, they know they can like cut them off and the car's going to be doing what it can to\navoid a collision.

Ferragu\nNew Street Research LLP\n_\nSo I wanted to make sure we understand well how you stop burning cash going forward in coming\nquarters. And my understanding is that an important moving part here probably is -- probably the most\nimportant one, is a positive impact of the ramp of the Model 3 on your working capital. And so I did some\nquick math on the quarter and I see your payables increased by $430 million while your receivable didn't\nmove much, which makes sense because you get paid on the spot and you pay your suppliers only on a\n60-day notice or more. And so if I divide that by the number of incremental cars you've been producing\nin the quarter, I get to about $23,000 per car. And of course, my question is whether this is a good way\nto think about it, which means that going forward, when you move into Q3 and Q4, every additional car,\nevery additional Model 3 you're going to produce, you're going to bump up payables by something in the\nregion of $20,000, and that's going to be the main driver getting you to breakeven and to stop burning\ncash.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, Deepak here. I mean, there are many factors. Clearly, the working capital benefit of the difference\nin the payable terms versus collecting cash is one of them. But also, it's our gross margin improvement\non the business, it's the higher volumes and the higher gross margin resulting in higher gross profit. I'm\nstating the obvious there on Model 3. Our S and X volumes are increasing, too, in the second half. That's\ngoing to help us significantly. And all of our other businesses are improving their profitability while our\nOpEx is staying essentially flat, so massive leverage in the business. So when you combine all of that,\nthat's what is giving us the cash flow from operations to fund our -- the rest of our business and grow\ncash.

Ltd., Research Division\nI guess my question's for the Autopilot team. We've been looking forward to this fully autonomous coast-\nto-coast drive. And, Elon, I think you sort of said on previous calls, if I can paraphrase, that the team's\nbeen focused on developing a full self-driving suite that would work basically on all different kinds of road\nconditions. And I'm just curious, what's holding back that capability today to go coast-to-coast? And are\nwe closer now that you've strengthened the compute technology?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, the -- we can do a coast-to-coast drive especially if we pick a specific route and then write code to\nreally make that route work. We could do a coast-to-coast route drive, but that would be kind of gaming\nthe system, and I think it's really important for the Autopilot team to be focused on fundamental safety of\nthe existing features. So that's -- the focus is really massively on safety of existing features. And there's\na dev -- an advanced dev role that can do things like recognize traffic lights and stop signs and make\nhard right turns and that kind of thing. But it's not the safety level that [makes it okay for release ]. So\nbut -- yes, because it really -- you want many lines of reliability before anything that's released to end\ncustomers. So I don't want to take team off that until so we feel like we've really -- done everything we\ncan for the core functionality. And, Stuart, do you want to add to that?\nStuart Bowers\nVice President of Engineering\nYes. I mean, I think, the big thing I'd say is that, Elon, to reiterate Elon's point, there's no question you\ncan kind of build a demo around the stuff. The challenge right now for the team is just increasing the\nsafety and utility of Autopilot to over a quarter million cars we have today and pushing more out after\nthat. So I think, when we look kind of forward to what the next probably 6 to 12 months look like, it's\ntaking those same kind of features that we've been working on, probably deploying them in the form\nof active safety features. Like that's like a thing we can do already, is to understand like use this rich\nunderstanding in environment to actually try to keep you safer, to either beep or brake. And then also, of\ncourse, like one huge advantage that we have is we can understand what humans actually did in these\nvehicles and test our software to make sure that we would have made decisions that were similar, if not\nsafer. So that's going to be a huge part of what we do over the next probably 2 quarters.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes.

It would\nseem like some of the effects on [ outer margins ] and cash flows could be pretty positive.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, I think it's extremely powerful once people are comfortable using the technology and see just how\nmuch utility it brings.

I mean, over the 2 main\nchallenges of Tesla, but also for the rest of the industry is the manufacturing parts, which has been\novercome by a lot of companies already, with the second one being the technology part.

And manufacturing at volume is\nmostly a software problem. I think that was not well appreciated.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nI think maybe one other lesson learned is that it's obviously not the best approach or best efficiency to\noutsource some of that development. Some of the areas that we struggle the most through the Model 3\nramp were those where we had perhaps less visibility and less control and less direct kind of skin in the\ngame on how those production lines were designed and built.\nElon R.

Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. So that learning curve often involves Tesla coming directly in, understanding the process intimately\nand simplifying it and then essentially doing our own design or changes to the lines that were built. And\nI think that's a key learning point that we've taken. And I think the way that we can do this a lot more\nefficiently in the future is kind of doing that approach from the start.\nElon R.

It's actually lighter,\nbetter, cheaper and we'll be introducing that around the end of this year probably reach volume production\non that in Q1 or something that will -- yes, make that follow up lighter, better and cheaper and achieve\nhigher range. And that line is under construction. It will be -- yes, active in about 6 months.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes, there's -- we did this somewhat the first time around, but now there is, I think, even more exciting\nunderstanding of the value of having those, as Elon said, having the design engineers just working\nintimately with automation and line engineers simplifying the process as they're designing a product.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. And I mean, I -- because we're sort of desperate to try to get the production working, we actually\ntook designers from our A team and had them work in the factory and improve -- work on production\nand it's given them tremendous insight into how they need to change the designs in the future to make it\neasier to produce because you feel the pain directly.\nJeffrey B.

        "paragraph15": "Our next question comes from Zachary Shahan with CleanTechnica.\nZachary Shahan\nFirst of all, thanks for the recent retweet, Elon. I was really, really impressed with the Model 3 after\nowning a Model S, and so I'm really impressed how much you've developed since the early days. My first\nquestion was about conquest sales actually. Right before the call, we published an article that Camry sales\nwere down 22% year-over-year, Prius sales were down 23% year-over-year, and we're very curious how\nmuch you're pulling from these other cars, other segments. It sounds like you've sort of answered that\nquestion at the beginning, but can you give anything in terms of what percentage those top 5 are in terms\nof trade-in sales and how broad you're pulling? I know you pull from pickup trucks, from sports cars. Can\nyou speak a little more about the diversity you're pulling from?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nActually we don't -- actually what we have right now is just the top 5. I'm not sure what the allocation\nis between top 5 or where it goes beyond top 5. We're just sort of [indiscernible] ask for the top 5\nbreakdown. And it's just interesting that a few are trading up into a Tesla, so they're willing to spend\nmore money on a Tesla than their current car just based on the trade-in values. I mean, a Civic is a very\ninexpensive car compared to a -- particularly the Model 3 today. So that's promising from a market access\nstandpoint. But of course, we're going to do the Model Y and compact SUV. We're going to do pickup truck,\nthe Semi, the next-generation Roadster. I mean, we have such awesome ideas and probably the biggest\nlimiter on our growth is like how fast can we grow battery production and especially cell production on the\nwholesale supply chain, I think will be the fundamental determinant of Tesla's growth. We're super fired\nup to the [indiscernible]. Like I think they're all super cool. I know [indiscernible] favorite is the Semi,\nand that's pretty wicked obviously and -- it's pretty -- it's great. And we are ramping -- we've actually\nfared, we made significant improvements in the designs since the unveiling that we had and so really even\nbetter than what we talked about. The -- probably my personal favorite for the next product is pickup\ntruck and we're just doing an amazing pickup truck. And the Model Y compact SUV, probably the most\npopular car category in the world, obviously going to sell pretty well. So a lot of cool things. And of course,TESLA, INC. FQ2 2018 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 01, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 26solar energy getting the -- we're kind of self-starved for power right now. So we actually had to artificially\nlift the number of Powerwalls because we don't have enough cells. So we're solving for that very rapidly,\nand we expect to ramp up Powerwall and Powerpack production substantially later this year and early\nnext. And as well as getting [indiscernible] -- as well as ramping up of the solar and then the Solar Roof.\nWe now have several hundred homes with Solar Roof on them, and that's going well. It takes a while to\njust confirm that Solar Roof is going to last for 30 years and all the details work out and working with first\nresponders to make sure it's safe in the event of a fire and that kind of thing. So it's quite a long validation\nprogram for a roof which has got to last for 30, 40, 50 years. But that we also expect to ramp that up\nnext year at Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo. That's going to be super exciting. So [indiscernible] I think we're\n[indiscernible] if there's a company with a better product roadmap. I'd like to know what it is because like\nthis is what -- we got some super awesome stuff coming. Yes.\nZachary Shahan\nAnd regarding the Model Y, there's been a lot of questioning if you're going to have the same process as\nwith Model 3 with reservations, if you can shorten the reservation timeline or if you're going to have a\ndifferent process this time around.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWe haven't made a final decision on that.\nZachary Shahan\nSo last question, then. Regarding the daily production, we've been seeing a sort of a rise and fall with the\ndaily production of the Model 3 as you incorporate new performance or white seats. Can you speak at all\n-- we always like to get the technical side of what you're doing there. Can you tell what the bottlenecks\nare right now that you're working through? And what we can sort of -- how we can picture ourselves in the\nfactory there with you?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nAll right. And the thing -- actually what I love about your writing is that you really care about getting the\ndetails right and you really understand things well, which is awesome. And -- but after what -- be careful\nI don't have soundbite that is then for those that don't have a nuanced appreciation of the situation, that\nsoundbite then gets -- becomes front-page news. That's like, nope, that's not what I meant. Exactly. And\nlike, oh, man. this is like [indiscernible] But the -- right now, the biggest constraint on production again,\ndo not -- please don't make federal case out of this because it's something that will be solved in like in\na matter of like a week or 2. It's like it's body production, so that's why -- I mean, you can certainly tell\nwhat am I personally working on that's going to be a bottleneck in the company. So most likely producing\nModel 3 bodies. We made huge progress in the last few weeks and, in fact, I was just told that we're able\nto achieve our first 24-hour period where we made over 800 Model 3 bodies, which is pretty great. And so\nthat sets us -- so we just make sure again that we sustain that 800-plus per day rate. And then paint is\ndoing great. GA's doing great. Yes, it's good.\nZachary Shahan\nA quick request. Years ago, you warned about a coming short tsunami and it seemed obvious that it was\ncoming, but the shorts didn't really seem to recognize it and then sort of attacked you, trolled you for\nmonths. And then finally, it came. You again warned very honestly, I think, very directly that there is going\nto be a short -- kind of epic short squeeze. We have, I think, the whole community has a little request.\nDon't let the trolls get you down. Don't feed the trolls too much, but we do like it when you tease the trolls\na bit. So use your judgment, but thanks a lot for what you're doing.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nRight. Well, thank you for your in depth coverage of clean air energy technology.TESLA, INC.

Really proud to be a Tesla shareholder with the Model 3 ramping to 5,000\na week. And I think you may have touched on this, but I'm curious, will Tesla ever produce vehicles at\nGigafactory 1, maybe the Semi? And then I'm curious on any manufacturing synergies between the Semi\nand the Model 3.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nOh interesting questions. You always ask us really, really interesting questions. Really, really interesting\nquestions that I cannot actually -- the first one, I cannot -- it gets so much attention where we put\nproduction, so I cannot answer any like where we're going to put production questions. The -- but will the\nSemi use a bunch of Model 3 technology, the answer is yes. Jerome, I don't know if you want to elaborate\non that or...\nJerome Guillen\nVice President of Programs\nWell, I mean, you can already see in the prototype that we've had virtually out of the Model 3 component,\nthe screen, the door handles, I mean, as much as possible -- yes, the motors, yes, and the prototype a lot\nof the cell technology. But there are some changes and I'd rather not say it in public, yes. Obviously, it's\ngoing to be better than what we showed last year, a lot of improvements. Yes.\nGalileo Russell\nOkay. So hopefully, you can talk more about this. With the battery project with PG&E that was recently\nannounced, I'm wondering if you can elaborate how you're prioritizing battery pack between auto and\nenergy storage. Because it seems like you ramped auto battery packs to 20 gigawatt hours in the past\n12 months, but are only guiding for about 1 gigawatt hour of Tesla energy installation in the next year.\nSo I'm wondering why is Tesla Energy, given its supply constraints, like why not ramp that supply to 10\ngigawatts? It seems like the guidance is still below there.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. It's -- as Elon suggested earlier, we are -- essentially, it makes sense for us to prioritize Model 3.\nBut we are adding a ton of capacity, self-capacity, and J.B. could talk more about it, that will enable us to\ndramatically ramp our energy storage business as well in the coming quarters.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. You kind of mentioned only 1 gigawatt hour, but that's a big number in that business, and it's maybe\non the order of 300% what we did the prior year. And we're still aiming at maybe another 3, 3x to 4x\ngrowth for 2019.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nSo we're at scale. These are insane growth levels.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nCrazy growth rate.\nElon R. MuskTESLA, INC.

This is like you actually need to build those -- like a lot of atoms but\n[indiscernible] you know what I mean? Like once you build software, you can obviously have lots of\ncopies, but there's like a lot of really complicated atoms, man.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nMaybe specifically also to your cell -- to the cell limitation question, I think this has been mentioned\nbefore, but we also do use some other vendors.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWe use Panasonic and LG and...\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nExactly, our energy products. So I heard people feel like this is kind of a zero-sum game or something\nwith Model 3, but that is not the case.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWe do a partial-sum game [indiscernible] we did shut down this Powerwall cell line for Model 3, to be\ntotally honest, but we kind of have to do that. But that's -- we're adding new cell lines, and we'll be able\nto address that issue very soon.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nI think one perspective we are seeing tripling [indiscernible] also...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nSo these are mad growth numbers, mad.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nLast year, and it's one thing to produce, but it's also another thing to install [indiscernible] you need the\ninfrastructure and the people to do that. So this massive scaling is very few companies grow at that rate.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. And one of the great challenges [indiscernible] there need to be a lot more electricians. So we\nactually had an electrician training program. We're going to actually have to fast-train new people who've\nnever been electricians before to be electricians because otherwise, [indiscernible] there's not enough\nelectrician capacity in the United States and most places in the world to install Powerwalls. And so we'd\nhave to actually literally train electricians and like it takes like 2 years basically before somebody is\ncertified to be an electrician. So it sounds like, okay, we [ obviously ] can't grow faster than the rates and\nnumber of electricians who can physically install Powerwalls. That's like one of the limitations.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nAnd that PG&E project you mentioned is an incredibly exciting one. It kind of is indicative of the growth\nrate. It has [indiscernible]TESLA, INC.

Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nSaying [indiscernible]\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nBut I mean, it is over [indiscernible] gigawatt hour, full considered.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, gigawatt hour. that's public, right?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nIt is now. And it has a -- and just to give you a sense, it took us 5 years of growing that business to get to\na gigawatt hour cumulative deployed.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nAnd so many people who had said gigawatt hour is an impossible number for lithium-ion. Like that's --\nyes.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nThe car business is still much bigger as we sit here today, but the growth rate on energy is faster.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, if you extrapolate energy growth rate -- well, obviously if you extrapolate anything; triple for a year,\npretty soon becomes size of your universe. But long term, we would expect the energy business to catch\nup to the order of business in size.\nGalileo Russell\nAnd then lastly, I'm really curious. Elon, do you have any part of the business that shareholders should be\nasking or thinking more about? Or what do you wish would have been asked on the call?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nGood question. We're trying to anticipate -- actually we're trying to anticipate the questions that are on\npeople's minds, that's why I have the Autopilot, key leaders of the Autopilot team here and much of the\nexecutive team of Tesla here, to try to be proactive in that regard. Was there anything [indiscernible] I\nthink we really covered a lot. So there is any -- yes.\nGalileo Russell\nJust my very last thing, the new fiscal engineering strategy of profit and cash flow and you saying that\nwill last in perpetuity sort of, sort of caught me by surprise personally. And so I'm curious if there's any\ntradeoff to growth with that new strategy? Or sort of what's the rationale behind the scenes. Because this\njust seems like the biggest change in Tesla's financial engineering strategy since the IPO.TESLA, INC.

Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, I mean, being cash flow positive and capital positive doesn't mean we're rolling in money. Like there's\ndefinitely going to be cases where we're just barely cash flow positive or barely profitable in some quarters\nin the future. But I think we're -- and it's been a long time now, it's almost 15 years now. I think we're\nat a scale where the amount of time that it takes to actually scale up and do things is, there's a certain\nminimum -- like we're big enough where we actually can spend money efficiently to make things go faster.\nSo we kind of hit scale with volume production of cars. And I think we can -- I think this is probably the\nright thing to do, is to be sort of essentially self-funding on a go-forward basis. And apart from selective\nsituations where there's some debt, temporary debt for construction of a Gigafactory in China or Europe\nor something like that, but apart from that, I think we -- like essentially, I don't think we're constraining\ngrowth in any significant way by adopting the strategy at this point. It would have been true in times past,\nbut I think it is not the case. Yes.\nMartin Viecha\nOkay. I think that's all [indiscernible]. Thank you very much.
