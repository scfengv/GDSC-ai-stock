So let's see. Actually, we're doing this call from the Gigafactory because that's where the production constraint is for Model 3, from the most important thing for the company. And I always move my desk to wherever -- well, it's not like we have a desk, actually. I move myself to wherever the biggest problem is in Tesla. Somewhat, I really believe that one should lead from the front lines, and that's why I'm here, and I'll go into some of the Gigafactory issues later in the call, but I'd like to start off by acknowledging some, I think, pretty amazing milestones for Tesla. One thing that I thought was really profound was that we surpassed cumulative deliveries of vehicles. We surpassed 0.25 million cumulative deliveries since the company's inception and had record Model S and X net orders and deliveries last quarter. So things are really, I think, going quite well. To put that into perspective, 5 years ago, we had only delivered 2,500"

I would expect, 5 years from now, to be at least an order of magnitude, we're beyond where we are right now and possibly even closer towards magnitude. But for the skeptics out there, I'd like to say -- ask them, which one of you predicted that Tesla would go from 2,500 units delivered to 250,000 units delivered now? I suspect the answer is 0, right? So consider your assumptions for the future on whether they're valid or perhaps pessimistic. So for Model 3, we continue to make significant progress each week. We see no primary problems with our supply chain or any of our production processes. Obviously, there are bottlenecks, there are thousands of processes in creating the Model 3, and we will move as fast as the slowest and least likely process among those thousands. In fact, there's 10,000 unique parts. Or I could just say, of the tens of thousands of processes necessary to produce the car, we will move as fast as the least competent and least likely elements of that mixture. So while the vast majority are going"

FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL NOV 01, 2017 probably sometime in March. This -- I think, in the vast scheme of things, this is a relatively small shift. The Model 3 is a 10-year program, and so we're talking about a few months out of a 10-year program that's, in the grand scheme of things, as certainly if one is doing net present value calculations, this is immaterial. The -- and we have a clear path to that. We understand the bottlenecks. It's difficult to fully understand these things as we actually try to do them. And it's worth noting that some of our manufacturing areas, we're actually seeing capabilities that are, we estimate, in the 6,000 to 7,000 unit per week capability, well in excess of the 5,000-unit capability. So -- and we're optimistic with further"

It's the amount or how much can be done by just beating up robots, shortening the path, intensifying factory, adding additional robots for choke points and just making lines go really, really fast. Speed is the ultimate weapon. And our -- the design of Tesla Model 3 being that it was designed for manufacturability is turning up to be accurate. It's far easier to build this car than a Model E -- than a Model S and vastly easier than a Model X. The primary production constraints really by far is in battery module assembly. So this is -- so I'll just do a little bit of a deep dive on that. There are 4 zones to module manufacturing. So it goes through 4 major production zones. The zones 3 and 4 are in good shape; zones 1 and 2 are not. Zone 2 in particular, this is -- we had a subcontractor -- a systems integration subcontractor that unfortunately really dropped the ball, and"

We had to rewrite all of the software from scratch and redo many of the mechanical and electrical elements of zone 2 of module production. We've managed to rewrite what was about 20 to 30 man years of software in 4 weeks, but there's still a long way to go. It's -- because the software work can be fast with the electromechanical elements that need to be fabricated and installed, and that -- getting these items in place and rebuilt is, unfortunately, a lot longer, and that's -- it's probably more external constraints than software. This is what I spent many a late night on the Gigafactory working on. J.B. has been here constantly, and we've -- we allocated many of our best engineers to fundamentally fixing zone 2 of the module line and then most problem behind that it is zone 1. On the plus side, we now have a very detailed understanding of what is necessary to fix zone 1 and zone 2. We also have a new design for zone"

So we're very confident about the future path of having incredibly efficient production of modules and that this will not be a constraint in the future, but unfortunately, it just takes some amount of time. This is like moving like lightning compared to the -- while there's no one in the automotive industry, there's still some finer amount of time necessary to fix something that we thought was in good shape.

These are really ridiculous. And like anyone -- any journalist who'd written articles in this effect should be ashamed of themselves for lacking journalistic integrity. At every company in the world, there's annual performance reviews. In our annual performance review, despite Tesla having an extremely high standard, and a standard far higher than other car companies, which we need to have in order to survive against much larger car companies, you can't be a little guy and have equal levels of skill as the big guy. If you have 2 boxes of equal votes and one's much smaller, the big guy's going to crush the little guy, obviously. So little guy better have a heck of a lot more skill.

How does this change the trajectory -- or does it change the trajectory from a margin perspective on the Model 3? And then maybe as an aside, can you tell us where you are today on a production-per-week basis and where you expect to be by the end of 2017, just so we can get an idea of the ramp? Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder I don't really like the week-by-week stuff. But the thing -- the reason it's tricky is because people just read too much into it. The ramp curve is a step exponential. So it means like as you alleviate a constraint, the production jumps -- suddenly jumps at a much higher number. And then so although it looks a little staggered, if you sort of zoom out, that production ramp is an exponential with giant week-over-week increases.

Could you just give us a sense, though, about the difference of manufacturing the volume of the 3 compared to -- you -- basically 10x the volume that you're trying to get to in the near term? Then I have a follow-up. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes. There's vastly more automation with Model 3. Now the tricky thing is that when one front of this -- of that automation doesn't work, it's way harder to make up for it with manual labor.

John Douglas Field Senior Vice President of Engineering Sure. The number of actual, what we call a pitch, which is a station for a robot to work on the car in general assembly, is about 1/4 of the typical industry average for number of stations it uses to build a car.

Jon you want to answer? Jonathan McNeill President of Global Sales & Service Yes, it's Jon. I can address a piece of this. So a large chunk of it was discontinued trims. We've introduced the 100-kilowatt battery pack, which has a 335-mile range in Model S. And as a result of that, we discontinued the 90-kilowatt pack. And as those cars were in inventory, we reduced price to move them out. And so that was a piece of the gross margin headwind that won't repeat in -- as we go forward.

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Brian Johnson of Barclays. Brian Arthur Johnson Barclays PLC, Research Division Yes, wanted to just drill down on the service revenue and expenses line. Not something we often talk about, but a lot of the other questions have been asked. Looks like year-over-year revenues were up $180 million, costs were up $247 million. Could you just talk about the drivers of that change between what's left of the drivetrain outsource business, the CPO business, the service loaner actual vehicles expense and then the cost of the PP&E for the actual people and service infrastructure? Jonathan McNeill President of Global Sales & Service Yes. So I think what you see there is the increase in PP&E for the service infrastructure. We wanted to get out in front of demand as we're increasing both S and X fleet size and also of Model 3. So we opened a location just about every 4 days in Q3. And to get ahead of that demand, you probably saw that we put 180 mobile vehicles on the road, and we plan to double that this quarter. And so a lot of that, whatTESLA, INC.

Joseph Robert Spak RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division You also mentioned some constraints in body shop welding and final assembly. And final assembly obviously makes sense, given constraints elsewhere. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about welding. And then as you get to your year-end run rate, is there still going to be a discrepancy between sort of different parts of the entire line? Or do you think everything is going to be roughly at the same level? Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer Doug, would you like to take that on? John Douglas Field Senior Vice President of Engineering Well, with respect to welding, the rate is controlled by -- are you specifically asking about the video? Or do you have another... Joseph Robert Spak RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division I'm sorry. In the letter, it said body shop welding is listed as a constraint. John Douglas FieldTESLA, INC.

        "paragraph": "Senior Vice President of Engineering It's not the same level of constraint as the Gigafactory, but it is one of the more complex parts of the overall assembly line. So to reach our overall production goals, that has to ramp significantly. But again, it's not at the same level of constraint as modules. And it's really driven just by the sheer number of robots in the body shop. It's the highest concentration of robots anywhere in our overall production line. But it is coming up well. The bodies that we're building are of excellent quality. We've had fantastic crash results in testing them. And we're building more and more every day. We're ahead of the rest of the production curve. Joseph Robert Spak RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Okay. And then as a follow-up on the capital question, I mean, Elon, I think, a year ago on this call, you said to go from 5,000 to 10,000 was -- would require a fair amount of capital, but you were confident that it'd be less than you're going 0 to 5,000. And now that you have some real-world experience with the ramp, I'm wondering if you have any different views"

Inc., Research Division Could you talk about the percentage of sales that are coming from these loaners to the fleet vehicles? We're trying to reconcile the MSRP declines that you implemented and what, it looks like, is a little bit more severe ASP decline. And then also, if you could talk a little bit about why you felt that it was necessary to add value to the Model S and Model X while lowering price. It seems like you should be able to drive volumes with one or the other.

I recognize it's not the biggest focus right now, but I'm just curious on solar declining as you expected, but just wondering when you think that can start growing again. Is that a function of Solar Roof? Or is that sort of moving past your sales changes? And then, I guess, similarly on energy storage, the ramp looking -- sort of exiting this year into 2018, is that constrained by the Model 3? Or is that on its own separate track?TESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL NOV 01, 2017 Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes, we are -- we do expect the solar demand to rebound as we move solar sales into all of our stores, which is a much more efficient channel for demand generation. And that's just what's sort of conventional solar. The Solar Roof stuff, we expect, is going to be at -- or well, we're confident it's going to have extremely high demand.

But they -- so they look really good but a roof is expected to last a long time. So at least 25, 30 years. And so there's some rate at which we can do accelerated life testing on -- for the rest of the component. So we can maybe try to accelerate life testing on a 30-year roof in sort of 6 months, but it's hard to do it in less than about that 6 months. So and then we're going to pack that into the production process. So I have no doubt that this will be a very significant part of the business down the road, it just takes a little while to get this behemoth rolling. But once it gets rolling, it's going to be a behemoth. Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer And we continue to install pilot engineering, early customer homes.
