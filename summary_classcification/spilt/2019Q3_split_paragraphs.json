Please go ahead.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you, Sherrine. And good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2019 Q&A Webcast.\nI'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were\nannounced at about 2 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.\nDuring this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These\ncomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ\nmaterially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings\nwith the SEC. ["

First of all, I'd like to just thank the Tesla team for an incredible job this quarter. The execution was outstanding and on just about every front. So it's just an honor to work with such a great team. Q4 -- Q3 was obviously a very strong quarter. And we had record deliveries. We're able to make great strides in controlling our costs. We shifted back to GAAP profitability while also generating strong free cash flow. And again, this would not be possible without each employee doing their part to reduce cost. Our operating cost is now at the lowest level since Model 3 production started. Regarding Gigafactory Shanghai, this month, we started trial production at Giga Shanghai in both vehicles from body to paint to general assembly. So this is a -- I want to emphasize, this is a real factory with a tremendous amount of equipment in it. While a lot of people see the outside shell of the factory, which is enormous and it was essentially underwater in January, it was just below the water table"

        "paragraph": "literally, what is, I think, much more significant is that we're able to install massive stamping machines, a fully operational paint shop and a sophisticated general assembly line in the same period of time in parallel with building the building. I'd like to thank our entire team for this extraordinary achievement. I'm not aware of any factory of this magnitude in history being constructed in such a short period of time, approximately 10 months. As far as I know, this is unprecedented. And Gigafactory Shanghai will become a template for future growth. We're planning to build Model Ys in Shanghai as well, of course, and build a Gigafactory in Europe. And we hope to announce the location of that Gigafactory -- in fact, we will announce the location of that Gigafactory before the end of this year. Regarding Model Y, we're also ahead of schedule on Model Y preparations in Fremont. And we've moved the launch time line from fall 2020 to summer 2020. There may be some room for improvement there, but we're confident about summer 2020. I've actually recently driven the Model Y Release Candidate, and I think it's going to an amazing product and be very well"

Most importantly, it includes the first version of Smart Summon, which has now been used 1 million times. So it's now over 1 million users of Smart Summon. And we're -- in the next week or so, we will be releasing an improved version of Smart Summon, taking into account all the data from those 1 million Smart Summon attempts. So this really illustrates the value of having a massive fleet because it allows us to collect these corner cases and learn from them and use fleet learning and become rapidly better, just as Navigate on Autopilot did on the freeway.

So it's not for sure, but it appears to be on track for at least the early access release of a fully functional Full Self-Driving by the end of this year. And yes, lastly, we're highly focused on decisions that really make a material difference to the company such as opening Gigafactories in other continents. Yes, it's worth noting that these -- ultimately, having 3 Gigafactories, effectively, we'll actually triple our output. And then when you consider increased output per Gigafactory, it's going to actually more than triple our output over time. And then there are a lot of interesting things happening with respect to advanced batteries and more efficient powertrains and Full Self-Driving, all that sort of stuff. But that will be something for a future time. And then one last item is that tomorrow afternoon, we will be releasing version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof. That's the integrated solar"

And I think this product is going to be incredible. But we'll talk more about that on the official product launch, which will be tomorrow afternoon. Martin Viecha Senior Director for Investor Relations Thank you very much. And I think Zachary has some remarks as well. Zachary Kirkhorn Chief Financial Officer Yes. Thank you, Elon. Thank you, Martin. Q3 was a great quarter for Tesla. I know many employees are listening right now, and I want to thank you for your passion and your hard work. We've made terrific progress, and yet again, we realized margin improvement in nearly every aspect of the business. There are 3 key points I'd like to highlight. First, we returned to profitability in Q3, aided by improved gross profit, reduced operating expenses in the absence of negative onetime items that weighed on our financials in the first"

        "paragraph": "half of the year. GAAP automotive gross margin improved sequentially to 22.8% and over 20% excluding regulatory credits. We achieved these improvements through higher production volumes on S/X and Model 3, enabling better fixed cost absorption. We realized improvements in labor hours per vehicle as well as other costs such as warehousing, logistics, delivery and import-related items. We're also making continued progress reducing material costs, including commercial negotiations with suppliers. Model S and X ASPs increased even accounting for revenue deferrals related to free unlimited supercharging. And Model 3 ASPs declined slightly driven by mix in Asia, pricing action in EMEA. North American ASPs held flat as mix improved, offsetting pricing action we took at the start of the quarter, which is great to see.TESLA, INC.

And finally, on net income -- in other income, we saw benefits from foreign exchange which, as I mentioned last quarter, we don't hedge. The second key point I want to highlight is that we demonstrated another quarter of strong free cash flows despite a significant increase in our captive leasing mix and a sequential increase in CapEx spend. This has enabled year-to-date positive free cash flows for the company. Our cash balance increased by approximately the same amount as our free cash flows, and we exited the quarter with our highest quarter ending cash balance ever of just over $5.3 billion. Specifically, on captive leases, we received a number of questions on how these are funded. We use our leasing warehouse and ABS sales to allow for captive leases without material use of cash. What's important to note here is that our warehouse and ABS flow through financing cash flow and, as a result, leases negatively impact free cash flow. This impact was material in Q3 as the lease rate increased substantially by"

We received a number of questions on why our capital spending appears low compared to prior levels even though there are multiple new projects launching and in development. As we noted in the shareholder letter this quarter and last quarter, this is because we've made great progress on improving our capital efficiency. My third and final point is around demand and growth. Our global order rate remains strong and continues to increase. Despite increases to production levels, our order backlog has been growing. And quarter-to- date orders are significantly higher than at this point in last quarter. In the immediate term, we're focused on increasing production of Model 3 and Model S and X as quickly as we can. The bulk of this work involves continued optimization of existing equipment. We've also made targeted adjustments to pricing to better balance supply and demand. Our pace of execution on these factories and capacity expansion has increased significantly. As Elon mentioned, the first phase of Gigafactory Shanghai is already production-ready, and we've been able to pull in the time line for other major projects. Overall, we are"

Kunal Girotra Senior Director of Energy Operations Hi, everyone. My name is Kunal Girotra, and I've been with Tesla for about 4 years, working on different aspects of deploying our energy products. I now run Tesla Energy's deployment and fulfillment teams. Over the last 3 months, the energy teams have made great progress in both our solar and energy storage businesses. As you can see in our quarterly deck, our solar deployments rose by almost 50% over the last quarter.

So it's kind of a no- brainer. It's really do you want something that prints money? And if it doesn't print money, we'll fix it or take it back. It's kind of a no-brainer. And it sort of plays into Tesla's overarching strategy here, which is effectively to become like a giant distributed global utility on the energy front. Kunal Girotra Senior Director of Energy Operations Yes, absolutely. The subscription solar offering that you mentioned was launched in 6 states.

And the Zillow study showed a 4% increase in the value of the home with solar. And then if you add sort of the Powerwall, which gives you blackout protection, so you will have energy security in an event of rolling blackouts or if the power goes up for any reason, which appears to be a long-term systemic issue in California particularly, that I think this definitely can be viewed as a significant asset for any home.

Elon, other than robotaxis and autonomous vehicle capabilities, when you look over the next 3 years, what are you most excited about at Tesla that you believe investors don't understand or have missed? Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director I think there's generally a lack of understanding or appreciation for the growth of Tesla Energy, as Kunal was talking about.

And part of it is like for -- I don't know, for about 18 months, almost 2 years, we had to divert a tremendous amount of resources -- well, we had to basically take resources from everywhere else in the company and apply them to the Model 3 production, fixing the Model 3 production ramp and simplifying the design of Model 3. So for about 1.5 years, we unfortunately stripped Tesla Energy of engineering and other resources and even took the cell production lines that were meant for Powerwall and Powerpack and redirected them to the car because we didn't have enough cells. Now that we feel that Model 3 production is in a good place and headed to a great place, we've restored resources to Tesla solar and storage. And so that's going to be, I think, the really crazy growth for as far as future as I can imagine. But we had to do it because if we didn't solve Model 3, Tesla wouldn't survive.

And, I mean, Tesla's mission from the beginning has been to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. That means sustainable energy generation and sustainable energy consumption in the form of vehicles, electric vehicles. And I think one of the stats we'll publish in the future along with our vehicle production is that how much sustainable energy Tesla produced or Tesla customers produced with our products. And I think you'll see that we're producing about the same or comparable amounts of sustainable energy as are consumed in the car -- in our cars. Because for the longest time, the rebuttal against electric cars are like oh, don't they use dirty power from coal? Well, no, we're solar-powered.

The next question from investor is related to Full Self-Driving attach rates. Given that self-driving regulations will evolve unevenly in different markets, would you consider selling modules individually, for example, Navigating on Autopilot or Summon versus current strategy of selling the package as a whole in order to encourage adoption and getting more data? Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director I think we'll continue to sell it in a bundled fashion. I mean, any Tesla that you buy already has basic Autopilot included. So I think that really is a pretty major advantage relative to other cars. And then the next step will be Full Self-Driving with Smart Summon being kind of the beginning of that. And obviously, we kind of have the 2 sides of it with highway Autopilot and we've got the Summon, which is sort of low speed and talking less, that kind of thing.

But in terms of the functionality -- so basic functionality is aspirationally end of this year, but reliable enough that you do not need to pay attention, in our opinion, by the end of next year.

And we expect that this will only increase as folks understand the products better and receive some of the known price increases coming from some of the standard carriers that they'll come to us and look for an alternative. There's a bunch of work happening behind the scenes on improving the product, particularly the purchase flow, to make sure it's the best product experience for our customers. And we're also working very hard to get other states lined up in the States and then also to launch in some countries internationally. So we're not able to provide specific time lines on those changes, but we're definitely working as quickly as we can given how well received Tesla Insurance has been in California. Elon R.

I mean ultimately, what makes the most sense for total cost of ownership perspective is for folks to have good pricing on their insurance. Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director Yes, exactly. Martin Viecha Senior Director for Investor Relations Okay. And the last question from retail investors. There's skepticism regarding your comment that the Full Self-Driving will be feature-complete by year-end, like resulting from confusion about feature-complete, what feature-complete means. Could you please talk to this and perhaps give us a list of features that establish the FSD baseline? Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director Feature-complete, I mean, it's able -- the car's able to drive from one's house to work, most likely without interventions. So it will still be supervised, but it will be able to drive -- it will fill in the gap from low- speed autonomy -- we've got low-speed autonomy with Summon. We've got high-speed autonomy on the highway. And we've got intermediate"

Galves Wolfe Research, LLC I was hoping that you could give us a little bit more color on sizing up the key factors in the auto gross margin improvement from Q3 to Q2. Particularly, you mentioned some nonrecurring items in the letter. And also, should investors be prepared for any meaningful headwinds as the China plant comes up but isn't at full production yet? Zachary Kirkhorn Chief Financial Officer Yes. I can provide a couple of comments on that. So on your final -- on your last question about China headwinds, there are always ramp inefficiencies when we launch a new factory. So we don't expect China to be any different than that. So there will be some that we experience in Q4. The amount of that is hard to forecast given that it's a different type of factory design than we did here in Fremont. We're working very hard to limit the ramp inefficiencies, but certainly, fixed cost absorption and having all of the labor ready as we ramp will have an impact on Q4. And on the margin improvement, a couple of things there for auto"

Is it a fair assumption to say that once the Shanghai Gigafactory has ramped, the Model 3s sold in China for China could be the most profitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont right now? Zachary Kirkhorn Chief Financial Officer That one is also difficult to forecast. It's a good question. At least based on the plans that we have now, we're expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model 3 is coming out of our Fremont factory. There's still a bunch of work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch with ramp inefficiencies, and we need to work those costs down. And then there will be work to land on what the right mix is within the country and where we ultimately land on the product offering. So I think just for now, it's safe to"

Can you just talk about the longer-term plan or your vision for the direction of this software platform and if you have plans to monetize that opportunity? Elon R.

But now that -- as that has stabilized, we're able to focus our attention and balance that between S and X and Model 3. And so the delivery numbers in Q3 understated the interest in the product for that quarter. And we continue to see strength in the order rate, which we anticipate will be reflected in S and X deliveries in Q4. Elon R.

Given that this is a brand-new capacity, how smooth should we expect production to be on a week-to-week basis?

You mentioned -- Elon, you mentioned earlier in your comments that one of the things you're optimistic on in the future is Tesla Energy.
