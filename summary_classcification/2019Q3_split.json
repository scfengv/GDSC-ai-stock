Please go ahead.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you, Sherrine. And good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2019 Q&A Webcast.\nI'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were\nannounced at about 2 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.\nDuring this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These\ncomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ\nmaterially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings\nwith the SEC. ["

        "paragraph4": "But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nThank you. First of all, I'd like to just thank the Tesla team for an incredible job this quarter. The execution\nwas outstanding and on just about every front. So it's just an honor to work with such a great team.\nQ4 -- Q3 was obviously a very strong quarter. And we had record deliveries. We're able to make great\nstrides in controlling our costs. We shifted back to GAAP profitability while also generating strong free cash\nflow. And again, this would not be possible without each employee doing their part to reduce cost. Our\noperating cost is now at the lowest level since Model 3 production started.\nRegarding Gigafactory Shanghai, this month, we started trial production at Giga Shanghai in both vehicles\nfrom body to paint to general assembly. So this is a -- I want to emphasize, this is a real factory with a\ntremendous amount of equipment in it. While a lot of people see the outside shell of the factory, which is\nenormous and it was essentially underwater in January, it was just below the water table literally, what is,\nI think, much more significant is that we're able to install massive stamping machines, a fully operational\npaint shop and a sophisticated general assembly line in the same period of time in parallel with building\nthe building.\nI'd like to thank our entire team for this extraordinary achievement. I'm not aware of any factory of this\nmagnitude in history being constructed in such a short period of time, approximately 10 months. As far as\nI know, this is unprecedented. And Gigafactory Shanghai will become a template for future growth. We're\nplanning to build Model Ys in Shanghai as well, of course, and build a Gigafactory in Europe. And we hope\nto announce the location of that Gigafactory -- in fact, we will announce the location of that Gigafactory\nbefore the end of this year.\nRegarding Model Y, we're also ahead of schedule on Model Y preparations in Fremont. And we've moved\nthe launch time line from fall 2020 to summer 2020. There may be some room for improvement there, but\nwe're confident about summer 2020.\nI've actually recently driven the Model Y Release Candidate, and I think it's going to an amazing product\nand be very well received. I think it's quite likely to -- it's just my opinion, but I think it will outsell S, X\nand 3 combined.TESLA, INC.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5Regarding Version 10 and Smart Summon, last month, we released our latest software, Version 10, which\nincludes video streaming, games, karaoke, Spotify and a host of other new features and improvements.\nMost importantly, it includes the first version of Smart Summon, which has now been used 1 million\ntimes. So it's now over 1 million users of Smart Summon. And we're -- in the next week or so, we will be\nreleasing an improved version of Smart Summon, taking into account all the data from those 1 million\nSmart Summon attempts.\nSo this really illustrates the value of having a massive fleet because it allows us to collect these corner\ncases and learn from them and use fleet learning and become rapidly better, just as Navigate on Autopilot\ndid on the freeway. So expect a number of improvements in Smart Summon in the weeks to come. And\nthis really is just the beginning as we collect more data and Autopilot and Full Self-Driving functionality\ngets better.\nI do -- while it's going to be tight, it still does appear that we will be at least in limited -- in early access\nrelease of a feature-complete Full Self-Driving future this year. So it's not for sure, but it appears to be on\ntrack for at least the early access release of a fully functional Full Self-Driving by the end of this year.\nAnd yes, lastly, we're highly focused on decisions that really make a material difference to the company\nsuch as opening Gigafactories in other continents. Yes, it's worth noting that these -- ultimately, having 3\nGigafactories, effectively, we'll actually triple our output. And then when you consider increased output per\nGigafactory, it's going to actually more than triple our output over time.\nAnd then there are a lot of interesting things happening with respect to advanced batteries and more\nefficient powertrains and Full Self-Driving, all that sort of stuff. But that will be something for a future\ntime.\nAnd then one last item is that tomorrow afternoon, we will be releasing version 3 of the Tesla Solar Roof.\nThat's the integrated solar -- with solar panels integrated with the roof. So that's -- I think this is a great\nproduct. Version 1 and 2, we're still sort of figuring things out. Version 3, I think, is finally ready for the\nbig time. And so we're scaling up production of the version 3 solar tower roof at our Buffalo Gigafactory.\nAnd I think this product is going to be incredible. But we'll talk more about that on the official product\nlaunch, which will be tomorrow afternoon.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you very much. And I think Zachary has some remarks as well.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. Thank you, Elon. Thank you, Martin. Q3 was a great quarter for Tesla. I know many employees are\nlistening right now, and I want to thank you for your passion and your hard work. We've made terrific\nprogress, and yet again, we realized margin improvement in nearly every aspect of the business.\nThere are 3 key points I'd like to highlight. First, we returned to profitability in Q3, aided by improved\ngross profit, reduced operating expenses in the absence of negative onetime items that weighed on our\nfinancials in the first half of the year. GAAP automotive gross margin improved sequentially to 22.8% and\nover 20% excluding regulatory credits.\nWe achieved these improvements through higher production volumes on S/X and Model 3, enabling better\nfixed cost absorption. We realized improvements in labor hours per vehicle as well as other costs such as\nwarehousing, logistics, delivery and import-related items. We're also making continued progress reducing\nmaterial costs, including commercial negotiations with suppliers.\nModel S and X ASPs increased even accounting for revenue deferrals related to free unlimited\nsupercharging. And Model 3 ASPs declined slightly driven by mix in Asia, pricing action in EMEA. North\nAmerican ASPs held flat as mix improved, offsetting pricing action we took at the start of the quarter,\nwhich is great to see.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 23, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6Note that with the release of Smart Summon in the U.S., we were able to recognize $30 million of deferred\nrevenue. As we expand Smart Summon to additional markets and release new features, we'll continue to\nrecognize additional deferred revenue.\nOur services and other loss reduced yet again, reflecting our focus to improve the efficiency of this area\nof the business. And we further reduced operating expenses despite increased orders, deliveries and new\nprograms in development.\nAnd finally, on net income -- in other income, we saw benefits from foreign exchange which, as I\nmentioned last quarter, we don't hedge.\nThe second key point I want to highlight is that we demonstrated another quarter of strong free cash\nflows despite a significant increase in our captive leasing mix and a sequential increase in CapEx spend.\nThis has enabled year-to-date positive free cash flows for the company. Our cash balance increased\nby approximately the same amount as our free cash flows, and we exited the quarter with our highest\nquarter ending cash balance ever of just over $5.3 billion.\nSpecifically, on captive leases, we received a number of questions on how these are funded. We use\nour leasing warehouse and ABS sales to allow for captive leases without material use of cash. What's\nimportant to note here is that our warehouse and ABS flow through financing cash flow and, as a result,\nleases negatively impact free cash flow. This impact was material in Q3 as the lease rate increased\nsubstantially by 50%.\nIn addition, CapEx spend increased driven primarily by Gigafactory Shanghai and Model Y spending. We\nreceived a number of questions on why our capital spending appears low compared to prior levels even\nthough there are multiple new projects launching and in development. As we noted in the shareholder\nletter this quarter and last quarter, this is because we've made great progress on improving our capital\nefficiency.\nMy third and final point is around demand and growth. Our global order rate remains strong and continues\nto increase. Despite increases to production levels, our order backlog has been growing. And quarter-to-\ndate orders are significantly higher than at this point in last quarter.\nIn the immediate term, we're focused on increasing production of Model 3 and Model S and X as quickly\nas we can. The bulk of this work involves continued optimization of existing equipment. We've also\nmade targeted adjustments to pricing to better balance supply and demand. Our pace of execution on\nthese factories and capacity expansion has increased significantly. As Elon mentioned, the first phase of\nGigafactory Shanghai is already production-ready, and we've been able to pull in the time line for other\nmajor projects.\nOverall, we are quickly turning the corner for our next phase of growth, and our financial health continues\nto strengthen. We remain focused on reducing cost, which enables rapid investments in future programs\nand growth.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you very much, and I think also, our Senior Director of Energy Operations, Kunal Girotra, wanted to\nadd some remarks.\nKunal Girotra\nSenior Director of Energy Operations\nHi, everyone. My name is Kunal Girotra, and I've been with Tesla for about 4 years, working on different\naspects of deploying our energy products. I now run Tesla Energy's deployment and fulfillment teams.\nOver the last 3 months, the energy teams have made great progress in both our solar and energy storage\nbusinesses. As you can see in our quarterly deck, our solar deployments rose by almost 50% over the last\nquarter. And our energy storage deployment, which includes Powerwalls and Powerpacks, grew by 15% to\nan all-time high of 477 megawatt hours.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 23, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7In the last 3 months, we relaunched Tesla solar in North America by simplifying our solar offering into 3\nsizes of small, medium and large. We're transferring pricing on the website.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nActually, if I may interject a minute, but what a lot of people don't realize is in -- like in California and\nin a number of other states, if you buy our sort of solar subscription or solar rental, there's no money\ndown and you instantly save on your utility bill and there's no long-term contract. So it's kind of a no-\nbrainer. It's really do you want something that prints money? And if it doesn't print money, we'll fix it or\ntake it back. It's kind of a no-brainer. And it sort of plays into Tesla's overarching strategy here, which is\neffectively to become like a giant distributed global utility on the energy front.\nKunal Girotra\nSenior Director of Energy Operations\nYes, absolutely. The subscription solar offering that you mentioned was launched in 6 states. And like you\nsaid, it's fixed monthly payments and no long-term contracts. And the response from customers have\nbeen pretty awesome.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nMost people do actually buy it as opposed to rent it, which is actually technically the better -- while you\nmake money is immediately if you're rental, it's actually a better investment if you buy it because the cost\nof capital of the consumer is better than our cost of capital.\nAnd then there was like an interesting study by Zillow and a number of other organizations that show that\nadding solar to your home increases the price of -- increases the value of your home. And the Zillow study\nshowed a 4% increase in the value of the home with solar. And then if you add sort of the Powerwall,\nwhich gives you blackout protection, so you will have energy security in an event of rolling blackouts\nor if the power goes up for any reason, which appears to be a long-term systemic issue in California\nparticularly, that I think this definitely can be viewed as a significant asset for any home.\nKunal Girotra\nSenior Director of Energy Operations\nTotally, yes. Yes, I think to your point of buying Tesla solar is easy because we have one of the lowest\nprices in the nation now -- in the country. And just a little bit of a story there, we were able to lower our\nprices because our cost of acquisition is now less than 1/4 of any typical solar company.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWe don't do sales.\nKunal Girotra\nSenior Director of Energy Operations\nYes. These are online sales, online orders.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nThere's no advertising, no marketing and no sales force. But would you rather pay for power or for\nmarketing? Yes. I'd say you'd rather pay for the product.\nKunal Girotra\nSenior Director of Energy Operations\nTotally, yes, yes. All right, that's great. On solar, we want to simplify the fulfillment process with a goal\nof really fast order-to-install time lines. We've done many residential installs with a single visit to aTESLA, INC.

We've also been working with cities\nand counties to submit generic permits that follow a template rather than customizing for every situation\nbecause...\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. Actually, Kunal, this is a really big deal. That's like the ones people won't appreciate. It's great work\nby you and the energy team to get those signed because one of the inhibitors, both from a cost and timing\nstandpoint, is getting permit approval from the various regional authorities of -- and we've pioneered a\nnovel approach. It's sort of an innovation applied to bureaucracy, frankly, which -- interfacing your client\ninnovation to try anything. And every button -- a massive number of housing approval authorities to take\na generic template as opposed to a custom template, which makes it [indiscernible] and in most cases, I\nthink electronic as well. So that just makes it simple and low cost and fast to get approval for solar, which\nis how it should be.\nKunal Girotra\nSenior Director of Energy Operations\nTotally. Yes, around 350 cities and counties have accepted it. There is still about...\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nAnd more coming.\nKunal Girotra\nSenior Director of Energy Operations\nMany more coming.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. I think ultimately, it will be almost everyone.\nKunal Girotra\nSenior Director of Energy Operations\nYes, yes. We have a lot more small cities and counties that have to come online, but that will be our\nfocus in the coming days. And it's more important as we scale Solar Roof 2 for all our -- deploying energy\nproducts needs innovation and in the bureaucracy space, as you said as well.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. I mean, yes.\nKunal Girotra\nSenior Director of Energy Operations\nYes. So all these improvements have led us to speed up our customer order-to-installation time lines from\nmonths to, in many cases, days. As, Elon, you already said, we've added the option to add Powerwalls\nto secure people from future power outages. And a home with solar and Powerwall, as was shown in the\nrecent California outages, many homes ran successfully.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. You can tell which homes have Powerwall because that's where all the light -- that's where the lights\nare on. Yes, if you look at the neighborhood, it's like oh, there's -- everywhere but a few lights aroundTESLA, INC. FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 23, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9and those are usually the ones with the Tesla Powerwall. I think -- I don't -- I'm not sure if you're going to\nmention, but also like the single truck roll. It's like\u2026\nKunal Girotra\nSenior Director of Energy Operations\nSingle site visit, yes. Single-visit install.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. Single-visit install is a big deal. We're taking it from where the solar industry would often be 3\nvisits before the solar was installed and would often take quite a long time to do the installation. But we\nstreamlined all of that to a point where, in many cases, it's a single visit to do everything, and it's fast. So\nit's like minimize disruptions to the homeowner. And ordering solar is literally 1 click. You can order solar\nfor your house in less than 1 minute. So...\nKunal Girotra\nSenior Director of Energy Operations\nYes. And then we've done the same thing in the commercial solar space. Nobody thought of putting a\nsimple website with order -- with prices for commercial solar. We do that now. And we've seen a good\nresponse from small businesses wanting to go solar. And by removing the complexity of long-term\ncontracts and simplifying the terms and conditions, the commercial solar sales process would typically take\n6 months is now taking a couple of weeks. So the same thing that we've done in residential, we want to\nexpand more and more in commercial as well.\nSo all in all, the road map for energy products from solar, Solar Roof, Powerwall to Megapack is super\nexciting. And I expect Tesla Energy to become a larger part of our overall ecosystem as we leverage and\nintegrate the same competencies from our vehicle business. The future is pretty exciting for Tesla Energy.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nGreat.\nKunal Girotra\nSenior Director of Energy Operations\nThanks again.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you very much. So first, we're going to take some questions from say.com. We will, this time, take\nquestions from both institutional investors as well as retail investors.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 23, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Question and Answer\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nSo the first question from institutional investors is, what are the opportunities for Tesla to create demand?\nIs word-of-mouth still sufficient? Or should we expect to see Tesla commence advertising in the near\nfuture?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. What we're seeing is that word-of-mouth is more than enough to drive our demand in excess of\nproduction. We have no plans to advertise at this time. Obviously, at some point in the future, we may do\nadvertising, not in the traditional sense but more to just inform people and make sure that they are aware\nof the product, but not engage in the typical trickery that is commonplace in advertising.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. The next question from institutional investors. Elon, other than robotaxis and autonomous vehicle\ncapabilities, when you look over the next 3 years, what are you most excited about at Tesla that you\nbelieve investors don't understand or have missed?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nI think there's generally a lack of understanding or appreciation for the growth of Tesla Energy, as Kunal\nwas talking about. In the long term, I expect Tesla Energy to be of the same -- roughly the same size as\nTesla's automotive sector or business.\nThis is the most underappreciated. I think it could be bigger, but it's certainly of a similar magnitude,\nTesla solar, meaning Tesla solar plus battery stuff is -- to Tesla Energy is, I think, the least appreciated\nelement. And part of it is like for -- I don't know, for about 18 months, almost 2 years, we had to divert a\ntremendous amount of resources -- well, we had to basically take resources from everywhere else in the\ncompany and apply them to the Model 3 production, fixing the Model 3 production ramp and simplifying\nthe design of Model 3.\nSo for about 1.5 years, we unfortunately stripped Tesla Energy of engineering and other resources and\neven took the cell production lines that were meant for Powerwall and Powerpack and redirected them to\nthe car because we didn't have enough cells. Now that we feel that Model 3 production is in a good place\nand headed to a great place, we've restored resources to Tesla solar and storage. And so that's going to\nbe, I think, the really crazy growth for as far as future as I can imagine.\nBut we had to do it because if we didn't solve Model 3, Tesla wouldn't survive. So unfortunately, that\nshorted pretty much the other parts of the company. But it would be difficult for me to overstate the\ndegree to which I think Tesla Energy is going to be a major part of Tesla's activity in the future.\nAnd, I mean, Tesla's mission from the beginning has been to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy.\nThat means sustainable energy generation and sustainable energy consumption in the form of vehicles,\nelectric vehicles. And I think one of the stats we'll publish in the future along with our vehicle production\nis that how much sustainable energy Tesla produced or Tesla customers produced with our products. And\nI think you'll see that we're producing about the same or comparable amounts of sustainable energy as\nare consumed in the car -- in our cars. Because for the longest time, the rebuttal against electric cars are\nlike oh, don't they use dirty power from coal? Well, no, we're solar-powered. And that's -- obviously, there\nare solar power companies, not just Tesla. But you have to sell sustainable generation and sustainable\nconsumption, and that's what we're doing, and we'll do more of it.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 23, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11Martin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you. The next question from investor is related to Full Self-Driving attach rates. Given that\nself-driving regulations will evolve unevenly in different markets, would you consider selling modules\nindividually, for example, Navigating on Autopilot or Summon versus current strategy of selling the\npackage as a whole in order to encourage adoption and getting more data?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nI think we'll continue to sell it in a bundled fashion. I mean, any Tesla that you buy already has basic\nAutopilot included. So I think that really is a pretty major advantage relative to other cars. And then the\nnext step will be Full Self-Driving with Smart Summon being kind of the beginning of that.\nAnd obviously, we kind of have the 2 sides of it with highway Autopilot and we've got the Summon, which\nis sort of low speed and talking less, that kind of thing. Now we need to -- we're working on solving that\nintermediate portion, which is traffic lights and stop signs and navigating through windy roads and --\nwindy, narrow roads and suburban neighborhoods. That's the focus right now. And you're going to want it\nall, right? I think it's -- yes, it's something that everyone's going to want, for sure.\nAnd as I said before, the point at which we're able to upload the software enabling a Tesla to become a\nrobotaxi, expect to have that from a functionality standpoint by the end of next year. But in terms of the\nfunctionality -- so basic functionality is aspirationally end of this year, but reliable enough that you do not\nneed to pay attention, in our opinion, by the end of next year. And we would need -- the acceptance by\nregulatory authorities will vary by jurisdiction. That transition, that sort of flipping of the switch from a car\nthat is from not robotaxi to robotaxi, I think will probably be the biggest step-change increase in asset\nvalue in history by far.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you. The next question is with respect to Model Y, what is your latest expectations for launch\ntiming? Do you anticipate any Model 3 production downtime at Fremont during the launch? And how\nshould Model Y gross margin percent look compared to Model 3 gross margin?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWell, we've talked about the launch timing. What really matters is the timing to volume production, where\nvolume production is some number in excess of 1,000 units per week. And we're confident of reaching\nthat point no later than the middle of 2020.\nThe -- yes, so from an interference standpoint, we do not expect it to interfere. Yes. The body line is\nseparate. The paint line is. So basically, we do not expect it to interfere with Model 3. We do not expect\nany downtime. From a margin standpoint, Zach, do you want to...\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. From a margin perspective, we're expecting ASPs for Model Y to be slightly higher than they are for\nModel 3. And this is common in the industry between sedans and CUVs. The part that we've worked very\nhard on is controlling the cost of Model Y. And our steady-state forecast for that program puts the cost\nat roughly equivalent to Model 3. So there will be ramp inefficiencies at first, of course, as we launch the\nprogram. But as it stabilizes with steady-state production, we do expect that it will be a higher-margin\nproduct. It's something that we're very excited about within the company.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor RelationsTESLA, INC. FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 23, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12Okay. Thank you. And the last question from institutional investors is, can you provide an update on FSD\npackage attach rates? As FSD attach rates improve, will you let the financial benefits manifest in higher\ngross margins for company and shareholders? Or will you lower the price to drive delivery volume?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nI don't think we're going to need to lower the price of FSD. But I expect the price of FSD to increase slowly\nas the functionality and capability improve. That's -- that is unchanged. Anything you want to add? I\nmean, our cash gross margin obviously is higher than our GAAP gross margin because of unrecognized\nrevenue associated with FSD attach rates. So that's why I think it's in the order of $600 million or in the\norder of $0.5 billion...\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\n$500 million.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\n$0.5 billion of unrecognized revenue. So if you were to include that, which would obviously be recognized\nas we release the Full Self-Driving functionality, but actual gross margin that we're operating on, on a cash\nbasis today is higher than the GAAP gross margin.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. Let's now go to questions from retail investors. The first question from Craig is, can you provide\nmore detail on the DeepScale acquisition, its importance and whether Tesla is still on track to recognize\nand respond to traffic lights and stop signs with automatic driving on city streets by the end of 2019?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nSure. DeepScale is a very tiny company. It's basically about 12 people. And it's -- they have some\nexpertise in increasing the efficiency of neural net for a given amount of compute, which I think is helpful.\nSo it remains to be seen. But the intent behind what was a very tiny acquisition, was to, I think, slightly\naccelerate FSD. That's the intent. And hopefully, that will turn out to be true. Yes.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. The second question, we've already answered regarding Model Y delivery. So we'll jump to the third\nquestion from Craig. News reports suggest that Gigafactory 3 already -- may already be producing Model\n3s for Chinese markets. Could you please update us on the production expectations for Giga 3 and confirm\npurpose of the second building now being built? Is that for battery production as suggested by some press\noutlets?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. We're in trial production of Model 3. We're basically sending cars through the system, and we're\nramping rapidly. We're expecting to hit volume production in a few months essentially.\nThe second building is, indeed, for battery and module production. And that's probably going to -- because\nthere's obviously a bunch more construction beyond what's already there because obviously, we need to\nbuild out facilities for Model Y production at Shanghai as well.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor RelationsTESLA, INC. FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 23, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 13Okay. The next question from retail investors is, can you update us on the initial results of Tesla car\ninsurance? Is there a time line to expand it nationally and internationally?\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, I can take that. So far, we've launched Tesla Insurance in California. I have to say that I'm quite\npleased by the results so far. The take rate, as measured by quote-to-purchase conversioning are quite\nhigh by industry standards. And we expect that this will only increase as folks understand the products\nbetter and receive some of the known price increases coming from some of the standard carriers that\nthey'll come to us and look for an alternative.\nThere's a bunch of work happening behind the scenes on improving the product, particularly the purchase\nflow, to make sure it's the best product experience for our customers. And we're also working very hard to\nget other states lined up in the States and then also to launch in some countries internationally. So we're\nnot able to provide specific time lines on those changes, but we're definitely working as quickly as we can\ngiven how well received Tesla Insurance has been in California.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. I think it also has a secondary effect of ensuring that the third-party providers of insurance provide\nreasonable rates to our customers.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nI completely agree. The goal here is not to have an outsized market share of insurance. It's just to\nmake sure that customers have an alternative to other companies as well if those rates are high. I mean\nultimately, what makes the most sense for total cost of ownership perspective is for folks to have good\npricing on their insurance.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes, exactly.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. And the last question from retail investors. There's skepticism regarding your comment that the Full\nSelf-Driving will be feature-complete by year-end, like resulting from confusion about feature-complete,\nwhat feature-complete means. Could you please talk to this and perhaps give us a list of features that\nestablish the FSD baseline?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nFeature-complete, I mean, it's able -- the car's able to drive from one's house to work, most likely without\ninterventions. So it will still be supervised, but it will be able to drive -- it will fill in the gap from low-\nspeed autonomy -- we've got low-speed autonomy with Summon. We've got high-speed autonomy on\nthe highway. And we've got intermediate speed autonomy, which really just means traffic lights and stop\nsigns.\nSo feature-complete means it's most likely able to do that without intervention, without human\nintervention, but it would still be supervised.\nAnd I've gone through this time line before, I think, several times. But it is often misconstrued. But there's\nlike -- there's 3 major levels to autonomy. There's the car being able to be autonomous but requiring\nsupervision and intervention at times; that's feature-complete. Then there's -- and it doesn't mean like\nevery scenario, everywhere on earth including every corner case. It means most of the time.TESLA, INC.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 14And then there's another level which is that we think it's -- that from a Tesla standpoint, we think the car\nis safe enough to be driven without supervision.\nThen the third level would be that regulators are also convinced that the car can be driven autonomously\nwithout supervision. Those are the 3 different levels.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you very much. Sherrine, we can now go to the questions from analysts."

        "paragraph6": "Our first question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research.\nDaniel V. Galves\nWolfe Research, LLC\nI was hoping that you could give us a little bit more color on sizing up the key factors in the auto gross\nmargin improvement from Q3 to Q2. Particularly, you mentioned some nonrecurring items in the letter.\nAnd also, should investors be prepared for any meaningful headwinds as the China plant comes up but\nisn't at full production yet?\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. I can provide a couple of comments on that. So on your final -- on your last question about China\nheadwinds, there are always ramp inefficiencies when we launch a new factory. So we don't expect China\nto be any different than that. So there will be some that we experience in Q4. The amount of that is hard\nto forecast given that it's a different type of factory design than we did here in Fremont. We're working\nvery hard to limit the ramp inefficiencies, but certainly, fixed cost absorption and having all of the labor\nready as we ramp will have an impact on Q4.\nAnd on the margin improvement, a couple of things there for auto gross margin. As I mentioned in my\nopening remarks, S and X average selling prices increased from Q2 to Q3. I mean that's important.\nAs I mentioned in the last earnings call, the prior powertrain versions of S and X provided significant\nheadwinds on average selling price for that product in the quarter.\nWe've also done a bunch of work as a company to become more targeted in how we adjust pricing on our\nproducts and how we optimize that based on local supply and demand. And so I think there's a bunch of\ngood work from the team on that in Q3, which flowed through on our financials.\nAnd cost reduction has just remained a huge focus for us. It's hard to underestimate how much of that has\nbeen ingrained in the culture of the company. And Jerome and his team have done absolutely tremendous\nwork there. So on every line item of our cost, whether it be manufacturing, labor, warehousing, logistics,\nthere's just a tremendous amount of good work that happened there.\nSpecifically on nonrecurring items, to that, I'll note one being the Smart Summon revenue recognition.\nDebatable whether that's considered recurring or not given that we continue to expect to release\nmore features and release revenue associated with that in the future. But we did want to call that out\nspecifically and the dollar value around that as we know there's been speculation around the impact for\nthe quarter.\nAnd foreign exchange is just something that, since we don't hedge, it has an impact. And it comes and\ngoes every quarter. So we'll have to see if the quarter plays out the effect that, that has."

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 15Morgan Stanley, Research Division\nThis is George Dailey on for Adam. So first question. Is it a fair assumption to say that once the Shanghai\nGigafactory has ramped, the Model 3s sold in China for China could be the most profitable car you sell,\neven more profitable than the average car made at Fremont right now?\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nThat one is also difficult to forecast. It's a good question. At least based on the plans that we have now,\nwe're expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model 3 is coming out of our Fremont factory. There's\nstill a bunch of work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch with ramp inefficiencies, and\nwe need to work those costs down. And then there will be work to land on what the right mix is within the\ncountry and where we ultimately land on the product offering. So I think just for now, it's safe to assume\nthat it's roughly in line with the margins that you see coming out of the Fremont facility.\nGeorge M. Dailey\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nGreat. And if I could just sneak in one more. So it's been over 7 years since you launched the Model S,\nand many OEMs seem that they don't have the same commitment to battery electric vehicles that you do,\nand many don't even offer one right now. As your business model proves to be more sustainable, could\nwe potentially see Tesla maybe supplying other OEMs with batteries or software, complete electric vehicle\narchitectures maybe in an effort to accelerate mass adoption of sustainable transport?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. I think there's -- it will be consistent with the mission of Tesla to help other car companies with\nelectric vehicles on the battery and powertrain fronts, also in other fronts. So it's something we're open to.\nAs I think a lot of people know, we open-source our patents so that those would not serve as an obstacle\nto the adoption of electric vehicles or solar power or stationary storage. And we're definitely open to\nsupplying batteries and powertrains and perhaps other things to other car companies."

        "paragraph8": "Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Macquarie.\nMaynard Joseph Um\nMacquarie Research\nI have 2 questions. The first is software Version 10 added a lot of functionality that's never really been\navailable in a car before through an over-the-air update. In your shareholder letter, you say that this lays\nan important foundation for things to come. Can you just talk about the longer-term plan or your vision for\nthe direction of this software platform and if you have plans to monetize that opportunity?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWell, the goal for the infotainment system is to say what's the most amount of fun you can have in a car,\nwhich I think is -- I don't think other car companies really think about it that way. But it's really what is\nthe most fun -- how can we maximize the enjoyment in a car such that it's not some -- just some sort of\ntransport utility device with no soul and no character. We want it to be fun and entertaining in reference to\nsomething that you love.\nAnd so just I think there's a lot one can do because people are generally spending a couple of hours a day\non average in the car. And so that's pretty high percentage of the waking time, outside of like showering\nand going to the bathroom and that kind of thing. It's just a lot of time. And I guess maybe there's some\nway to monetize it but we haven't really thought about it that way.TESLA, INC.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 16But our goal is just to make -- try to say what is the most fun you could possibly have while you're in\nyour car. And obviously, as autonomy gets better and better, that is going to become much more of an\nentertainment opportunity. So we'll see where that leads. But that's what we're after. It's our goal.\nMaynard Joseph Um\nMacquarie Research\nGreat. And then can you help us -- help frame for us the opportunity for emission credits as the standards\nin the EU start to tighten next year? And I'm not looking for an exact number but maybe more to\nunderstand whether this is an opportunity in the tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions. Anything to\nhelp us frame the opportunity and also whether you have any ongoing dialogues with OEMs.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWe certainly have ongoing dialogues with OEMs. But as you see from our financials, the tax credits or\nemissions credits are not forming a very big percentage of our revenue. They're -- I mean, Zach, what\nwas the last quarter? It was really quite...\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nIt was over $100 million.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nBut out of like several billions. So it's like 1.5%. It's not exactly a giant percentage. And obviously, those\ncredits in the U.S. are really not -- a credit situation not particularly strong for obvious reasons, which we\nthink is not great for the future. But anyway, that's the way it is.\nIn Europe, it's much more of a sensitivity to the environment. But we're not counting on some big\nwindfall. Maybe it will be good. Maybe not. We don't know. But we're not counting on it.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. I think that's a fair way to characterize it. I mean our expectation is that credit revenues will generally\nincrease with time, not necessarily increasing every quarter. We did increase from Q2 to Q3. But there's\na certain amount of them that are baseline based on the number of cars that we build and deliver. And\nthere's others that are deal-specific, and those deals can happen at any point.\nSo we're constantly in conversations with automakers about this. But within the company, we manage\nthe business without counting on any profit or cash flows from regulatory credit. And we view it as purely\nincremental, and my recommendation is that everyone should view it that way. It's just an extra that\ncomes through.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nIt's obviously a good thing to do that would help accelerate the advent of sustainable energy for sure. But\nit's -- and like I say, I think outside the U.S., there seems to be a strong push in that direction, which is\ngreat. And probably within the U.S., that over time will become a strong push."

Just curious if you have any updates, any more insights you can share on the one that you're about\nto put out later.\nAnd then secondly, there was a comment, I think, earlier about the order book quarter to date. Can you\njust clarify what was the baseline? And any insights about the geographic mix of that?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. We -- I think we've said enough about the Tesla side of the truck. We're not going to -- this is not\nthe right forum for us to do product launches. But I think it'll be -- will be -- I mean, my opinion, and\nthis could be totally wrong, it could be totally out to lunch here, but I think the Tesla side of truck is our\nbest product ever. That's my opinion. Yes. The demand is not -- it seems to be strong. So we should be\nproduction-constrained this quarter.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, that's right. The baseline from the comment earlier that I made was looking at this point in the\nquarter in Q2. And order rates are strong, I would say, in all markets. I think we're very encouraged as a\nteam at the reception of our products. As more and more people become aware of electric vehicles, I think\ncompetitive products help raise that awareness, and overall interest is just increasing.\nSo our focus internally is to increase production as fast as we can, both with the existing equipment and\naccelerating our timelines on new capacity. We believe that everybody should be driving an electric car. So\nwe need to move as quickly as we can.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes, absolutely. But we want to get the Tesla volume to where it is, perhaps somewhere on the order of\n1% -- replacing 1% of the global fleet over time. That's, I think -- we think it's pretty big, but that's -- we\nthink that's a good one to aim for, which is about 20 million vehicles a year, just by the way.\nBut I do think that the demand for new cars will rise as the world transitions away from combustion\nengine vehicles. Just as when people had CRT TVs, there's no cathode ray tube TVs, the sales rate was\njust basically a replacement rate. You wouldn't buy -- you wouldn't really buy a new CRT TV unless it was\nbroke. But when flat screens came out, there was a big step-change in demand because now getting a big\nflat screen TV was much better than having a small CRT TV.\nAnd I think we'll see the same thing with electric vehicles, which is that the -- it's not just people are just\nbuying a car just because their last car wore out. They'll buy an electric car because it's a fundamentally\nbetter car, and especially if it's got self-driving."

Ferragu\nNew Street Research LLP\nOkay. Sorry for that. So I was wondering how your thinking has evolved on Model S and Model X. It\nlooks like the deliveries have stayed to the levels of the previous quarter and that Model 3 has indeed\ncannibalized this demand for these cars quite a big deal. So how are you thinking about these 2 models\ngoing forward? What's the strategy you have in mind? And then I have a quick follow-up on the Model Y.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nThe Models S and X are really niche -- they're really niche products. I mean they're very expensive, made\nin low volume. To be totally frank, we'll keep -- we're continuing to make them more for sentimental\nreasons than anything else. They're really of minor importance to the future.\nPierre C. Ferragu\nNew Street Research LLP\nOkay. That makes sense. And then my question...\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nThey're a great car. Model S, I think, is by -- if you want to -- I mean Model S literally won Motor Trend's\nbest car ever in history, by the way. I think if you're out there and you're buying -- and you're sedan-\nbuying and you don't buy a Model S, I think you've just made a mistake, to be totally frank. It's incredible,\nespecially the new one with variable damping, suspension, hospital operating room, HEPA filter for air\npurification, the Raven powertrain. It's the fastest car in the world. And it's just it's so easy to drive. It\nmakes you feel like Superman driving that car. It's incredibly safe. It's just an amazing vehicle.\nAnd then Model S, I think, it's like the Faberg\u00e9 egg of cars -- I mean Model X. Model X is like the Faberg\u00e9\negg of cars. It's -- I mean that's why so many artists and musicians buy the cars. It's an art piece,\nbasically.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. I mean it's just that. I agree. They're absolutely phenomenal cars. And we are increasing production\non kind of S and X lines for this quarter in response to increasing demand. And so I think part of the story\nhere is, as we've launched, ramped and stabilized Model 3, that consumes a lot of the attention around\nthe company. But now that -- as that has stabilized, we're able to focus our attention and balance that\nbetween S and X and Model 3.\nAnd so the delivery numbers in Q3 understated the interest in the product for that quarter. And we\ncontinue to see strength in the order rate, which we anticipate will be reflected in S and X deliveries in Q4.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nI mean Model S -- basically, Model S at this point has a range of 370 miles. Actually, technically, it's 373,\nbut we actually certified it incorrectly at 370. But it's 373. And there are some software improvements that\nwe think will make that even better.\nOh I forgot to mention, we're also expecting that there's going to be out there improvement -- that will\nimprove the power of the Model S, X and 3.

And have you started to think about that and how to approach it?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nNo, I don't think -- we're not expecting to see cannibalization of Model 3. One is a sedan. One is an SUV.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. The best comparison we have for that is when we launched Model X and we had Model S at the time.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. Model S sales increased.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. And we didn't see any cannibalization there.\nElon R.

You're targeting 3,000 units a week. But we saw with\nFremont that the ramp on Model 3 was lumpy. And you'd sort of ramp and then you sort of cut production\nto fix the bottlenecks. Given that this is a brand-new capacity, how smooth should we expect production\nto be on a week-to-week basis?

But -- and I think\nif you look over a reasonable enough time frame, the production will actually be fairly smooth. But from a\nweek-to-week standpoint, it obviously will not be. It will be about as smooth as, say, the stock market. I\nmean how smooth is the stock market from one week to the next?

You mentioned -- Elon, you mentioned earlier in your comments\nthat one of the things you're optimistic on in the future is Tesla Energy. And I think we understand the part\nthat one of the challenges in the past was sort of a reallocation of resources away from energy to the auto\nside. Could you just talk to where you see the greatest pockets of growth in energy? Is it solar or storage?\nAnd now that you have to -- now that you can reallocate resources, what would that entail in terms of\ncapacity growth? Or what does reallocation of resources look like?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWell, I think from a percentage basis, solar will grow the fastest, but storage will also grow high on a\npercentage basis. I think both, over time, will grow faster than automotive. I think it's starting from\nsmaller base. And I think especially if you look at sort of -- if you look at like year-over-year growth, it will\nbe absolutely incredible, I think. From one quarter to the next, there might be some fluctuations due to\nseasonality or some short-term part shortage or you name it, but it could be, over the course of, say, a\nyear, gigantic increase.\nAlso with solar, it's hard to install a lot of solar in the winter, especially on the East Coast. The roofs are full\nof snow and ice. So you would expect to see some seasonality there, but then it ramps up quite a bit when\n-- as the weather improves.
