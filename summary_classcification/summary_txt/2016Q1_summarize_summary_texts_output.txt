"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We're advancing the Q3 -- I'm sorry, the Model 3 build plan substantially. He says Tesla is going to be hell-bent on becoming the best manufacturer on earth. Musk: The key thing we need to achieve in the future is to also be the leader in manufacturing."

"summary_text": "Elon Musk: With Model 3, we're being incredibly rigorous about ensuring that we don't have anything that isn't really necessary. The date we are setting with suppliers to get to a volume production capability with the Model 3 is July 1 next year. Even if 99% of the internally produced items are available on July 1, we still cannot produce the car, because you cannot produce a car."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I think we've got an excellent team at Tesla in production. And there's -- we'readding world-class aces in production with each passing week. It is a huge advantage to have the most -- I think it's better to say it's probably the most compelling product program in the world with the Model 3."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I think it's -- our sort of operating leverage, I mean, just sort of fixed costs relative to ourvariable costs has been improved dramatically as you get volume up. Jason S. Wheeler: We updated our guidance on OpEx for the year a little bit in the letter."
"summary_text": "Tesla's CapEx for this quarter was $216 million, which was a 47% decrease over Q4. We're just really focusing, as Elon has said, on capital efficiency and making sure that we are investing in the highest and best uses of cash. And then second to that, I would probably ask the same question just on the R&D front."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: From an engineering standpoint, we're already almost complete with the design of Model 3. The -- so the -- and -- so with -- sort of completing the final release for tooling no later than the end of June. That sort of leaves roughly 9 months for the tools to be manufactured, which, I think, is an achievable timeframe."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I think you've pretty much asked the question and then answered it. The -- I mean, data is everything, really, when you're trying to solve the autonomous transport problem. In order for regulators to be comfortable approving that, they're going to want to see a very large amount of data, like, maybe billions of miles."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We have a lot more capacity at that site than the initial 35 to -- and 15 gigawatt hours that we discussed. That's part of why we've so aggressively made sure that we have extra land and extra space around the site. And we won't need to rob from Tesla Energy plans to meet the Model 3 schedule."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: The July 1 date is not a date that will actually be met. It is an impossible date because there's 6,000, 7,000 unique components in the Model 3. The Model 3 will -- is the first car Tesla's creating that is designed to be easy to make, but this is really a fundamental difference."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I don't think we want to rely too much on customer reservation money as a source of capital. Tesla doesn't ship to dealers. The car is complete, and it's going to a known customer. So really, the only risk associated with that is if like the ship sinks."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We believe that, that is not a constraint on our ability to achieve the plan. Jason S. Wheeler: On that, so yes, I don't want to go into the details of what we think the total capital cost is going \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0to be for the Model 3 program."
"summary_text": "Just about 93% of the reservation holders, this is their firstTESLA, INC. FQ1 2016 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 04, 2016. Charles Lowell Anderson with Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division. I imagine, for many of them, this was their firstinteraction with Tesla and maybe the first time they went to a store. And I wonder, as you've looked at that base, if there's any potential to up-sell to an S or X in the interim while they wait for their car."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: Our plans for international expansion, establishment of new plants are sort of speculative. We haven't made any firm decision, but I mean, some of the things are just sort of common sense, that manufacturing cars in California and then shipping them all around the world is not a very efficient thing to do."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I feel confident that we're going to hit like the 2000-vehicle-a-week target by the end of this quarter. The average battery pack size for the 3 will be less than 75 kilowatt-hours, he said. Musk: There's no question, the X is a very difficult car to manufacture."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I feel confident about the top line number, but the mix internally is -- it's difficult to figure out. SpaceX has a great COO and has had one since the company -- for years, but Tesla never has. SpaceX is more of a pure technology company and does not have the sort of sales, service and kind of fleet management."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We actually believe that Fremont and the Gigafactory could scale to 1 million vehicles. Whether that's actually wise is a separate question. And as I said earlier, it's going to make sense to do localized production, at least on a continent basis."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: Tesla believes strongly in making things. We believe that manufacturing technology is itself subject to a tremendousamount of innovation. Tesla believes that a company that values manufacturing as highly as we do is going to attract the best minds in manufacturing. Those that didn't perform very well on, say, prior tasks are unlikely to be selected for the Model 3 program."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We'll talk to you in a quarter. Bye-bye. Jeff Evanson: Thank you everyone for joining us today. Elon Musk: I'm looking forward to hearing from you again in a few months. Jeff: Thanks, Elon. Back to you."
