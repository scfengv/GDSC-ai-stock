"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: The ramp curve is a step exponential. So it means like as you alleviate a constraint, the production jumps -- suddenly jumps at a much higher number. Deepak Ahuja: It does not change any of our projections in terms of the long-term target gross margin."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I was reallydepressed about 3 or 4 weeks ago when I realized that we were kind of in level 9. Then we got to level 8. Now I can see sort of a clear path to sunshine. The whole team's on it, we're on it. And we've got it covered."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: Model 3 is much easier to build than S or X because the system is designed as a very tightly automated system. Musk: The number of actual, what we call a pitch, which is a station for a robot to work on the car in general assembly, is about 1/4 of the typical industry average for number of stations."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I think that we'll be able to achieve full autonomy with the current hardware. For customers that have signed up for full subject riding capability, we'll push that option. The -- if it does turn out that a computer upgrade is necessary in order to meet the regulatory requirements in that area, we will replace their computer."
"summary_text": "Deepak Ahuja: As we continue to ramp up Model 3, our cash flow of operations is going to increase or improve significantly over the next few quarters. We are managing our CapEx and OpEx growth to be in line with the growth of our fleet. So all those actions will come through in terms of helping us conserve cash."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: It's a bit too early to make the exact number. But I think, if you extrapolate from 5,000 units towards the end of Q1, we do want to hold off on giving CapEx until we are confident about cash flow on Model 3."
"summary_text": "The goal is right now to fix the problem. We will be able to call back some amounts, but it certainly will not make up for the lost revenue, the lost free cash flow. We've introduced the 100-kilowatt battery pack, which has a 335-mile range in Model S. We also just increased the amount of value that's in a Model S..."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We want to make sure we know what to scale before we spend money on it. He's just giving a broad guidance. It's like one moment to the next, the next moment it's suddenly very different. The China plan is sort of maybe something like -- this is just a -- like don't set your watch by this."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We're talking about a rate ofgrowth faster than the Model T, which is the fastest in history. So these are nutty growth rates. Next year even with 5,000, it'll be like crazy compared to this year. So our growth rate continues to be extraordinary."
"summary_text": "Revenue was up $180 million, costs were up $247 million. In terms of the drivetrain issue that you mentioned, that's mostly behind us. The reliability for S and X continues to improve. The CPO business, for us, last year -- or last quarter was about a $238 million revenue business."
"summary_text": "The next question comes from Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Joseph: Is there still going to be a discrepancy between the run rate of different parts of the entire line? Or do you think everything will be roughly at the same level? Elon: We actually feel even more strongly that our efficiency of CapEx will be significant compared to the first phase."
"summary_text": "The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Could you talk about the percentage of sales that are coming from these loaners to the fleet vehicles? And then, if you could talk a little bit about why you felt that it was necessary to add value to the Model S and Model X while lowering price."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We are -- we do expect the solar demand to rebound as we move solar sales into all of our stores. The Solar Roof stuff, we expect, is going to be at -- or well, we're confident it's going to haveextremely high demand. And we continue to install pilot engineering, early customer homes."
