"summary_text": "Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and a number of other executives will discuss Tesla's third quarter results. During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: This was an incrediblyhistoric quarter for Tesla. Model 3 production stabilized. We delivered a total of 84,000 vehicles globally, more than 80% of vehicles that we delivered in all of 2017. We achieved GAAP net income of over $300 million, increased cash and equivalents by $731 million."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We are making a pretty nutty amount of the world's lithium-ion batteries. We have had a period where the supply was fairly tight for Model 3. But it did not really constrain the Model 3 production in any significant way. The productivity of existing lines is continuing to improve."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We expect to start producing a significant volume for Europe in January. And also to APAC, we start delivering cars. The -- we may or may not deliver cars in APAC in Q1 but certainly in Q2. It will be kind of borderline as to whether cars are delivered in APAP by the end of Q1."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: It's hard to predict with accuracy. The -- and there's also like all the tariff wars and everything. So long term, I'd like to say like we're not talking about like next quarter. It's probably in the order of -- anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million cars a year."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I'd probably see a path to like 7,000 units with Model 3 with really minimal CapEx. We would need to at least bring lines down in Fremont for significant upgrades to get to 10k. But also just not -- we're not talking about massive amount of CapEx, but long term, it's at least sort of7,000 to 10,000 cars."

"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We've made significant progress on the Model Y. We'll also start going into volume production of the solar tile roof next year. And then we've got continued improvements in Powerwall, Powerpack, other energy products. I think we have the most exciting product road map of any company by far."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: The top reason to refer a friend to buy a Tesla is it's going to keep your friend safe. We do not intend to raise equity or debt. At least that's our intention right now. The current operating plan is to pay our debts and refinance them and reduce the debt load and leverage."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We need to get to a point where we can sell a $35,000 car and where the full accountable COGS of the car is, let's say, on the order of $30,000. That would be our goal. That's what we're pushing very hard to achieve."
"summary_text": "The time to get the car from a factory to a customer was 30 days, down to 20 at the end of the quarter. Where do we see that flow through from a COGS perspective? Is that in automotive gross margin? Or is that in services and other at this point?Deepak AhujaTESLA, INC. FQ3 2018 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2018."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We don't expect this to result in -- I mean, the sales tax -- or the tax incentive in the U.S. drops in half in this quarter. And we certainly do not expect anything that would cause our production to drop below a minimum of 5,000 cars a week."
