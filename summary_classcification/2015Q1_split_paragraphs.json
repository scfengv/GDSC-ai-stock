So when it's low volume made in Fremont, it will be relatively low margin. Once we get to Gigafactory up and running and -- high volume and get the economies of scale working, this is just a guess right now, but I mean like maybe it's somewhere around 20%.

One is backup power or peaker -- sort of the equivalent -- on a utility scale of like a peaker plant, which is a high-energy application. And then there's the daily cycler application. There are different chemistries depending upon which one you have. So the backup power chemistry is quite similar to the car, which is like a nickel cobalt aluminum cathode.

Like if you can imagine, like the highest-energy day in California on like a hot summer day where there's a heat wave, the energy consumption there is very high compared to a pleasant spring night, where nobody's air conditioning or heating is on or for very little and like commerce is not happening and people are asleep and lights are off.

Brian Arthur Johnson Barclays PLC, Research Division And you mentioned last time that some CapEx was going to product development, in the shareholders' letter, for Model 3 -- Model 3 wasn't in this. Does that mean you might be delaying some Model 3 investments? Or just the other things kind of swamp it? Elon R.

We need to make sure -- we're doing quite a bit of advanced work on Model 3, but this just doesn't amount to a lot of CapEx.

FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nI have a 2-part question on cash. Firstly, on the last call, you mentioned reaching free cash flow positive\nin 4Q this year. I'm just wondering, with 1Q behind you, how you think you're tracking relative to that\ngoal? And then secondly, if you could perhaps comment on your capitalization and liquidity overall and the\npotential for, or desirability of, raising any additional capital.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nWe do expect to be free cash flow positive in Q4, that doesn't change. And as we go along, clearly, we are\noptimizing for efficiency, which results in increase of our finished goods inventory. It makes sense for us\nto then establish some asset pipelines of credit, which is backed by our finished goods inventory or raw\nmaterials. So we'll take those actions to make sure we have a solid balance sheet.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, I mean I think it's -- yes, I think things are looking pretty good for Q4. But it's hard to predict full\nquarter exactly because the whole quarterly boundary and where does the sort of the sort of exponential\nramp of production fall exactly on that start of Q4 boundary. But it's -- I think it's extremely likely that\nthere's -- that cash flow is really good at the end of Q4."

First is regarding the residences which may not have the solar panels,\nand, say, that residence goes and buys 2 power walls. Does that customer have to buy 2 inverters or 1\ninverter is sufficient for as many power walls the customer buys?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nIt's basically whatever the capability of that inverter is. So typically the inverter would be capable of\nhandling -- 1 inverter is probably capable of handling, depending on the situation, up to maybe 4 or 5\npower walls.\nTrip Chowdhry\nGlobal Equities Research, LLC\nThe second question I had was regarding the double-back tour you had in 10 cities, and that was -- our\nresearch indicated that it was a very successful event with the reservations and orders really skyrocketing.\nAnd I think it was only in Canada and U.S.A. Wondering if you could expand that tour to other continents?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, absolutely. I mean, we have actually -- we just did a big thing in Europe through Germany. And there\nactually, I think, there is like quite a big a tour happening from Slovenia, I think, through most of Europe.\nSo there's actually quite a lot happening. Actually, our sales in Europe lately have been pretty, pretty\ngreat. I mean, like, yes, really strong.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd we did the tour in Germany, too -- in Europe, too, sorry, with your motor.\nElon R.

So the 85D has been a big hit in Europe.\nTrip Chowdhry\nGlobal Equities Research, LLC\nIf I can ask one last question. I was at your Lathrop factory the other day. And there was some interesting\nconstruction happening behind it, with huge metallic frames being installed. What kind of production could\nbe happening there? And it seems like the factory size has increased almost 40%. And what is happening\nthere? Any thoughts you can share with us? And that's all for me.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, we're establishing a big casting foundry and machining facility there. And yes, that's intended to\nsupport activity in Fremont. So that's -- yes, that's what's happening in Lathrop primarily."

Patrick Kenehan Archambault Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Just wanted to build on, I think, Ryan Brinkman's question, on the fourth quarter cash flow guidance. Does that include income from those warehouse facilities to offset leased vehicles? Or is that exclusive of that? Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer Well, our projection, as Elon said, was the end of the quarter, as we ramp up production, we should be free cash flow positive on a pure sense. But frankly, our operations should be looked at without the impact of leasing. And that's a purer measure of operations, which is a lower threshold, I get it, but that's a unique or distinct decision we've made to be in that business. Jeff Evanson Vice President of Investor Relations Hold on a second, Pat. Deepak, do you want to explain about the classification of cash inflows within the statement of cash flows? Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer Sure. Yes, if you look at our Q1 cash flows, for example, we received $155 million from our, either the warehouse line or banking partners related to our leasing business. But that cash flow does not show up as an offset in our cash flow from operations. It shows up in our financing activities. So our cash flow from operations shows up $131 million negative. But if you offset that against the $155 million that we received on the leasing business,"

        "paragraph": "we were slightly better than breakeven purely on an operations basis. And so our real cash flow in Q1 was driven by the strong CapEx spend ahead of the Model X launches, the way we tend to look at the business internally. Patrick Kenehan Archambault Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay, I appreciate that clarification. The other quick question I had is just I was a little surprised by the -- I think you guys had obviously very good gross margins this quarter relative to some of the headwinds that you were facing. And I guess I was surprised to see that x ZEV, they go from 26 to 25. With some of the increases in pricing that you're putting through and some of the components that you're buying outside of the U.S. with a stronger dollar now, which -- where there was a little bit of a lag, I understand. I -- it just -- that seemed a bit conservative, and I don't know, maybe it ties back into Rod's earlier point about mix, but I guess that was one area that I was a little surprised.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL MAY 06, 2015 Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer So just to clarify, the price increase that we've announced is not going to help us in Q2 given our book of business. It's going to primarily affect us in Q3. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect Yes. Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer"

        "paragraph": "And also in April, for most of April, the dollar was pretty strong. It's just trended in the last week or 10 days or so, and we were continuing to deliver cars. So that strong dollar impact does roll over sequentially into Q2 for us despite the lag effect of good news from a strong dollar. And as we said in the letter, we fully expect the mix impact to be offset by cost reductions that we will achieve. So it's really related to FX that we see the sequential drop. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect Yes. The FX was really -- that was really a tricky thing to deal with. We had a quite strong European sales. And then the FX impact was quite significant. So obviously, if you've got a car that is, like let's say, 25% gross margin, and you've got -- and you see a 20% change in currency, it's like, wow, okay? That's not super easy to make up that difference. Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer Yes. And to your point, and maybe this is a broader comment to make, that as we look at our Q1 non- GAAP loss that we have of $45 million, a big chunk or most of it could be attributed to the dollar strength that has happened over the last 6 months. As we've indicated, our Q1 top line came down by about 3 percentage points. And then we had the $22 million"

Erickson\nPacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division\nJust a quick follow-up from the last one on the automotive gross margins. I think just x currency, can you\njust quickly talk maybe a couple of examples where you're looking to remove more costs from the car\nitself? I think we can all kind of appreciate there's continued scale advantages over time. But maybe if you\ncould talk about other cost savings opportunities we should be thinking about with both the S and the X,\nand sort of what inning we're in, in terms of achieving those savings?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, a big factor is labor hours per vehicle. That has steadily improved. It was sort of quite bad in Q4,\nparticularly with the P85 ramp, P85D ramp. We've made good progress on that in Q1, we'll continue to\nmake good progress on that through the rest of the year. So it's like labor and like direct overhead in the\nfactory.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, we're focused across every line item of our COGS, so material cost reductions, freight, both inbound\n-- we spoke a little bit about outbound freight efficiencies...\nElon R.

Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nBecause you know there was that big port strike was super-unhelpful. That also hurt pretty badly. It was\nlike the, I think, the worst port strike of the 21st century. And so we're also soldiering through that.

Incorporated, Research Division This is Ben, very quickly, you mentioned the Gigafactory and then a lot of talk about stationary storage and increasing the size of the Gigafactory. Does that change in any way that you're looking at partnerships and bringing partnerships in, and maybe an update on timing there? And then, Elon, you talked about having a fleet of a couple hundred X to get out and test. And you mentioned Model 3 showing it next March. When should we see the Model X in it's final version? Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer Well, no particular change to the partnership model for the Gigafactory. I think as Elon said, it's early days on trying to make some of those changes in direction. But largely, it's just a bigger scope of opportunity for a lot of the people we're already working with. And it is continuing to go well. We're actually beginning to hire operational people at the Gigafactory and beginning to staff up on that ahead of -- starting to train and then ramp up production of the stationary products early next year.
