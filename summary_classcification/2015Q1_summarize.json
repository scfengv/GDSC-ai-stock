        "paragraph": "Instructions] Our first phone question will come from the line of Dan Galves with\nCr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nDaniel Galves\nCr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\nSo if you -- if we assume Model S volume of 50,000 in 2015, deliveries need to average over 14,000 per\nquarter in Q3 and Q4. What's the biggest challenge to get there? And do you have order rates today that\nsupport that level of volume in the back half?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nSure. So yes, I mean, that's about right. I mean, obviously, with the Model X production ramping up\nquite heavily in Q4, depending upon how that ramp goes -- and obviously, it's difficult to predict that with\nperfect clarity. But the -- our volume essentially doubles in Q4. So depending upon how the ramp goes,\nI do want to emphasize that -- sorry, what sometimes people don't totally appreciate is that there are\nseveral thousand unique parts in the car. And if even one of those parts is not available for any reason,\nthen you cannot ship, you cannot scale production. So -- and so it's essentially the production ramp goes\naccording to the unluckiest and worst-performing supplier or part of Tesla. But that said, we do expect\nto see a significant ramp in Q4 for the X and have something that may be as much as 2x other quarters\nin Q4. And as far as the demand for that, we do not see that being a problem. There are huge advanced\norders for the X, and we see a steady climb in demand for the S.\nDaniel Galves\nCr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\nOkay, got it. And just as a follow-up, you've improved the Model S a whole lot in the last couple of\nyears. Does that make it easier to launch Model X at a high quality level? And does it allow you to move\nengineering and design resources towards Model 3 faster than you moved resources to Model X?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. In the case of the X, the X ended up having a lot -- being a lot more different than the S than we\noriginally anticipated. So the development took a lot longer, and we were distracted solving all sort of\nissues with the S during that time, which made it difficult for us to allocate engineering resources to the\nX when there were issues to be solved with the S. So I think we'll do a lot better with the X and we're\npaying close attention to some of the things that are different about the X to make sure that they're not\nan issue, particularly the Falcon Wing door and the second row seats. And yes, so I'm feeling pretty good\nabout things. But because that production ramp just scales exponentially, depending upon where that\nexponential curve falls across a quarterly boundary, it can actually make quite significant -- make quite\na significant effect on the production and deliveries in that quarter. So that's why it's like -- it's easy --\nit's a lot easier to predict it sort of continuous than if it's discrete with offshore [ph] quarterly cut-offs.\nBut I really think the X is going to be -- it's really going to be a great car. I just drove the latest prototype\ntoday, and it's like, wow, this is by far the best SUV.",

FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nFirst question is, do you guys earn 4 or 9 ZEV credits per vehicle? And how many vehicles are participating\nin your battery swap beta program?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nThe amount of credits, ZEV credits, we earn depends on the size of the pack, different for what we're\ndoing for the 60 versus 85, and now the new ones at 70. That has been varying over time, the amount of\nZEV credits we earn. So I'll need to confirm that before I give the official number here.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nThe ZEV credits thing, it's not like -- I mean, it sort of moves things by like 2%. It's like not super\nmaterial. So I'm not sure what the point of your question is.\nJohn Lovallo\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nWell, yes, here's the point of the question is that assuming you guys sell 10,000 vehicles in ZEV states this\nyear, that would mean that you would need 400 programs -- sorry, 400 vehicles involved in this battery\nswap program if you assume that each of them swapped 25x each, so a minimum of 400 vehicles. So I'm\ncurious if there are 400 vehicles involved in the battery swap program.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, I mean, you do realize like ZEV credits don't sell for 100 cents on the dollar. They sell for like $0.50\nor sometimes less. And there are not always customers for the ZEV credits.\nJohn Lovallo\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nYes, I'm just asking about what you guys are actually earning per vehicle. Okay, and I guess the next...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nIt's not a big deal, yes. And as more of our production goes overseas, obviously, there's no ZEV states\noverseas. And as our sales increase outside of California or Canada, those are not ZEV states. So this is\nlike -- the ZEV stuff is like an increasingly small part of the picture over time.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nWe have hundreds vehicles in the battery swap pilot program.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nIt's not like 10 or something like that. It's hundreds of vehicles.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. We've steadily increased the invitation list. We've just found like it's -- there just is not a lot of\ninterest in people doing pack swap. So we make the invitations, and we get a very small percentage that\nactually take us up on the invitation.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nJohn Lovallo\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nRight. The only point is there's a difference of 5 ZEV credits per vehicle. That was the only point. My\nsecond question would be, my the final question, there is some news report saying that SolarCity has\nsaid that they're not going to use the 7 kilowatt hour battery. In fact, I think there was a quote from a\nspokesman -- whether it's true or not, we don't know -- saying that it doesn't make economic sense. I\nmean, can you guys comment on that, please?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. I mean let me just sort of talk more broadly about the response to the power wall and power\npack because I don't think that's the really the question you should be asking. But the response has\nbeen overwhelming, okay, like crazy. The -- In the course of like less than a week, we've had 38,000\nreservations for the power wall, 2,500 reservations for the power pack. The power pack, it should be\nnoted, typically this is bought by utilities or large industrial companies for heavy industrial work. So\ntypically, power pack it's like at least 10 power packs per installation. So if there's 2,500 reservations,\nit's actually 25,000 power packs. Power wall also is -- we suspect is probably an -- average of number of\npower packs is probably 1.5 to 2 per installation. So 38,000 reservations is more like 50,000 or 60,000\nactual power walls. So I mean, there's like no way that we could possibly satisfy this demand this year.\nAnd we're basically like sold out through the middle of next year in the first week. It was just crazy. We\nhad 2,500 requests from companies that want to distribute and install the power wall and power pack.\nWe can't even respond to them. This is -- we have to like triage our response to those who want to be a\ndistributor. So it's like crazy off the hook, yes. And it's just -- it seems to have gone super viral. For the\nspecific case of SolarCity, what they're referring to is that there's 2 versions of the pack -- of the power\nwall. There's the daily cycling version and there's the power backup version. One's energies optimized and\none's daily cycling optimized. So the daily cycling optimized one, the economics, it is true in the U.S. with\nrare exception, are more expensive than utility. So if somebody wants to do a daily cycling basically go\noff grid. It's going to be more expensive than being on grid. This doesn't mean that people won't buy it\nbecause there are people who want to go off grid on principle, or they just want to be independent. And\nthat's what the SolarCity comment is about.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nIt might also be worth noting that SolarCity doesn't yet operate in Europe. the main target application\nfor the daily cycling battery pack was actually -- were several markets not in the continental U.S. And\nparticularly, Germany and Australia are very strong markets where it does make economic sense today\nbased on the feed-in tariff and the electricity rate structures in those countries. So SolarCity's comments, I\nthink, need to be put in the regional context.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. SolarCity is only operating in the U.S. And the power wall, it will be available from SolarCity and from\nother installers in both configurations. But if someone is doing a daily cycling application, they're doing it\nout of -- because they specifically want grid independence. And there's some number of people who will\nwant to do that, and that's good. And it's also important to appreciate like even to say the power backup\nsystems, so that you always have power in the event of a power outage, if -- like let's say that appeals\nto like 2% of households in the U.S. or 1%. Let's say 1%, that's 1 million households. Like is there one\nperson in 100 care about having battery backup in the event of utility outage? Probably. We couldn't even\nsupport a small fraction of that, so -- right now, so it's kind of a moot point.",

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Andrea James with Dougherty and Company.\nAndrea Susan JamesTESLA, INC. FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nDougherty & Company LLC, Research Division\nJust to build on the Tesla Energy conversation, what are your revenue and gross margin targets on that\nbusiness? And how do we look at the 2015 ramp?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, I mean, the gross margin revenue obviously is going to change with time. So when it's low volume\nmade in Fremont, it will be relatively low margin. Once we get to Gigafactory up and running and -- high\nvolume and get the economies of scale working, this is just a guess right now, but I mean like maybe it's\nsomewhere around 20%. It's not like -- it's like we just don't have enough information to say exactly that\nwould be, but probably 20% is a reasonable guess. And then in terms of volume, I mean, we're going to\ntry to scale it as fast as we can -- as the slowest manufacturing constraint. So I mean, it's easier to say\nwhat's the long term without saying like exactly which quarters it's going to be, and I don't know. But I\nthink we'll see demand for stationary storage as measured in sort of megawatt hours or gigawatts hours\nto be approximately double that of the car. That's our best guess for long-term demand yet.\nAndrea Susan James\nDougherty & Company LLC, Research Division\nHow do you think about your capacity or even your cost per kilowatt hour? Because it's different than a\ncar, right? The duty load is way different for a stationary storage application. So can you educate us a little\nbit on how we look at analyzing that business and the difference between that and the energy needs of\nthe car business per pack?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, there's 2 applications which are quite different. One is backup power or peaker -- sort of the\nequivalent -- on a utility scale of like a peaker plant, which is a high-energy application. And then there's\nthe daily cycler application. There are different chemistries depending upon which one you have. So the\nbackup power chemistry is quite similar to the car, which is like a nickel cobalt aluminum cathode. The\ndaily cycling control [ph] constituent is nickel manganese cobalt, so there's quite a lot of manganese\nin there. And there's just one's meant for, call it maybe 60 or 70 cycles per year. And the other one is\nmeant for daily cycling -- daily deep cycling, so it's 365 cycles a year. And the daily cycler one, I mean, we\nexpected to be able to daily cycle for something on the order of 15 years. Obviously,, the warranty period\nwould be a little bit less than that, but we expect it to be something that's in the kind of 5,000 cycle-\nrange capability, whereas the high-energy pack is more like around the -- maybe depending on how it's\nused, anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 cycles. And they have comparable calendar lives. And yes, so that's\n-- now for the high-energy one, it's important to appreciate that this is actually -- has a lot of interest\nfrom utilities, because utilities have to maintain these things called peaker plants and for like when there's\nlike a sharp increase in usage. Like if you can imagine, like the highest-energy day in California on like\na hot summer day where there's a heat wave, the energy consumption there is very high compared to a\npleasant spring night, where nobody's air conditioning or heating is on or for very little and like commerce\nis not happening and people are asleep and lights are off. That can be a huge delta. Depending upon the\nsituation, it can be anywhere from like a 5 to 10x difference. So then having a battery pack that can take\nout those like very sort of weird sharp peaks like the heat wave day. You could either have a battery pack\nwhich requires basically no maintenance and doesn't require any fuel, and it's going peak shave those\nreally troublesome days. Or you could have like a power plant that requires fuel and maintenance, and it's\ngot to be -- it's always got to be maintained at it's-- it takes time -- it's not -- you can't just start it up in 3\nseconds like it -- you've got have notice. The high-energy pack is actually very economically competitive in\nthose sort of situations. And then the high cycling pack is really great for -- if you've got some sort of wind\nor solar situation, that's where the high cycling one is really great on the utility scale. I should say like the\n-- we expect most of our stationary storage sales to be at the utility or heavy industrial scale. It's probably\n-- again, just a guess because it's early days, 5 to 10x more megawatt hours will be deployed at the utility\nand heavy industrial scale than at the consumer scale. So the power pack would be the one that's like theTESLA, INC. FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nheavy duty, the big production sales one, not so much the power wall. The power wall is great, but it's\nprobably only 10% to 20% the size of the power pack demand.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nMaybe one point on the cost structure. There's definitely a lot of commonality in the supply chain and even\nin the manufacturing base on how we do the modules themselves for the Tesla Energy products, along\nwith the vehicle products. So as we ramp up production on the Tesla Energy products, there definitely are\nbenefits to the vehicle costs of energy storage from scale and from just generally moving more material\nand kilowatt hours through that whole chain. So both businesses benefit each other.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. I mean, clearly given the very high demand that we're seeing for Tesla Energy products, we're\nactually trying to figure out if we can go from like our current production target of like 35 gigawatt\nhours at cell level and 50 at the pack level in our Nevada plant to maybe 50% more than that or even\nhigher because just the sheer volume of demand here is just staggering. We could easily have the entire\nGigafactory just do stationary storage.\nAndrea Susan James\nDougherty & Company LLC, Research Division\nRight. So you have some capacity. I think you said maybe 15% of your capacity might be reserved for\nstationary storage. Maybe I've read that in an article somewhere, I'm not sure.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\n15 gigawatt hours or 1/3 of the 50 gigawatts hours that's targeted at the pack level, so 15% at the 15\ngigawatt hours or roughly 30%.\nAndrea Susan James\nDougherty & Company LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And you might add now maybe -- you're looking at doing another 50%, In growing the capacity\n50%, and you have the space, I guess there in Nevada to do that?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWe do. I don't want to make that a prediction. But that seems like the thing that we should do, so we're\ninvestigating that. It seems like the logical thing to do, so we're going to probably try to do that, yes.\nBecause we're fairly confident at this point, that the entire Gigafactory output could just do stationary\nstorage. It's like wow, okay, we need to make cars, too. So we should try to make the factory bigger.\nThat's like the total logic. It's not more complicated than that.\nAndrea Susan James\nDougherty & Company LLC, Research Division\nBut given the choice between making -- sorry, but given the choice between making a pack for a car and\nmaking a pack for a stationary storage application, how do you pick which one gets the priority?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, I guess we'd pick cars because we got this whole other plant here in Fremont making cars. So cars\nwould get the priority, yes. That would be the logical priority. And yes, but I mean, it really feels like, man,\nthe stationary storage demand is just nutty like worldwide, it's just crazy.\nJeff EvansonTESLA, INC. FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nVice President of Investor Relations\nHuey, we actually have a question e-mailed in from one of the analysts that is out of the country, so I'll\nread that -- those next. And it will start with the energy storage questions.\nSo guys, do our years in R&D work in vehicle batteries contribute benefits into this Tesla Energy business?\nWhere have we've drawn some learnings from the vehicle business for Tesla Energy?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWe've learned a lot about battery packs, I mean obviously, how to make them, and have them last for a\nlong time, and work in high temperature ranges and that kind of thing. I think there are a few points of\nclarification that should be made with -- regarding the power wall because a lot of people are confused\nabout the whole inverter issue. So there's -- the power wall does include a DC to DC inverter. And that\ncan interface directly with a solar panel installation. And if somebody has a solar panel installation, they\nalready will have a DC to AC inverter for the solar power system. And so no incremental DC to AC inverter\nis needed. Like in some of the analysis we've seen online by people who think they are experts, they don't\nseem to realize that there is a DC to DC inverter, and we haven't been, I guess, quite clear about that,\nwhich we need to be. But like if you already have a solar installation, or you're going to get one, the DC\nto AC inverter is already there. That's an important point concerning the cost of the system. And then the\noperating temperature, it's actually capable of operating at a much wider band of temperature. So we've\ngot to fix that specification that's stated on the website.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nIn general, most of the learnings from the car R&D and engineering carry over. I mean part of why we can\ndo this so quickly and...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nAnywhere the car works, the pack will work. And the car works pretty much everywhere. So -- in fact it\ndoes work everywhere, so the pack will work everywhere, obviously.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nIf anything, it's quite over-engineered for a battery pack that doesn't have to move. It gets mounted on\nyour wall. So I think that's going to be a great benefit for reliability and just longevity of the pack.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nAnd one for Deepak. Would you be willing to provide any breakdown of the capital -- the CapEx spending\nin Q1?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nThe CapEx spending was primarily driven by the capacity expansion that we're doing for Model X,\nincluding the tooling spend. And then, of course, we are putting in the new paint shop, which is a very\nsignificant investment. That will be ready in Q3. And then we have also had investments in the Gigafactory\nand our sales and service network. That's probably the order in which we've been spending.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nGreat. Thank you.",

FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nNext question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nI guess first question is staying on the stationary storage topic. I mean, how do you view the -- you\nmentioned there's 2 different chemistries. How does that work with the Gigafactory? Does that require all\nseparate lines? Is there any more complexities or all within the same facility? And how do you view your\nchemistries versus other competitive options out there? There are other people who are bullish on things\nlike zinc and other more basic chemistry?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nWell, they could still be both be built in the Gigafactory. It doesn't -- we have multiple lines operating in\nthe Gigafactory, so if one line is building nickel cobalt aluminum chemistry and another is building nickel\nmanganese cobalt, that still works just fine. A lot of the cell assembly and then the processes that happen\nafter that are almost identical.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, I mean, they look the same at the module and pack level. You can't really tell by just looking at them.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nIt's just kind of the internal chemical constituents. I mean you can think of like the -- sort of breakdown\nthe problem like -- the cell is a chemical engineering problem. It's like a little can of chemicals. And then\nthe module and pack problem is a mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering\nproblem. And if you have just like a small number of cells, then as an overall engineering problem, it's\nlike mostly about the cell. But once you get -- have a lot of cells, then it's -- then the intellectual property\nchallenge, the intellectual challenge becomes more at the mechanical, electrical and software level, which\nis where Tesla does quite well. That's why you don't really see -- like nobody else has like -- has a pack\nlike ours. There -- the cells are relatively generic, but the module and pack is not.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. And we've looked at pretty much every chemistry couple that could possibly be relevant for this.\nWe're confident what we're using is going to be the best. But if there's something better, we can also\nadjust and change over time. So there's a lot of flexibility.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, I mean I'm not sure if like the exact -- the right analogy would be, but like if you had like a laptop\nand it's like you could say, \"Whoa, a laptop's really just like Intel CPU and some Micron DRAM chips.\" Like,\nbig deal. What's any computer company actually doing? They're doing a lot.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nSo what do you view your competitive edge? So it sounds like you think it's the software and electronic\nintegration, the competitive advantage? Because in your presentation, you actually mentioned you\nencourage other companies that build -- to enter the market as well.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. And I think we are -- in terms of the electrical engineering, the mechanical, the software and the\noverall aesthetics and just having something that really just works and is easy for consumers and utilities\nand large industrial applications to just order and it just works, and it's just there as a fully integrated\nsystem. That's what's the value that Tesla is adding.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nI think there's also a substantial benefit to the track record of the automotive fleet. That's something that\na lot of the sort of newer start-up companies or different technologies in the space really struggled with,\nespecially in the utility application, where you need to be sure that it's going to work for 15-plus years.\nAnd we have a sense of scale and have a great track record on the vehicle fleet that you can really pull\nfrom data -- and pull data from and understand how it's going to work.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI shouldn't say like we're like wedded to a particular chemistry or anything like that. We just want to use\nthe best chemistry. Like whatever little can that contains a cathode, an anode, a separator and electrolyte,\nwhatever that -- the best constituents of that can are -- that's what we will want to use. So we'd love it\nif somebody could come up with a better internal chemistry for the cell. But it's worth noting like nobody\nhas sent us anything, a sample cell, that's better than the cell we're producing. So -- or that -- something\nthat we will produce in the Gigafactory. So we'd love it if somebody would do that. They just haven't.\nAnd so it's like all these things which are big on promise and short on delivery when it comes to battery\nchemistry. And it's just a real hard problem. And then hardly a week goes by that there's not some alleged\nbreakthrough in batteries. But what they'll do is they'll cite the power, but not the energy. Or they'll forget\nto mention that it will only last 50 cycles or uses incredibly exotic raw materials...\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nOr one component out of the battery pulled separately.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, exactly. It's just not like a -- it's not the full picture. So it's not like we don't want a better chemistry\nto exist than what we're using. We'd love it if there was such a thing. And I'm sure there will be\nimprovements over time, and we'll implement them as soon as they are remotely production-ready.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nJust one last final of question. Any color on the -- on a financial question, other expenses is up quite a bit.\nIt was $22.3 million, What was really just driving that in the quarter?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, that was essentially revaluation of primarily our foreign currencies that we had at the end of the\nquarter. The dollar was particularly strong against foreign currencies there, and it's also, in most cases,\nunrealized losses.

FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nOkay. So we should kind of consider most of it as onetime in nature because of FX, balance sheet effect\n[ph]?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, they're not related directly to operations. It's simply the revaluation of our currencies into company's\nitems.",

        "paragraph": "Next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nA couple questions on stationary storage first. One is it seems like utilities move quite a bit slower than\nother markets. So I was wondering when you are thinking about the expectations for the trajectory of\ngrowth, if you had the capacity today, how long would do you think it would take for you to get to that\n15 gigawatt hours? Also related to this business, it seems like you're using third parties for most of the\ndistribution, installation. So if you achieved maybe a 20% gross margin, can you pass along any thoughts\non how we should we be thinking in terms of SG&A is allocated?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI think it's pretty early days to -- I mean, we're being super-speculative at this point. So it's...\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. Maybe one point on the distributors. We're only focusing on that approach for power wall in most case\n-- in most cases. So with utilities, we're building those relationships directly. That's not something that\nis really effective to go through a distribution channel, and it's something we have also been doing for a\nnumber of years. It didn't just start last Thursday. And we've built these relationships partially through\nvehicle infrastructure and charging questions and back and forth, supercharging as well. So there's\nactually quite a lot of trust built between Tesla and many of the utility companies, which is very helpful to\ngrow that business faster.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nAnd just a clarification on the comment about the fact that a DC/AC inverter is already there for solar.\nDoes the fact that it needs be bidirectional change the nature of the cost? Or not really?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nNo, not in most cases because if you have already solar, typically, the energy to charge the battery can\ncome from the solar panel. So I think maybe one way to think of it is, if the battery pack, the power wall,\nwith its internal DC to DC converter, can act much like a solar panel. It can match voltage with the solar\npanel array and it can feed power back into that. So the existing inverter doesn't particularly see a big\nchange.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nOkay, got it. On the auto business, do you have any preliminary expectations on the mix of the 70D\nversus 85? Any thoughts on how that affects margins? And lastly, a question for Deepak. In the past,\nwe were able to look at your supplemental information on leasing where you disclose the value of the\nleases delivered and the value that you're booking this at on the balance sheet, which is presumably yourTESLA, INC. FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\ncost. And it sort of approximated your gross margins, but this quarter, when you do the math, the implied\nmargins were something like 44%, not like 29%, 30%. Is there something unusual there?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nI'll answer the second one. No, there's nothing unusual in those numbers as the overall. What you're\nseeing in the supplemental information is the new cars we've delivered. What's coming through ultimately\nis the cumulative impact of all the leasing that we have done. But to my knowledge, there's nothing else\nunusual.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nOkay. It seems like a pretty high margin, though, when you look at it that way. Anything on the mix, 70D\nversus 85?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI mean, it's still pretty early to be predicting mix because you have to distinguish between what's sort of\ninitial demand versus sustained demand. So I mean, it looks like there may be -- going to be comparable\nnumber of 70s versus 85s. But it's -- this is difficult to -- this is extrapolating on very little information.\nAnd yes, I think a key point I should make before this call ends is we're really optimizing, at this point\ngoing forward, we're going to be optimizing for the operational efficiency of the company as opposed to\nspecific quarters. This is -- I feel like what we've done in the past, where we've really had to scramble at\nthe end of quarters and sometimes have not a great customer experience at the end of quarters. It's not\nreally the right thing for the company. And so we're going to be operating more for sort of steady-state\nefficiency. And that means the quarterly fluctuations could be a little higher, but in the long term, it will be\nbetter. So that's an important consideration. Also sort of unlike other car companies, Tesla sales are only\nrecognized when they arrive at the end customer and we've received payment and all the regulatory docs\nhave been processed and all that. So our sales are always kind of true -- they're always true sales. They're\nnot sales to the channel. Whereas the other car companies are -- they're sales to the channel. So it's\npossible to sort of -- for them to make numbers work, where they're selling to their channel as opposed to\nend customers. In our case, it's always end customers. And -- as we're shipping to Asia and Europe and\nacross the U.S., it's fairly easy for there to be a plus/minus 5% difference in deliveries just due to logistics\nissues. So it's not a huge variation, plus/minus 5%, but that's kind of like the -- if a ship is late or early,\nit can affect the -- there could be 500 cars that are affected, and then that's 5%, so -- which we've seen\nin the past. So that's an important thing to bear in mind. The number that's much more controllable for\nus is the production number. So that's -- our production predictions, I think, are, for the vehicles, are -- at\nleast for the Model S, not so much for a new vehicle but for an existing vehicle, our production predictions\nare a lot more controllable. And then, as I think people have similar drives [ph], demand is different from\nproduction. Like there's -- our cars are almost all ordered in advance. So we really don't see any demand\nissue, but you can sort of see that by the delivery times of the cars on our website. So it's like sometimes\npeople will interpret a quarterly delivery number as somehow being related to demand. This is not the\ncase. This is usually related to like just that's how many -- we produced a certain number, and then we\nwere able to deliver a certain number in the quarter, and so -- and there's so much cars on ships or on\ntrains or on trucks. And so that's -- because Tesla is different from other car companies, applying the\nother car companies' template can lead to incorrect conclusions about Tesla. Is this making sense, I mean,\nor [indiscernible]?\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nYes, it makes sense.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectTESLA, INC. FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nOkay.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, and to add to what Elon said, to be more efficient operationally, we are shipping more by train\nrather than trucks. It's more cost efficient and creates less damage to the car, gives a better customer\nexperience. So we are taking all these actions.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nI guess my question is more geared to trying to assess the effect on ASPs and margins as you're changing\nthe mix a little bit. But I appreciate that.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, I -- to sort of answer your question on margins, I think there's 2 things that are happening. The\naverage sales price is going to decline a little bit, but the -- but our costs are improving as well. So -- and\nwe see that more or less netting out, so that efficiency improvements offset approximately any average\nselling price change.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd if in the process we are growing the market, which we truly are by hitting the right sweet spot,\nthen we are doing the right thing with the 70D. And the 70D has a higher gross margin than the 60,\nfor example. And 60 was just not hitting the market. It just didn't have the right attributes that our\ncustomers like. It was a low take rate. And we've got a product which is far more compelling and much\nmore competitive with other cars.",

        "paragraph": "Our next phone question will come from the line of Colin Rusch with Northland Capital Markets.\nColin William Rusch\nNorthland Capital Markets, Research Division\nAs you look at the growth of the organization, the integrity of the culture and the workforce, I know that\nyour employees are extremely motivated. But could you talk about, as you grow, how that's growing and\nchanging and what you're doing to maintain that integrity as we go forward?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI mean, it is tricky, as companies grow, to maintain a consistent culture. I think we're doing okay. I think\nas measured, yes, relative to most companies. But we do need to get people to think differently and have\nan expectation of innovation. And I mean, I think we're doing okay on that front.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes, I think having a general mix of people that have been here for a very long time and have seen\nmultiple programs and seen the company when it was even much smaller than today and more scrappy\nand had to go through even tighter financial difficult launches, things like that, really helps maintain that\nculture. And we try and pair different managers up with new groups so that, that culture sort of infuses\nthroughout.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectTESLA, INC. FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nYes. And our growth rate, like this year, personnel-wise is sort of, I won't say leveled off, because it's still\nfairly significant, but it's like our net personnel growth this year will probably be 20% to 30%, which is I\nthink a manageable number for kind of integrating with people that already have kind of the Tesla culture.\nAnd I think it's also -- it's a pretty big improvement in productivity. Because we're looking at, let's call it,\nlike if it's up at the upper end of that 30% personnel increase, but 100% increase in vehicle volume. So I\nthink that's a pretty good indicator of productivity improvements, just like how many people do we have\nand how many cars are we making.\nColin William Rusch\nNorthland Capital Markets, Research Division\nGood. And the second question is really around some of the choices that you made with the battery\nproduct and why choosing 10 kW and the size. 220 pound is actually pretty hefty for a garage wall. And\nthen also the battery management system. I think there's a lot of confusion around where it's located\nand what the real functionality is, as you look at it interfacing with utilities and the signals that you get\nfrom the market, in terms of looking at demand trying to offset demand response and some of the other\nadvanced functionalities that are going to be able to be monetized in business models with the product.\nCan you just clarify where that BMS system is, where it resides and who owns that technology, and why\nyou guys made those choices along with the weight and size choices?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nSome of the different revenue streams you're talking about are kind of mixed between power pack and\npower wall. The BMS system lives inside the battery pack in both cases. But with the power pack, in\nthe more utility-sized installations, there, we often will have sort of a site master computer or master\ncontroller that controls multiple power packs. And that site controller is what then interfaces to the\nutility or maybe a commercial customer to sort of run the scheduled charge and discharge that would\nbe appropriate for a given application. On the power wall, it's a bit of a different situation. Still, the BMS\nlives inside the battery pack. But in some cases, the inverter may be the system that's deciding how to\nmanage energy in the overall house, and that can depend on which type of inverter we're using and how\nthat works. And in terms of the size, we really -- for power wall again, we optimized the size around what\nwas the most common photovoltaic size and also what we felt was kind of the smallest modular increment\nfor backup. And it's pretty key to note here that you can install multiple power walls together. So having\n10 kilowatt hours doesn't mean that you can't very easily put in 20 or 30 or 40. And in many cases, I\nthink people will, to have the backup kind of matching that they want to see. But we felt 10 kilowatt hours\nwas the lowest kind of common element. And if you go smaller than that, you start to run into worse\neconomies of scale and more the system that's not related to storage.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nHuey, before we go to the next question, I just wanted to give everybody a status update. A lot of\nimportant things to talk about on this call, but we-are 50 minutes into the call and we still have 7 callers in\nqueue. So just let you guys think about how we manage time here.",

        "paragraph": "Our next phone question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nFirst question, on the Model S and the release candidates. How many release candidates have you\nproduced? What have been some of the issues with the recent production? And why the slight -- am I\nseeing a slight further delay by [indiscernible] late 3Q from what I thought was kind of more of an August\ntime horizon for initial deliveries? Anything that kind of might be behind that you'd highlight?\nElon R. MuskTESLA, INC. FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI think we're past almost sort of answering super-detailed questions about the X ramp. But look, the thing\nthat really matters is not like when do the first deliveries of the X occur, but rather when do significant\ndeliveries of the X occur. And for the S, we had quite a long ramp from -- we had like 6 months from\nthe very first deliveries to significant volume. We're trying to compress that to maybe like 2 months\nor 3 months for -- at most, cut that in half or more for the X. And we want to make sure we really are\ndelivering a product that has been thoroughly validated in hot and cold weather and through millions of\nmiles of travel and everything. So it would be easy for us to kind of do some initial deliveries in August,\nthat would be pretty easy. But then -- like we don't want to have like -- if we have had door handle issues,\nlike people are aware of that with the S. They don't want to have Falcon Wing door issues with the X. We\nwant to iron everything out, make sure it's good and then deliver at high volume. So effectively, we'd\ncreate like a captive fleet and iron out the issues with that captive fleet. They're quite big, several hundred\nvehicles basically. And maybe that addresses your release candidate question. And just make sure that\nthose several hundred vehicles really work well in all circumstances before we start delivering cars en\nmasse. Because we're going to go from just 1 of our cars to like 1,000 a week pretty fast.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nOkay. And just a second question, in the interest of time, and final question. Apple has kind of still,\nunofficially perhaps, been making inroads into building up its vehicle engineering and transportation\ncapabilities, according to a lot of sources, and making investments both in physical and human capital. Are\nyou starting to feel a greater sense of competition with Silicon Valley parties versus your ability to attract\nand retain key software and automotive engineering talent? And if Apple were to get into the electric car\nbusiness, would you see this as a positive for broader consumer acceptance of electric vehicles?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nActually, I certainly hope Apple gets into the car business. That would be great. But no, we're not really\nseeing significant attrition of engineers to Apple for anything, car or otherwise. And actually, anyone can\nlike figure this out by just going on LinkedIn. LinkedIn can produce statistics on what the relative flow\nof people is from one company to another. And I think it's like, something like 5 -- if you look at like the\ntrailing 12 months, I think Tesla's recruited 5x as many people from Apple as Apple has recruited from\nTesla. So it's like some fairly high number.",

And it seems like the factory size has increased almost 40%. And what is happening\nthere? Any thoughts you can share with us? And that's all for me.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, we're establishing a big casting foundry and machining facility there. And yes, that's intended to\nsupport activity in Fremont. So that's -- yes, that's what's happening in Lathrop primarily.",

        "paragraph": "Our next phone question will come from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.\nPatrick Kenehan Archambault\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nJust wanted to build on, I think, Ryan Brinkman's question, on the fourth quarter cash flow guidance. Does\nthat include income from those warehouse facilities to offset leased vehicles? Or is that exclusive of that?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nWell, our projection, as Elon said, was the end of the quarter, as we ramp up production, we should be\nfree cash flow positive on a pure sense. But frankly, our operations should be looked at without the impact\nof leasing. And that's a purer measure of operations, which is a lower threshold, I get it, but that's a\nunique or distinct decision we've made to be in that business.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nHold on a second, Pat. Deepak, do you want to explain about the classification of cash inflows within the\nstatement of cash flows?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nSure. Yes, if you look at our Q1 cash flows, for example, we received $155 million from our, either the\nwarehouse line or banking partners related to our leasing business. But that cash flow does not show up\nas an offset in our cash flow from operations. It shows up in our financing activities. So our cash flow from\noperations shows up $131 million negative. But if you offset that against the $155 million that we received\non the leasing business, we were slightly better than breakeven purely on an operations basis. And so our\nreal cash flow in Q1 was driven by the strong CapEx spend ahead of the Model X launches, the way we\ntend to look at the business internally.\nPatrick Kenehan Archambault\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nOkay, I appreciate that clarification. The other quick question I had is just I was a little surprised by the\n-- I think you guys had obviously very good gross margins this quarter relative to some of the headwinds\nthat you were facing. And I guess I was surprised to see that x ZEV, they go from 26 to 25. With some\nof the increases in pricing that you're putting through and some of the components that you're buying\noutside of the U.S. with a stronger dollar now, which -- where there was a little bit of a lag, I understand.\nI -- it just -- that seemed a bit conservative, and I don't know, maybe it ties back into Rod's earlier point\nabout mix, but I guess that was one area that I was a little surprised.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nSo just to clarify, the price increase that we've announced is not going to help us in Q2 given our book of\nbusiness. It's going to primarily affect us in Q3.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd also in April, for most of April, the dollar was pretty strong. It's just trended in the last week or 10\ndays or so, and we were continuing to deliver cars. So that strong dollar impact does roll over sequentially\ninto Q2 for us despite the lag effect of good news from a strong dollar. And as we said in the letter, we\nfully expect the mix impact to be offset by cost reductions that we will achieve. So it's really related to FX\nthat we see the sequential drop.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. The FX was really -- that was really a tricky thing to deal with. We had a quite strong European sales.\nAnd then the FX impact was quite significant. So obviously, if you've got a car that is, like let's say, 25%\ngross margin, and you've got -- and you see a 20% change in currency, it's like, wow, okay? That's not\nsuper easy to make up that difference.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. And to your point, and maybe this is a broader comment to make, that as we look at our Q1 non-\nGAAP loss that we have of $45 million, a big chunk or most of it could be attributed to the dollar strength\nthat has happened over the last 6 months. As we've indicated, our Q1 top line came down by about 3\npercentage points. And then we had the $22 million unrealized losses, from currency. You combine those\n2, and there's an offset in gross margin due to lower cost of parts we buy in foreign currencies. But\nconsider this whole mix and you can see the foreign currency change over the last 6 months can explain\nmost of the losses we had in Q1.\nPatrick Kenehan Archambault\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nAnd, yes, maybe just like that last piece is kind of interesting. How much are you able to take advantage\nof that natural hedge you just described, right? Because you are buying components in currencies that\nhave also depreciated, right? Batteries are one obvious thing. I'm sure you're sourcing a lot of stuff in\nMexico. Are you close to optimizing that? Or is that something that can be kind of exercised more?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nFor better or worse, one can look at it as a pro or con depending on the situation, basically, about 60%\nof the car, maybe a little more than 60%, is U.S. and Canada. So it would -- we may have -- we certainly\nhave, like, lots of, say, European companies that supply us, but they will supply us from plants in the U.S.\nor Canada or sometimes Mexico. So that's -- this really is a North American built car, like not -- for real.\nSo it's like, as Deepak is saying, it's slightly helpful if the dollar strengthens relative to the yen. But then,\nsince we have, like, quite strong European sales, this is -- I think it's like 5% of our parts or something\ncome from Europe. It's pretty low.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015\nRight.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nSo if our sales are 30% in Europe, then obviously there's not as much an offset as one would like. I\nactually thought it would be higher than that. But it's like -- because I'm looking at the names of the\nsuppliers, but not -- what matters is where -- not the name of the supplier. If their headquarter's in\nGermany, but where is the plant? So yes. I've got to go into another meeting, so if there are...",

Erickson\nPacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division\nJust a quick follow-up from the last one on the automotive gross margins. I think just x currency, can you\njust quickly talk maybe a couple of examples where you're looking to remove more costs from the car\nitself? I think we can all kind of appreciate there's continued scale advantages over time. But maybe if you\ncould talk about other cost savings opportunities we should be thinking about with both the S and the X,\nand sort of what inning we're in, in terms of achieving those savings?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, a big factor is labor hours per vehicle. That has steadily improved. It was sort of quite bad in Q4,\nparticularly with the P85 ramp, P85D ramp. We've made good progress on that in Q1, we'll continue to\nmake good progress on that through the rest of the year. So it's like labor and like direct overhead in the\nfactory.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, we're focused across every line item of our COGS, so material cost reductions, freight, both inbound\n-- we spoke a little bit about outbound freight efficiencies...\nElon R.

Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nBecause you know there was that big port strike was super-unhelpful. That also hurt pretty badly. It was\nlike the, I think, the worst port strike of the 21st century. And so we're also soldiering through that. So we\nhad like -- had to airfreight a ton of stuff...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nExactly right.\nElon R.

The\n-- just...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nWe continue with several engineering and promotional actions on material costs. It's a long list, not\nappropriate to go through.

Does that change in any way that you're looking at partnerships\nand bringing partnerships in, and maybe an update on timing there?

I think as Elon said, it's early days\non trying to make some of those changes in direction. But largely, it's just a bigger scope of opportunity\nfor a lot of the people we're already working with.
