The -- I think the most important point here that we want to make is that we're advancing the Q3 -- I'm sorry, the Model 3 build plan substantially. So -- and just overall -- the overall volume plan, with Tesla aiming get to the 0.5 million unit per year run rate in 2018 instead of 2020. And this is based off of the tremendous demand we see for the Model 3, which I think is actually a fraction of the ultimate demand when people fully understand what the car's capable of and are able to do a test drive. So this is probably the biggest change strategically. I think also, Tesla is going to be hell-bent on becoming the best manufacturer on earth. So the -- thus far, I think we've done a good job on design and technology of our products. The Model S and X, I think, are generally regarded by very critical judges as technologically the most advanced cars in the world. And so the -- I think, we've done well in that respect."

So that's -- I really want to sort of send the message out there to those -- to the best manufacturing people in the world, we want you to come join our company. And that is going to be the primary focus of Tesla is how do we get super good at making large, complex objects. So that's the -- I think, the most salient point. It's easy to get wrapped up in like a bunch of sort of short- term issues, but I think in terms of what matters in the future, I think that's the most significant thing. Overall, on the short-term stuff, our quarter-over-quarter stuff, I think, has improved quite significantly. Obviously, Model X production increased by a factor of 5 from Q4 to Q1, and we continue to make huge strides in volume and quality of the vehicle. And I'm personally spending an enormous amount of"

James Joseph Albertine Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division There's no doubt you have an incredible undertaking in front of you. Can you help us understand some of the key obstacles and how we should consider those obstacles between now and your anticipated launch of the Model 3 in late 2017, whether it's sort of P&L adjustments that we need to make along the way? But can you just help us sort of choreograph how that's going to take place? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect Sure. So with the Model 3, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we're really try to take a lot of lessons learned from Model X, where -- Model X, we put a lot of bells and whistles on Model X and a lot of advanced technologies that weren't necessarily for version 1 of the vehicle. With Model 3, we're being incredibly rigorous about ensuring that we don't have anything that isn't really necessary to make a very compelling version 1 of the car. We also have a much tighter feedback loop between design engineering, manufacturing engineering and"

        "paragraph": "production. And so no element of Model 3 can be approved unless manufacturing has said that this is easy to manufacture and that the risks associated with manufacturing it is low. There are many ways to skin a cat, and it's remarkable how you can achieve the same objective with a hugely varying degree of difficulty. You can sort of take the analogy and say, if you want to kill a fly, you can kill a fly with a thermal nuclear weapon, with a MOAB, with a cruise missile, with a machine gun or a flyswatter. So the end result is the same, but the difficulty is considerably more significant from one to the other, and the collateral damage is considerably more significant. So having that -- having production be really fundamental to the design of the Model 3, I think, is very important. And making sure we're not adding extraneous features to the 3 that aren't necessary to achieve the production volume is also extremely important. I'm not going to -- at the risk of this being misinterpreted, and probably there will be some number of articles that do, I think it's worth explaining sort of how manufacturing a"

And it's -- what -- in order to achieve volume production of a car -- a new car with several thousand unique items, you actually have to set a target date internally and with suppliers that is quite aggressive. And that is a date that is taken -- that has to be taken seriously. So like, the date -- because I'm sure this will leak. It's hard to keep a secret, really. The date we are setting with suppliers to get to a volume production capability with the Model 3 is July 1 next year. Now will we actually be able to achieve volume production on July 1 next year? Of course not. The reason is that even if 99% of the internally produced items and supplier items are available on July 1, we still cannot produce the car, because you cannot produce a car that is missing 1% of its components. Nonetheless, we need to work internally and with suppliers to take that date seriously, and they need to see some penalties for anyone, internally or externally, who does not meet that time frame. The"

        "paragraph": "-- that -- this is just -- this has to be the case because there's just no way that you have several thousand components, all of whom make it on a particular date. So the reality is that the volume production will then be some number of months later as we solve the supply chain and internal production issues. But it is a bit of a confusing thing, and it is -- it does create some churn, because people are like, \"Well, what's the real date?\" It's like you have to take the July 1 date seriously in order for some date a few months later or some number of months later to actually be the real date. So yes, that's actually how it has to work. So in order for us to be confident of achieving volume production of Model 3 by late 2017, we actually have to set a date of mid-2017 and really hold people's feet to the fire internally and externally to achieve an actual volume production date of late 2017. So as a rough guess, I would say we would aim to produce 100,000 to 200,000 Model 3s in second half of next year. That's"

Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial Officer Yes, this is Jason. I think we updated our guidance on OpEx for the year a little bit in the letter. We had talked about 20% last year and moving that range to 20% to 25% for 2016. So there's obviously going to need to be more OpEx at this. However, at the same time, you see how we improved quarter-over-quarter in terms of OpEx. We were down $12 million from Q4, down 3%.

Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ1 2016 EARNINGS CALL MAY 04, 2016 Yes, a couple of things there.

But also, we're just really focusing, as Elon has said, on capital efficiency and making sure that we are investing in the highest and best uses of cash. And I think those principles are what's going to guide the Model 3 program. Patrick Kenehan Archambault Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Yes, I mean, look, that's a good starting point to work with for us. I mean, we appreciate the update for this year. Maybe the way to take the question is just kind of understand when the peak spending periods are going to be. And if you're launching through middle of next year, is it kind of a good idea to maybe extend the amount of capital you see spending kind of in the balance of the 3 [ph] quarters through the second half of next year?

Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial Officer Sure, I think you're thinking about it the right way, the way you've laid it out. And you can kind of use Model X and Model S and the ramp of capital for those programs as a way to think about Model 3. On the R&D piece of it, that is a big driver behind our updating of our range to 20% to 25% OpEx in 2016. So we'll start to see a little bit of that in the second half of this year. And then certainly, some more into the first half of 2017. Patrick Kenehan Archambault Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Got it. If I can squeeze in one last one, just on the sourcing.

One, when do you kind of expect the Beta prototype to be achieved? When do you think you'll have firm specs for both your internal parts operations and for your external suppliers? And then in terms of the capital, do you see -- 2 other questions. Kind of when would you see raising capital, if at all, to meet this?

And so it's really gaining momentum very quickly. We feel pretty good about the trajectory of S and X. As for convincing all theTESLA, INC.

And I'd just say like, what I find ironic about a lot of the naysayers is that they -- the very same people will transition from saying it was impossible to saying it was obvious. I'm like, \"Wait a second. Was it obvious or impossible? It can't be both.\" Right? Benjamin Joseph Kallo Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Got it. And Model 3 battery, we're all analysts here. We stirred our straw [ph], dividing by 75 kilowatt- hours. Is that the right thing to do with the Model 3? Or should we have a lower number like 40 kilowatts or 45? And then, you've got the guy with the bolt making that car saying that it's going to be ahead of you guys, and then sell for cheaper than you. So how do I think about GM being able to make a car cheaper than you versus making a margin on a Tesla with a lower battery cost, if that makes sense? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect Yes, I mean, we don't want to get into like real specifics on battery pack size, but I think it's"

        "paragraph": "fair to say like the average battery pack size for the 3 will be less than 75 kilowatt-hours. That's... Benjamin Joseph Kallo Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division I'm sorry, what was that? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect The average energy content of a 3 pack is certainly going to be less than 75. It doesn't really need to be anywhere near 75 to achieve the range of 215 miles. So -- but we don't want to go into like -- I think getting into the nitty-gritty is probably unwise. Yes. So... Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer Yes, and I mean, I don't think it's probably -- you probably don't need to fixate on the 35 gigawatt hours. We're planning the Gigafactory to meet the production needs of the energy that we know the cars will need. So there's not a problem in scaling that as we need to. So obviously, internally, when you have -- we know the math, and we know what we need to do, and we're on track to do it. Benjamin Joseph Kallo Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division I guess my 18th question"

But how do I think about that ramp-up from 0 to 500,000 over -- let's push it, from 2018 on? Does it go from 0 to 500,000 over 2 years or 1 year? Or how do we think about that? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect Well, I mean, obviously, if we're saying that Tesla will have total vehicle production of on the order of 500,000 cars in 2018, it can't be more than sort of 2 years to get there. So now, the -- just sort of another -- maybe better efficient [ph] about -- education about production ramps is, production ramps look like an S curve. It's extremely difficult to predict with precision the early part of the S curve. So -- because in the early part of the S curve, you have -- it sort of starts off very slow and then it increases exponentially, it moves to a linear, and then moves to a logarithmic."

Should we think of it\nas like 300,000, 3? Or -- I mean, what's the kind of mix of those 3 vehicles?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, I mean, I don't think we've got like an amazing crystal ball to figure out exactly what it's going to\nbe. But I mean, I feel confident about the top line number, but the mix internally is -- it's difficult to figure\nthat out. I mean, yes -- but I mean, maybe it's something like 100,000 to 150,000 S and X, and then\n300,000 to 400,000 of 3. But this is -- I don't know, it's really hard to say.\nDana Hull\nHard to say? Okay. And then as you try to attract top manufacturing talent as you begin to ramp, have\nyou given any thought to trying to hire a COO? I mean, I'm just thinking about your personal life between\nTesla and SpaceX and sleeping in the sleeping bag and working 90 hours a week between 2 companies.\nSpaceX has a great COO and has had one since the company -- for years, but Tesla never has.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI mean, it's sort of -- I mean, it's really -- I mean, the sort of scope of Tesla's [indiscernible] activity is\nbroader than SpaceX. And SpaceX is more of a pure technology company and does not have the sort of\nsales, service and kind of fleet management, and customer financing, and all that sort of stuff that Tesla\nhas. Obviously, Jon's -- Jon McNeill's taking that -- has that role at Tesla. And then, my focus is primarily\non technology, design and then manufacturing. So -- but I mean, you certainly can expect that there will\nbe announcements in the fairly near future about some great executives joining the ranks."

It was about 10 minutes ago, you made a reference to 1 million vehicles in 2020.\nIs that a production target, a production goal, or a hypothetical? I'm just looking for some clarification\nthere.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectTESLA, INC. FQ1 2016 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 04, 2016\nI mean, that's my best guess. If we're 0.5 million in 2018, and then sort of roughly 50%-ish growth from\nthere, then, it's probably around 1 million in 2020.\nPhil Lebeau\nAnd do you not have an estimate as to how many production plants you will need in order to make that\nhappen?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, we -- I think it is actually feasible. Maybe not advisable, but feasible to do it with just Fremont and\nthe Gigafactory. We actually believe that Fremont and the Gigafactory could scale to 1 million vehicles.\nWhether that's actually wise is a separate question. And as I said earlier, it's going to make sense to\ndo localized production, at least on a continent basis. Otherwise, your logistics cost end up being quite\nextreme. Or they start -- your logistics cost start becoming a bigger and bigger percentage of the total\nvehicle cost. I mean, that's really why manufacturers build their cars for a local market. They build cars\nfor a market in that market because the logistics cost associated with shipping a 1.5- to 2-ton vehicle are\nmassively greater than, say, shipping a little consumer electronics device."

At the same -- second question is whether you had any takeaways from the -- your -- in terms of your suppliers, in terms of this HOERBIGER experience and how you can hold these suppliers' feet to the fire on some of these more complicated tasks that they're asked to fulfill.
