"summary_text": "The Tesla Q4 and Full Year 2016 Financial Results andQ&A Webcast will be available on the company's website at www.telsa.com. The webcast will also be made available on Tesla's IR website at http://www.tsla.com/investor relations."
"summary_text": "This conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jeff Evanson of Investor Relations. Mr. Evanson, please go to the bottom of the page for the webcast. The conference call is also being archived on the company's website."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I'd like to announce that our CFO, Jason Wheeler, has decided to leave Tesla \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0in April. Jason will be replaced by Deepak Ahuja, who was Tesla's first CFO and worked for the company for more than 7 years before stepping away in 2015."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I expect to remain with Tesla essentially forever unless somebody kicks me out. Jon McNeill: We're currently doing that, and we've been doing it quietly. The majority of Tesla cars are sold with an insurance product customized to Tesla. It takes into account not only these Autopilot safety features but also the maintenance cost of the car."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: The Model 3 is designed -- is really designed for manufacturing. It's considerably a simpler car than the S or the X. We simplified the wiring system considerably. The Gigafactory's a huge asset for powertrain, power electronics, chargers and a few other asset."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We had some challenges in the transition from Mobileye to Tesla software running on GPU. Safety is always our primary concern. Longitudinal control, [indiscernible] cruise control \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0is at 80 miles an hour. And I think we should be able to get both to around the -- maybe 85 miles anhour next month."
"summary_text": "The next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph, I guess, relates to the delivery guidance which I know you limited to the first half. Is there the -- and the launch of the Model 3, is there the potential for disruption to S and X? Is that also one of the factors why you're sort of -- decided to sort ofguide the way you did?"
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I think it will be fine to get rid of incentives and subsidies, but that should be uniformly applied to all industries. The irony of getting rid of it would actually improve our competitive position. Jason S. Wheeler: We don't put that too much into our concern because we're anti-sell."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: The only Model 3s will be like horribly negative margin, particularly on day 1. So it's just -- like no company on earth could -- there's no point for Tesla. So you have to get the production rate to some reasonable capacity percentage of the system."
"summary_text": "Jason S. Wheeler: The way to think about SolarCity on a go-forward basis is prioritizing cash generations through preservation over the near term for that business. The $2 billion to $2.5 billion CapEx guide, that spend, does that imply that that's not a full year 2017 number?"
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: The mandate becomes irrelevant at scale. Tesla will have as many more ZEV credits than the rest of the U.S. industry combined. The Model 3 will be pretty close to what I showed at the unveiling, but with more polish and refinement and a few more details that are added."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We're already in the stages of -- or beginning the second instance of anode and cathodes, the electrode assembly. The battery pack is divided into cells, modules and packs. We've got a lot of cash in transit as we move through the quarters, particularly at the end of the quarters when making deliveries."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I currently think that we should build 0.5 million vehicles next year and 1 million vehicles by 2020. And that's -- yes, 0. 5 million vehicles in total, S, 3 and X combined, next year should -- [indiscernible] as far as I have at my disposal."
"summary_text": "The next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners. Rob, can you give us any kind of breakout for -- maybe for if you just did it in percentage terms looking throughout the year, how much CapEx you're thinking for Model 3 versus Gigafactory and \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0versus Solar?"
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: There is no solar securitization in Q4. There was one in Q1. There is some sort of -- some fairly. obscure sounding dyes, like the -- like one dye for, like, seat frame. That's currently a long lead item. But since we know about it, we're attacking it."
"summary_text": "I think we'll reserve, keep some powder dry for those announcements later this year. There's probably more than enough news for today and I think -- but I think those announcements will be really quiteexciting later thisyear. And our next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson with Dougherty."
"summary_text": "Jason Wheeler: I think we're just focusing on our first half guidance rather than the second half. We don't anticipate needing to build much new square footage, for instance, at the Gigafactory. We have to drive efficiencies in G&A, and that's the way we're going to continue."
"summary_text": "The call is now over. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jeff Evanson.Jeff Evanson: Thank you, everyone, for joining today. Have a lovely evening. Back to the page you came from. The question-and-answer session has now ended."
