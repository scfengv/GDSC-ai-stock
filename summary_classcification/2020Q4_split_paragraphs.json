I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ4 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Paci\ufb01c Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent \ufb01lings with the SEC.(Operator Instructions) But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So just to recap the year, 2020 was a de\ufb01ning year for us on many levels. Despite achallenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5million cars. And I'd just like to once again thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort. Wedelivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history. So really an incrediblegrowth rate and despite a very challenging 2020. So my hat is off. It's such an"

We reached industry-leading GAAPoperating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash \ufb02ow.Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of newcapacity. We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and almost reached full productionspeed. We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, andShanghai continues to grow rapidly. We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.We ramped the single piece -- we started and we're able to ramp to volume production the single-piece castings for Model Y . This is where -- for the \ufb01rst time in history, the entire rear third skeletonof the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.We built a Model Y factory in China from start to \ufb01nish in 1 year.

So we've beenable to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X. And so Model S will be delivered in February andModel X a little later. For the Model S Plaid, we're actually in production now and we'll bedelivering next month.So this is a tri-motor Model S with a completely new interior. There are actually a lot of great thingsabout this. I'll do another call about the Model S later. But it's really a tremendous improvementover the prior version.And the Model S will be the \ufb01rst -- this Model S Plaid will be the \ufb01rst production car ever that isable to go 0 to 60 miles an hour in under 2 seconds.

This is a luxury sedan that is able to go 0 to 60 in less than 2 seconds andwill have the ability to seat up to 7 people with the third-row seats.So this is pretty nice. This is faster, to be clear, than any car. It's not like there was a different typeof car, like a 2-door sports car that was able to do fast -- it's the fastest accelerating car ever madefor -- that is allowed to go on roads in history. And like I said, we'll start delivering it in a matter ofweeks.And actually, we'll obviously get into the details what the Model S changes may be later this weekor next. But it's really better in many ways. We will be actually raising the price of Model S forthese new models of -- the old model -- the new model will be $10,000 more. So hopefully, peoplearen't too upset if they bought the old model last month. But this one, $10,000 more.

Additionally, we've been able to reduce ouruse of debt and various working capital lines, including settling $2 billion of convertible debt in Q4,which will continue into Q1.For net income, we achieved our \ufb01rst calendar year and 6 sequential quarters of pro\ufb01tability.

And now we can jump straight into questions from Say Technologies.The \ufb01rst question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from beingthe market share leader in solar?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So we're actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year. And we hadour best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4. So we do expect to become the market share leader insolar and then go far beyond it. It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had todevote the whole company to Model 3 production and building. And so we actually basically takethe whole company, including a lot of people that were on solar, and have them work on cars. Butnow we got a little more bandwidth, we're putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growingrapidly. So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOAnother really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure,which then allows us to have industry-leading pricing. And so that's something that we'veaccomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the place that it needs to be.And as Elon mentioned, this is a really important part with industry-leading pricing to become theleader in the space.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And actually, an important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwalland the Tesla retro\ufb01t solar and Tesla roof. And we're con\ufb01dent we'll have excellent integration --excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar, whether it's retro\ufb01t or the Tesla SolarglassRoof before the end of the year.So it's really -- I think we've got a good strategy. As Zach mentioned, we're focused on reducing theamount of time and the complexity of the install, and we're making great progress in that regard.And I think we'll have something that's really dialed in this year."

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Sure. It's true, the in-house cell manufacturing system we revealed at Battery Day contains newprocesses and equipment. So we did expect some unknown unknowns and technical challenges toarise through the production ramp. The Kato team, however, has been able to solve eachmanufacturing problem presented to date and continues to improve yield and rate week-over-weekand month-over-month as we move up the production S-curve. At the same time, the cellengineering team's re\ufb01ned designs and deepened understanding has reinforced our con\ufb01dence in thedrive process and 4680 design, meeting our performance and cost targets.And from a capacity perspective, we have 10 gigawatt hours worth of equipment landed at Kato.The production staff is nearly all hired. Our material supply chain is established and the team is ontrack for full production ramp this year. Meanwhile, we've developed enough engineeringcon\ufb01dence with our 4680 design and the production process and equipment to kick offmanufacturing equipment and facility construction to support our 100 gigawatt hour 2022 goal."

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI guess I'm con\ufb01dent based on my understanding of the technical road map and the progress thatwe're making between each beta iteration. Yes. As I'm saying, it's not remarkable at all for the car tocompletely drive you from one location to another through a series of complex intersections. It'snow about just improving the corner case reliability and getting it to 99.9999% reliable with respectto an accident.Basically, we need to get it to better than human by a factor of at least 100% or 200%. And this ishappening rapidly because we've got so much training data with all cars in the \ufb01eld. And thesoftware is improving dramatically. The -- we also write the software for labeling. And I'll say it'squite challenging. We're moving everything towards video labeling. So it's all video labeling, allvideo inference. And so there are still a few of the neural nets that need to be upgraded to videotraining and video inference. And really, as we transition each net to video, the performancesbecome exceptional.So this is like a hot thing. The video -- the labeling software that we work for, video labeling,making that better has a huge effect on the ef\ufb01ciency of labeling. And then, of course, the holy grailis auto labeling. So we're putting a lot of work into having the labeling tool be more ef\ufb01cient whenused by a person as well as enabling auto labeling where we can.Dojo is a sort of training supercomputer. We believe it will be -- we think it may be the best neuralnet training computer in the world by possibly an order of magnitude. So it is a whole thing in andof itself. And this is something we can offer potentially as a service. So some of the others needneural net training. We're not trying to keep it to ourselves.So I think there could be a whole line of business in and of itself, and then, of course, for trainingvast amounts video data and getting the reliability from, say, 100% to 200% better than averagehuman to 2,000% better than average human. Dojo will be very helpful in that regard."

How do you see this run rate evolving by mid-2021 or end of 2021?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we kind of talked about that, Drew. I mean essentially, what we're saying is that the numberto think about or focus on is like we've got a 100 gigawatt hour total Tesla cells produced in 2022.It's not that important to look at the run up to that because these things tend to improveexponentially. But we are installing capacity for -- in 2022 for 200 gigawatt hours a year, and wethink probably we should be able to achieve 30% of targeted design capacity in 2022.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Yes. Agreed, Elon. And as you've said before, with the S-curve of production, you can be off alittle bit on the initial part of the S-curve, and that makes a difference in absolute capacity by quite abit 1 month to the next. So yes, I mean we are progressing up that S-curve as fast as we possiblycan.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And we don't see any showstoppers.Andrew D.

Tesla had a reputation for outstanding customer service. Now it'simpossible to even call a service center, and appointments are scheduled weeks out. Jerome?Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionYes. Well, as far as best service, no service, so we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the qualityand the reliability of our cars. In the last 2 years, the frequency of service visits are reduced by 1/3.So people have to -- customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, noservice. And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in NorthAmerica. We're trying to push that to 50% this year. And 50% of service visits last less than 2hours. So we're trying to service the cars very quickly so people can get their vehicles back on theroad.And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve.

The question numberone, what are the key milestones we need to achieve in order to evolve current FSD to a commercialLevel 4, Level 5 ridesharing solution?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So it really goes back to what I was saying a moment ago, which is we need to transition overthe neural nets in the car to video. And in order to do that, the whole stack has to be -- the wholestack has to be changed to video. That means gathering video clips than using -- and this is actuallysurround video. So you've got 8 cameras operating simultaneously with synchronized frame rates.So you've got basically 8-frame surround video -- 8-camera surround video. And then you've got tolabel basically everything in that video snippet and then train against that and have those neural netsoperate the car.So -- and this is coming from the past where we would label, the neural nets would be a singlecamera, single frame. So no video and not combining the cameras. And then we went from singleframe, single frame, one frame at a time, one camera at a time, neural nets to surround camera,neural nets would look at all -- all 8 cameras but only one frame at a time and now to where weinclude the time dimension. And that's video.So I really do see this as a question of getting work done. We're getting it done. And you can see theresults in the rapidly improving FSD betas that are leased. And we're also going to be expanding theFSD beta itself to include more and more people.So from my standpoint, it looks like a very clear and obvious path towards a vehicle that will drive100% safer than a person. Yes. I really don't see any obstacles here. Yes."

And the second question from institutionals is, does Tesla plan or expect to license anyof its software applications, FSD and Autobidder in particular, to third-party OEMs?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we're very open to licensing our software to third parties. And we've had some preliminarydiscussions about licensing Autopilot to other OEMs. So this is something we're more than happy todo. And -- but I think, obviously, like we need to probably do a little bit more work to prove thatTesla Autopilot is capable of full self-driving, which, I think, will become obvious later this year.And then we're more than happy to license that to other car companies. We're de\ufb01nitely not tryingto keep it to be a Tesla exclusive situation.And I think probably same goes for Autobidder. We haven't thought as much about Autobidder, butthe Tesla philosophy is de\ufb01nitely not to create walled gardens. We're going to allow othercompanies to use our Supercharger networks, and yes, using our autonomy software andAutobidder and perhaps other things, we'd be \ufb01ne to."

Do we need to do things differently to win the Chinese EVmarket?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we currently are winning that -- we are currently the leader in the Chinese EV market. So Ithink we're must be doing something right if we're the best-selling electric car in China. That said,very few of our customers in China, I think maybe as low as 1% or 2%, actually have selected theFSD option. This is much lower than rest of world. So we de\ufb01nitely need to make it work well inChina. I think as soon as it works well in China, then we will have the take rate for FSD.I \ufb01nd that the customers in China -- Tesla owners in China are among the most discerning in theworld. Their attention to detail is incredible. So they -- I'm con\ufb01dent that they will buy FSD as soonas it is working well in China. And hopefully, that is later this year."

And the next question is, is it fair to argue that the best way to think about company'slong-term earnings power is tied to pro\ufb01t per unit of battery capacity? 3 terawatt hours target fromBattery Day implies half of long-term battery capacity goes to storage, depending on what youassume for pack size on Elon's 20 million vehicle unit goal?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, it is. So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability ofcells, what's the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours. And you can't grow faster than that. Nowat Tesla, we've improved the ef\ufb01ciency of our cars dramatically such that you can actually get apretty good range even with the Standard Range battery pack.It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the sort of high 200s. And withsome slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with the Standardpack, an order of 500 kilometers. So there's ef\ufb01ciency improvements in the car.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorAll right. So we \ufb01nished almost all of the Cybertruck engineering. So we're no longer iterating atthe design center level or design level. We've got the designs \ufb01xed. We're getting to -- we'll soonorder the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.We're obviously going to be using even bigger casting machines for the rear body of the Cybertruckbecause you've got -- obviously, it's a bigger vehicle and you've got a long truck bed that's going tosupport a lot of load. So we'll be using an 8,000-ton casting press for the rear body casting asopposed to 6,000 tons for Model Y . So 6,000 tons was the biggest casting machine in the world.8,000 tons is obviously quite a bit bigger than that.And I think it's going to be an incredible vehicle.

First, on '21, any expectations for what we shouldsee on regulatory credit sales? And then the second question is on capital. Obviously, you raised alot of capital in 2020. What should we think about the use of those funds beyond just covering someof the maturities? And can you just give us a sense of what the elevated liquidity does and doesn'tbuy? Meaning to what extent does elevated capital enable you to accelerate plans on buildingcapacity or expanding vertical integration, accelerating timing on full self-drive features? So thoseare the questions.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. On the regulatory credit sales side, this is always an area that's extremely dif\ufb01cult for us toforecast. 2020 regulatory credit sales ended up being higher than our expectations.

And these were discrete deals that were struck over the course of the quarter. So I wish Icould give you more on this, Dan, but it's a space that's extraordinarily dif\ufb01cult for us to forecast.On the second side, with respect to capital, a couple of things that we're thinking through there. Soas I mentioned in my opening remarks, debt reduction is an important thing that we're focused onnow.Early conversions, these are things we don't have a choice on. We did around $2 billion of that inQ4. We currently have $1.4 billion that we expect to go out in Q1 as a result of early conversions orconversions on convertible debt. That number may increase. And so debt reduction is important.That's helpful on interest expense as well.We are also using the money with respect to our investments in future capacity.

So as you saw in our Q4 numbers, the expansion of service centersand mobile service from Q3 to Q4 increased quite a bit and was also quite a bit higher than the \ufb01rstpart of the year. And so we're able now to make investments there and also in the Superchargingnetwork to get ahead of future demand, which will cost us more in the near term but is what theright long-term thing is for our customers and the company.OperatorOur next question will come from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler.Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior ResearchAnalystGreat.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThat is one of the things that -- or limits the growth rate. It doesn't limit the ultimate size. It limitsthe growth rate, which is what's the rate at which we can onboard great people and get them trainedin the right areas.You usually can't like instantaneously -- if you've got a factory that has 20,000 employees, you can'tjust hire 20,000 people instantly. They've got -- they were usually doing something else. So they'vegot to transition from whatever they were doing or move from some other part of the country. Andso there's a certain amount of time required for that.I mean that said, we do think that we can maintain a growth rate in excess of 50% per year for manyyears to come.

But we haven't really heard of anything since. But in the meantime, we'veseen a lot of activity in electric van and last-mile space from a number of established players orstartups. So I know you said that you have a lot of projects on the table, but can you provide us anupdate of your thoughts on this market? And is it something you're interested in?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think Tesla is de\ufb01nitely going to make an electric van at some point. The thing to bear in mind isthat there is fundamentally a constraint on battery cell output.

Scaling production is very hard.So a big part of the reason -- the main reason we have not accelerated new products is -- like, forexample, Tesla Semi, is that we simply don't have enough cells built. Like we -- this -- if we were tomake the Semi like right now, which we could easily go into production with the Semi, but wewould not have enough to cells for it right now. We will have cells -- enough cells for Semi whenwe were producing the 4680 in volume. But for example, Semi would use typically 5x the numberof cells that a car would use, but it would not sell for 5x what a car would sell for.So it kind of doesn't make -- it would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now, but it willabsolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean to be clear, we are still not -- the software still does not fully use the capabilities of theFSD version 1 computer. It is really just an incredibly powerful computer, and I'm personallycertain that you can create Full Self-Driving with safety Level 5 in terms of a person just using theFull Self-Driving version 1 computer.The version 2, we expect to be about 3x as powerful. And this needs to be paired with higher-resolution cameras. And so it's quite a -- it requires a bunch of things to change simultaneously. Butwe have not been rushing with version 2 of the chip. It's coming along well and it's in good shape.But since we can achieve FSD, Full Self-Driving, with the current system, it would actually be adistraction right now if we were to introduce the Full Self-Driving -- the Tesla FSD chip 2 becauseit would set us back quite a bit on software.

So in addition to building upcapacity, some of the goals you highlighted was to cut the pricing or the cost by about 50%, boostthe range by about 50% over a number of years. So wanted to know if your initial efforts aretrending in that direction. What is sort of like the time line to achieve these goals? And mayberelated to this, how are you thinking about the time line for the cheaper Tesla, the entry model,eventually?Elon R.
