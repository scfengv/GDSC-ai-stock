I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ3 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Paciﬁc Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ﬁlings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. All right. So Q3 was our best quarter in history. We achieved record production anddeliveries, record revenue, record net income, both GAAP and non-GAAP, and record free cashﬂow of $1.4 billion. This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team. I could not bemore proud to work with such a great group of people.

Of course, we had our Battery Day. So we hosted -- showed our batteries at our headquarters in California. And we also showed our cars around the world at our booth at the Mobile World Congress in New York City. So that was a lot of fun. It was a great way to kick off the year. And now, we're going to take your questions."

This is counterintuitive, but I'm quite conﬁdent this will be what happens.All right. So we presented what the team has been working on for a long time with batteries. Wewanted to step back and really rethink batteries from scratch. First principles thinking, just look at itfrom fundamental physics and say what -- rather than compare to other products in the market, justsay from a physics standpoint, if you -- what's the limit of physics? What's the platonic idea of aperfect cell and how close can we get there? And that was our aspiration. And I think we've got apretty good approach to it, which will only get better over time. And we went through all of theinteresting solutions for every important part of battery design and production. And we'll continueto iterate on that and just recursively improve the core cell and battery technology. The result, we think, in",

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we want to make our cars more affordable, and it's really important to separate outaffordability from value for money. If the car is too expensive or any given product is tooexpensive, then -- and people don't have enough money in their bank account, they simply can't buyit no matter what the value proposition is. I do not think we lack for desire for ourproduct, but we do lack for affordability."

Andthen you mentioned what you -- we want the world to look like ahead of us. What do you envisionthat? Is it like just Tesla or Tesla and Rivian or what?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I do think there will be other car companies. I don't think we're going to be the only one. So Imean, the things that -- like what other car companies do even in the auto segment is quite a smallsubset of what Tesla is. So Tesla, we design and build. We're very vertically integrated. So we'redesigning and building so much more of the car than other OEMs who will largely go to thetraditional supply base and like I call it, catalog engineering.
