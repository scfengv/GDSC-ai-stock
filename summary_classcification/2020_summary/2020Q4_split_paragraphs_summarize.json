I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ4 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Paciﬁc Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ﬁlings with the SEC.(Operator Instructions) But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So just to recap the year, 2020 was a deﬁning year for us on many levels. Despite achallenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5million cars. And I'd just like to once again thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort. Wedelivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history. So really an incrediblegrowth rate and despite a very challenging 2020. So my hat is off. It's such an",

And now we can jump straight into questions from Say Technologies.The ﬁrst question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from beingthe market share leader in solar?Elon R.

So we do expect to become the market share leader insolar and then go far beyond it. It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had todevote the whole company to Model 3 production and building. And so we actually basically takethe whole company, including a lot of people that were on solar, and have them work on cars. Butnow we got a little more bandwidth, we're putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growingrapidly. So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.Zachary J.

And so that's something that we'veaccomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the place that it needs to be.And as Elon mentioned, this is a really important part with industry-leading pricing to become theleader in the space.Elon R.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI guess I'm conﬁdent based on my understanding of the technical road map and the progress thatwe're making between each beta iteration. Yes. As I'm saying, it's not remarkable at all for the car tocompletely drive you from one location to another through a series of complex intersections. It'snow about just improving the corner case reliability and getting it to 99.9999% reliable with respectto an accident.Basically, we need to get it to better than human by a factor of at least 100% or 200%. And this ishappening rapidly because we've got so much training data with all cars in the ﬁeld. And thesoftware is improving dramatically. The -- we also write the software for labeling. And I'll say it'squite challenging. We're moving everything towards video labeling. So it's all video labeling, allvideo inference. And so there are still a few of the neural nets that need to be upgraded to videotraining and video inference. And really, as we transition each net to video, the performancesbecome exceptional.So this is like a hot thing. The video -- the labeling software that we work for, video labeling,making that better has a huge effect on the efﬁciency of labeling. And then, of course, the holy grailis auto labeling. So we're putting a lot of work into having the labeling tool be more efﬁcient whenused by a person as well as enabling auto labeling where we can.Dojo is a sort of training supercomputer. We believe it will be -- we think it may be the best neuralnet training computer in the world by possibly an order of magnitude. So it is a whole thing in andof itself. And this is something we can offer potentially as a service. So some of the others needneural net training. We're not trying to keep it to ourselves.So I think there could be a whole line of business in and of itself, and then, of course, for trainingvast amounts video data and getting the reliability from, say, 100% to 200% better than averagehuman to 2,000% better than average human.

So you've got 8 cameras operating simultaneously with synchronized frame rates.So you've got basically 8-frame surround video -- 8-camera surround video.

So Ithink we're must be doing something right if we're the best-selling electric car in China. That said,very few of our customers in China, I think maybe as low as 1% or 2%, actually have selected theFSD option. This is much lower than rest of world. So we deﬁnitely need to make it work well inChina. I think as soon as it works well in China,. then we will have the take rate for FSD. And hopefully, that is later this year. The next question is, key differences in product, customer preferences, FSD strategybetween China and the rest of the world. Do we need to do things differently to win the ChineseEVmarket?"
