        "original_text": "Okay. The second question from institutional is, what is your vision for software at Tesla? Whatopportunities do you see from monetizing the installed base other than via FSD?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorRight now, by far, FSD is just overwhelmingly the most important thing. I think the upgrading ofthe ﬂeet to Full-Self Driving, especially with an over-the-air software update, I mean, may go downas the biggest asset value increase in history as a step change. Maybe there's something bigger, butit certainly would be one of the biggest -- I can't think of anything bigger. So overnight, 1 million --depending exactly on when it happens and when it's allowed in various regulatory jurisdictions,you'd have like, I don't know, at least a few million cars suddenly becoming 5x more valuable orsomething like that, something like 5x higher utility. They go from like 12 hours a week of utility,something like that, that's hours of use, to 60, something like that. So everything else is pretty smallby comparison.Now when things do become Full-Self Driving, so what are people going to do in the car? Well, Iguess they're probably going to want to do productivity and entertainment of some kind. Watchmovies, play games and do work. That's in the future. Yes. We're already putting some games andstuff on the car, just for fun.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, we have been experimenting on that. And so FSD remains, by far and away, the biggestopportunity in the near term. But we're putting the plumbing in place to be ready to scale otherareas when the time is right. So premium connectivity subscription is something that we've put inplace. And the ability to upgrade your vehicle through the app, for example, on Acceleration Boost,or upgrading a Standard Range Model 3 to a Standard Plus, adding rear-heated seats. So these arethings that we have, and we're continuing to get feedback from the ﬁeld and other things that wecan launch, and we'll trickle those in with time.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. But they're all very tiny compared with like the step change to Full Self-Driving, dependingupon how you calculate it, is probably worth at least $100,000 per car. So that's a lot of softwareyou have to sell in the App Store or whatever, yes.",

So I think people will really come to expect that as some numberclose to 300 miles as normal.

And it's -- people don't want to have a -- get to their destination with like a 10 miles range.They want some reasonable margins.
