"summary_text": "Second quarter 2016 financial result Q&A. Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for your patience. You've joined the Tesla Motorssecond quarter 2016Financial Results Q&a. You're here to hear Tesla's financial results for the second quarter of 2016. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Jason Wheeler, Jon McNeill, and Jeff Evanson will discuss Tesla's second quarter 2016 results. During our call, we'll discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent SEC filings."
"summary_text": "Automotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits, grew from 20.1% in Q1 to 21.2% inQ2. We ended up with $3.25billion on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. We've got $678 million drawn on our asset-backed line. We're focused on volumetric efficiency."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I don't think there's a strong park rationale to combine SpaceX and Tesla, whereas there is for Tesla and SolarCity. There's a little cooperation that happens between the companies but it's not enough that would justify merging them into 1 entity. And can you also give us update us on your -- on Tesla's proprietary mapping initiatives?"
"summary_text": "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Brian, can you walk us between the 373,000 Model S preorders and the $375 million in deposits in the quarter? And what do the amendments to the credit agreement for SolarCity kind of do to your ability to borrow against that for this captive financing?"
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: There's no question Tesla's going to do integrated inverter. Most people don't even know what an inverter is. What is an -- they've never heard of this thing. Jason S. Wheeler: Our goal is to make them seamless and easy for people to use."
"summary_text": "Jonathan McNeill: We had year-over-year growth in Model S demand and we also -- we had some very healthy growth in the markets where we had cars in stores. So we had double-digit growth in both North America and China, and that growth has continued into the third quarter. Elon Musk: We're right around 2,000 vehicles a week."
"summary_text": "The quality, I think, has improved quite dramatically, particularly with respect to X. We had a lot of challenges in the production ramp. That's always the most difficult time when you're going from 0 to 1,000 cars a week. So I actually feel pretty good about warranty reserves actually declining over time as a result of that."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: Things are -- things feel really quite stable. We're kind of in the mode of continuous improvement, but no fundamental issues, so it's -- I feel like the machine that's making X and S is actually functioning quite well right now. The focus really is on Model 3, followed by full autonomy as probably the top 2 priorities."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: Because people are optioning up the 60, it actually ends up being decent. I mean, maybe it's sort of like 15% to 20% gross margin, whereas say, something like if. somebody orders the performance dual motor, that might actually be more like a 30%, 35% gross. margin. Jason S. Wheeler: We expect where we're at today, we'll see another 2 to 3 points of expansion between now and the end of the year."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll actually meet those numbers by the end of the year. The 60s may have some -- one other impact on gross margin. Elon, as you transition to an in-house autopilot, would you consider, in order to help build public support and confidence, about releasing regular reports similar to like Google does on what the technology is doing?"
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We were in production hell for the first 6 months of this year. And then we just managed to sort of climb out of hell or -- in like basically part way through June and now we're -- the production line is humming. And our suppliers mostly have their sh*t together. There's a few that don't."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: There's nothing even remotely close to demand constraints on the Tesla Energy side. The Model 3, I mean, the internal name for the designing machine that makes the machine is the -- what we call the alien dreadnought. At the point at which the factory looks like an alien Dreadnought, you know, it's like what the hell is that?"
"summary_text": "With the residual value guarantee going away, what happens to the accounting for revenues? Do you kind of get to something more close to what we see in other OEM financials and maybe just have the portion that's direct lease be accounted for as well? And what would be the timing of changes assuming they do have them?Jason S. Wheeler: The answer to timing, it changes right away."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: Full autonomy is it's really a software limitation. The hardware is -- I mean, the hardware exists to create full autonomy. It's really about developing advanced narrow AI for the car to operate on. So increasingly sophisticated neuro maps that can operate in reasonably sized computers in the car; that's our focus."
"summary_text": "All right. I think we'll just take a few more questions. So let's maybe do this and 1 or 2 more and call it a day. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Kallo of Robert W. Baird. Elon Musk, CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I think the quality of the ride is always going to matter. We don't want to stack Model 3 CapEx on top of other program CapEx, so -- but there's a lot we can do. There's going to be some pretty exciting unveils for the Tesla semi and the Tesla minibus or bus."
"summary_text": "The next question comes from Tyler Frank of Robert Baird. Tyler, can you discuss when you expect to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis? And then #2, you had mentioned on the last call that the Gigafactory may actually have the ability to produce about 3 times of your original estimate. Will that entail significant CapEx in the future or are you preparing that foundation right now to reach over 100 gigawatt hours?"
