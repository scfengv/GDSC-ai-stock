        "paragraph3": "But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nThanks, Martin. Last year was definitely the most challenging year in Tesla history, but also the most\nsuccessful. Thanks to the incredible work of the Tesla team, Model 3 became the best-selling premium\nvehicle in the U.S. for 2018. And in fact, when considering battery electric vehicles, Tesla achieved an\n80% market share of U.S. sales in the last year. I think this point is perhaps not well appreciated. All other\nelectric vehicles combined were 20% of sales in the U.S. in last year. So I think that's not bad.\nWe also delivered -- also made vehicles last year as we did in all prior years combined, which is a\ntremendous achievement by the Tesla team. The -- if you track Tesla vehicle production year-over-year,\ncumulative sales deliveries year-over-year, it is about the cleanest exponential I've ever seen. We've\nbasically almost doubled our fleet every year. Every year, we make as many cars as we did in all prior\nyears. So this is a very unusual thing to see for -- especially for a large complex manufactured object. I\nthink it may be the fastest that a complex manufactured object like a car has grown in history, or at least\nI'm not aware of anything that is faster. Martin, are you -- do you...?\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nI'm not sure. I think Model T was a little bit slower, but I'm not 100% sure.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nOkay. And we expect that exponential to continue. So with the deliveries this year being -- even in the\nface of -- if there's a global recession -- even if there's a global recession, we're expecting deliveries this\nyear to be about 50% higher than last year. And this -- it could be a lot more than that. But even with\ntough economic times, to receive 50% growth is pretty nutty.\nOver Q4, we achieved GAAP profitability for the second quarter for the first time in the company history,\nand we increased our cash on hand by more than $700 million, even after paying debt, ending the year\nwith a total of $3.7 billion of cash. This means we have enough cash to settle our convertible bond that\nwill mature in March.TESLA, INC.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5In addition, our operating margin remains strong at 5.7%. Operating margins in the fourth quarter are\nusually lower in the automotive industry, but this was not the case for Tesla.\n2019 is going to be an amazing year for Tesla. As I mentioned, we're expecting to increase sales by 50%.\nPerhaps it could be a lot more than 50%, but I think 50% is a very reasonable number. But that's crazy\ngrowth for the automotive industry.\nI want to note that one of our major priorities this quarter is improving service operations. So really, from\nmy standpoint, when I think about what my priorities are this quarter, it's improving service in North\nAmerica. That's #1. And I think there are some very exciting initiatives we're going to roll out with regard\nto that. We're going to get cars to China and Europe and make sure that we have good logistics for the\nwhole delivery process, from factory gate to the customer. That's obviously pretty far from California to\nget to Europe and China and then get to -- get product to our customers. So we're working every aspect\nof that logistics chain. And I think we've -- I think it's going to be good.\nI'd say at this point, I'm optimistic about being profitable in Q1. Not by a lot, but I'm optimistic about\nbeing profitable in Q1 and for all quarters going forward.\nSo let's see, we've opened 27 new store and service locations, bringing our total locations worldwide to\n378. And we increased our Mobile Service fleet to 411 vehicles. The Mobile Service fleet is something we\ncan scale up very rapidly, because we don't need bricks and mortar. We can get more vehicles, hire people\nand deploy rapidly. It also actually results in higher customer satisfaction, because we can actually send\none of our service vans to your work or home and fix the car without you having to bring it into a service\ncenter or do any paperwork or anything like that. It's really seamless, invisible, the customers love it.\nAnd we're also increasing the functionality of the Tesla App for service, so that instead of having to make\nan appointment, to call and make an appointment, you can just open your Tesla App, say you want to\nmake a service appointment, and it lists the top 10 most frequently requested service items, and you\ncan, with a couple of taps, you've made your service appointment. And we're going to make it easier for\nthe car to be picked up and dropped off as well. So if you want -- if you prefer not coming to the service\ncenter at all, you can just request that the car be picked up and delivered. That's something that we'll be\n-- so that's already been rolled out and have a big improvement to customer satisfaction. That rolled out 2\nor 3 weeks ago.\nBut the next thing we're going to add is, if your car detects something wrong, like a flat tire or a drive unit\nfailure, that before the car has even come to a halt, there is a tow truck and a service loaner on the way.\nSo the car has already notified Tesla emergency services, and a service loaner, a tow truck, are on their\nway before your car has even come to a stop. Now this will be immense in improving customer happiness.\nBasically, it'll just call it and you'll have to tap the center screen to cancel it. So you can cancel it if you\nwant. We just have to -- it's like automatically going to happen, you just press cancel.\nWe're also improving product distribution. So I think we made a strategic error in the past about not\nhaving service parts located at our service centers. We had them in product distribution warehouses,\nwhich basically meant it was impossible to have a fast turnaround on servicing a car, because the car\nwould come in, then the parts will be requested, they come to the service center, this would basically --\neven for a very simple repair, could take days. So we're going to be able to stock in all common parts at\nthe service centers, so that it's possible to -- and first of all, have -- get your car serviced in 20 minutes or\n15 minutes, even, if it's a simple matter. I mean, it should be like Jiffy Lube, like 8 minutes or whatever,\nnot 8 minutes, that's -- it should be like lightning fast. But in order to do that, we have to have the parts\nlocated at our service centers.\nAlso, it's going to make sense for our service centers to do basic body work or essentially, if all you need\nto do to is replace a front or rear fascia, it makes sense to just pre-stock the front and rear fascia in\nthe common colors. So unless you have an unusual color, we can literally replace your fascia in 15, 20\nminutes, and there's none of this, like, weeks at a body shop stuff.\nLet's see, in terms of the new products, with Model Y, we've completed [ ensuring ] of and design of Model\nY, and the products are -- the tooling that's going out for production of Model Y, 3/4 of the Model Y isTESLA, INC.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6common with the Model 3, so it's a much lower CapEx per vehicle than Model 3. And the risk is also quite\nlow. This is in contrast to Model S versus Model X, where the theory was -- I think Model X, we just --\nit's like sort of Model X to be like sort of the Faberg\u00e9 egg of cars. It's a -- it's an incredible vehicle and\nprobably one -- probably nothing like it will ever be made again, and maybe it shouldn't. But it is a work\nof art. It's a special work of art. But the commonality with the Model S is limited. It was only about maybe\n30% in common with the Model S, whereas Model Y is, I think, 76% or something like that, in common\nwith the Model 3. And we're most likely going to put Model Y production right next to -- in fact, as part of\nour main Gigafactory in Nevada. So it will just be right there, batteries and powertrains will come out and\ngo straight into the vehicle. So that also reduces our risk of execution and reduces the cost of having to\ntransfer parts from California to Nevada. It's not a for-sure thing, but it's quite likely, and it's our default\nplan.\nI would expect Model Y will probably be -- the demand for Model Y will be maybe 50% higher than Model\n3, could be even double. The -- as I understand it, the mid-sized SUV segment is the, worldwide, is the\nmost popular type of vehicle. So we'll probably see a higher volume of Y than 3.\nAnd earlier this month, we started construction of Gigafactory Shanghai, and by the end of this year,\nwe expect to be producing Model 3s using a complete vehicle production line. That's body, paint, final\nassembly, general assembly and module production. So it basically would be -- this should be extremely\nfast. I get like daily updates of progress of the Shanghai Gigafactory, and those factories are going to\ngo up like lightning. So we do feel quite confident at this point, at least for the factories that are in our\ncontrol, that we can achieve volume production in Shanghai by the end of the year. And that should allow\nus to get to the 10,000 vehicles a week rate, or very close to it, by the end of the year.\nAnd yes, I think that's it.TESLA, INC. FQ4 2018 EARNINGS CALL  JAN 30, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7Question and Answer\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay, great. So we're going to take the first questions from our retail investors who have been submitting\ntheir questions on say.com. So the question that has been submitted has been about service, which I think\nyou already spoke at length about. So let's go to the second question.\nThe second question would be, how are you feeling about demand right now across the product line? Is\n500,000 to 700,000 units at $42,000 ASP still a realistic annual target for Model 3, even considering Model\nY and its impact on demand? And do you continue to see S and X demand of 100,000 annually?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nI mean, my best guess, this is just a guess, my best guess for demand of Model 3 worldwide is something\n-- in a strong economy, is something on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year. That's my best\nguess for demand of Model 3 in a strong economy. If the economy goes into a recession, then I think\nthat could be something on the -- 40% less. But I think even in a recession, worldwide demand is still\nsomething in the order of 500,000 for Model 3. For S and X, we did eliminate the 75 kilowatt hour version\nof S and X and to provide more differentiation relative to 3 and then Y that's coming out. I think we could\nsee a slight decline in total vehicles, but I think the net cash flow from S and X is likely to be very similar.\nSo probably no major change in net cash flow for S and X.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. The next question from Alex is, can you please share an update on full self-driving and Tesla\nNetwork development? When will customers start to see full self driving features? What's the best case\ntime line for Tesla Network to go live?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nSure. We -- we already have full self-driving capability on highway. So from highway on-ramp to highway\nexit, including passing cars and going from one highway interchange to another, full self driving capability\nis there. In a few weeks, we'll be pushing an update that will allow the option of removing stalk confirm\nin markets where regulators approve it, which we believe that will be the case in the U.S., for example.\nAnd over time, we think probably all regulators will approve it. But we kept stalk confirm there just to\nmake sure that we took care of like -- of any strange corner cases. And it's really quite sublime, if you\nhave stalk confirm off and like the car goes from highway on-ramp, passes slower cars, change -- takes an\ninterchange and then takes the exit and then comes to a stop after the exit. So it's really quite profound\nto have that experience. Then the next part of full self-driving would really be to -- is traffic lights. So\nit's hard. So stop streets are pretty easy because you can essentially geocode those and it's easier to\nrecognize stop signs. Traffic lights and intersections will be the next really tricky one. And then navigating\ncomplex parking lots and like -- so like if you're underground in a mall parking lot with a lot of traffic and\npedestrians and it's on multiple levels, that kind of thing is what gets tricky. With the release of enhanced\nor advanced Summon, you'll see the first indications of the car being able to navigate complex parking\nlots, and that's also coming out fairly soon, probably next month. And in development mode, the car does\nall of the things that I just mentioned in development mode. It recognizes traffic lights and stop signs and\nbasically has all the functionality in development mode. It's really just a question of getting the reliability\nof recognizing traffic lights to several 9s, like -- so maybe it's like, I don't know, 98% good right now, but\nwe need it to be like 99.999%, really extremely reliable. So in a nutshell, when the capability will be there\nfor -- when will we think it's safe for full self-driving, it's probably towards the end of this year, and then\nit's up to regulators to decide when they want to approve that.TESLA, INC.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8Martin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. Let's go to the next question, which is, if and when will Tesla switch Model S and X to 2170 battery\ncells? What percent range improvement do you expect?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nWe have no plans to switch S and X to 2170 and can't comment on future product developments.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. So maybe we'll take the last question from retail investors, which was, where will Tesla Semi and\nModel Y be produced? Can you share a time line on expected production ramp of these products?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nI was mentioning earlier, the Model Y, we think, most likely will be produced at Gigafactory, but that's\n-- unless we encounter some obstacle -- that's the default plan that we're proceeding towards. And it's\nfast, lower risk and relatively low CapEx. In terms of the -- I mean, probably there's like initial production\nof Model Y, very low volume, early next year. But then it always takes time to ramp up any production\nsystem, and it's difficult to predict the shape of that S-curve. So we feel confident in saying there will be\nproduction volume of Model Y by the end of next year. But in between beginning of next year with low\nvolume, it always starts with very low, and then it grows exponentially, from beginning of last year to end\nof next year, it's difficult to predict that ramp. So that's our expectation for Y. For Semi, we're -- I don't\nknow if you want to comment on that, Jerome?\nJerome Guillen\nPresident of Automotive Division\nGoing to start next year as well.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes.\nJerome Guillen\nPresident of Automotive Division\nBut the first units will be -- this is Jerome -- well, first units will be for our own usage. So depends how\nmany trucks we'll use for our own usage to move the parts and the vehicles to different locations, and\nthen we'll start delivering to outside customers.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes, sounds good. And then the Tesla pickup truck, we might be ready to unveil that this summer. It will\nbe something quite unique, unlike anything else.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay, fantastic. So operator, we can start taking questions from participants on the call."

Is there any guidance you can provide us in terms of how to think about CapEx for\nthis facility going forward? And can you discuss the source of funds for the project? I think you've spoken\nin the past about the potential to raise debt locally in China. Is that still your thinking? And what kind of\nterms might you be able to raise that capital?\nDeepak Ahuja\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Deepak here. You're right. The purchase of the land is a 50-year lease with the government of China.\nSo it's not CapEx, but it's operating lease that shows up as cash flow from operations. However, the CapEx\nthat we will invest is our equipment, and we fully own it. So that will show up as capital expenditures. The\nplan, as we have indicated in the letter, is still to get funding for a majority of debt capital spending from\nlocal China banks. And we expect pretty attractive rates based on the dialogue we've had. And there's a\nlot of interest. And we hope to finalize that and then share the details at that point.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes, I mean, as a ballpark figure, probably it's something about -- something in the order of $0.5 billion in\nCapEx to get to the 3,000 vehicle rate in Shanghai, ballpark figure. And as Deepak was saying, we've been\noffered very competitive debt financing in China, really extremely compelling interest rates, so we do not\nexpect that to be a capital drain on the company.\nDeepak Ahuja\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, these are the biggest banks in the world, and for them, $500 million is not a large amount of money\nin the scheme of things."

        "paragraph5": "Our next question comes from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nOne thing is -- sorry, I just wanted to -- something that's perhaps, if you're in the automotive industry,\nyou'll understand how significant this is, but maybe it's not as obvious to everyone, is Tesla has the first\nwholly-owned manufacturing facility in China for any -- of any automotive company. So this is profound,\nand we're very appreciative of the Chinese government allowing us to do this. I think it is symbolic of\nthem wanting to open the market and apply fair rules for everyone, and I want to extend, like, a note of\nappreciation for the Chinese government in allowing us to do that. It's a very significant thing.\nCharles Eugene Munster\nLoup Ventures, LLC\nThis question I have is relative to Waymo and the autonomous driving opportunity. Morgan Stanley\nrecently valued Waymo at $175 billion. And my question is, what do they have that you don't have? And\nseparately -- so what do they have that you don't have, and then separately, how important is autonomy\nto the Tesla story longer term? Is this nice to have? Is it really about EVs and renewable energy? Or is the\nautonomy kind of one of the foundational parts of the story longer term?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nTo find out the goodness of Tesla, so like sort of the why of Tesla, the relevance, what's the point of Tesla,\ncomes down to 2 things: acceleration of sustainable energy and autonomy. The acceleration of sustainable\nenergy is absolutely fundamental because this is the next potential risk for humanity. So obviously, thatTESLA, INC. FQ4 2018 EARNINGS CALL  JAN 30, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10is, by far and away, the most important thing. But also, very important is autonomy. This has the potential\nto save millions of lives, tens of millions of serious highway injuries and give people their time back so\nthat they don't have to drive, they can -- if you're on the road, you can spend time doing things that you\nenjoy instead of being in terrible traffic. So it's extremely important. We feel confident about our technical\nstrategy, and I think we have an advantage that no one else has, which is that we have, at this point,\nsomewhere in the order of 300,000 vehicles on the road, with a 360-degree camera sensor suite, radar,\nultrasonics, always connected, uploads, especially video clips with [ customer information ], when there's\nan intervention. So effectively, we have a massive, massive training fleet. Our -- the miles of training\nthat we have, if you added everyone else up combined, they're probably 5%, I'm being generous, of the\nmiles that Tesla has. And this difference is increasing. A year from now, we'll probably go -- and if you go,\ncertainly, if you go 18 months from now, we'll probably have 1 million vehicles on the road with -- and\nevery time the customers drive the car, they're training the systems to be better. I'm just not sure how\nanyone competes with that."

Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nWell, I think we did, actually. Yes, it's clear in our letter.\nDeepak Ahuja\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nCorrect. We indicated in Q1, we will start delivering Model 3s in Europe and China. And we also shared a\nchart showing the potential market size for mid-sized premium sedans in North America, Europe and Asia,\nsuggesting those markets can be even bigger.

Well, our manufacturing keeps improving quarter-over-quarter, actually, week-over-week.\nWe take fewer hours, both here in Fremont or at the Gigafactory, to assemble the Model 3 and S and X\nas well. And then we track the quality very closely. We review that carefully with the engineers and the\nsupply chain and the manufacturing teams. And the quality in the field and the number of incidents is also\nimproving week-over-week, every week. So there are fewer and fewer need for cars to be in service, yes.\nSo we'll keep going. There's no end in sight. And we'll try to make sure that the car never breaks down.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes, I think there's like some confusion about rectification. Like I said -- like for us, regarding the Model 3s\nthat come off the line, all that happens is like some slight adjustment of drawer gaps and panel gaps and\nthat kind of thing, and that's all that's done.

I mean, any color on what price you're expecting that to be? Because I think there's a lot of\nchatter that demand is already weak in -- of the midrange, at least, already in January. I don't know if\nthat's true as well.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes, I mean, the -- it's more like there are multiple factors at play here. First of all, there's a lot of\nseasonality to automotive purchases. Most people do not buy a new car in the middle of a blizzard. So\nJanuary and February tend to be seasonally low and then it picks up significantly around the early to\nmid-March time frame. In the U.S., we obviously have a pull forward of demand from the tax credit. And\nyes, there's -- so there's those factors. But I feel very confident about Model 3 demand.

What are your latest thoughts in terms of timing\nof introduction? I think at some point, you had in mind to do it in the -- maybe the first half of this year.\nAnd just to clarify, when you're sort of talking about the outlook for 2019, the number of deliveries up\n50% and then the margin target for Model 3 to get to 25%, does that assume that you're introducing a\nlower range, the short-range Model 3 at some point during the year?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nWell, we call it the standard range, but it's maybe short by Tesla's standards, but it's long range by other\nmanufacturers' standards. So -- but yes, we expect to introduce the standard range Model 3 sometime,\nprobably the middle of this year is a rough -- rough guess. And we're working hard to improve our costs\nof production, our overhead costs, our fixed costs, just costs in general. I think this past year, while\nextremely difficult, has driven us to a high level of financial discipline. I think we're way smarter about\nhow we spend money, and we're getting better with each passing week. Yes.\nEmmanuel Rosner\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nAnd so to be clear, the -- you expect to reach at some point this year, or you're targeting at some point\nthis year, 25% gross margin on Model 3, and that's despite introducing the lower-end, or I guess, the\nstandard range Model 3. Is that correct?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes.\nEmmanuel Rosner\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nOkay. And I guess, my follow-up would be on the demand side. So you're talking about 50% increase this\nyear. You said a few times that it could be higher than this. I think you just mentioned in the previous\nquestion 350,000 to 500,000, if I understood well. So what is sort of like what drives the cautious outlook\nthat's in your letter? Because it feels like it's the -- it's just basically 4x the fourth quarter run rate, which\nwould imply sort of 50% for the full year, but not really a lot of growth versus what you just accomplished.\nSo I guess, how do we think about the total demand for 2019, especially if you introduce this -- the\ncheaper version?\nElon R.

Our car is just very expensive going into China. We've got import duties. We've got transport\ncosts. We've got higher-cost labor here. And we've never been eligible for any of the EV tax credits. A lot\nof people [indiscernible] being so dependent on incentives. In fact, we are, for a company making EVs,\nwe have the least access to incentives. It's pretty crazy, because there's so many companies that, that\n-- countries that have put price caps on the EV incentive, which differentially affect Tesla. And in China,\nwhich is the biggest market for EVs, we've never had any subsidies or tax incentives for vehicles. So it's\ndifficult. Once a car is made there, it is eligible for that. But it sounds like that's going to be reducing in\nChina in the coming years. But really, bottom line is, we need the Shanghai factory to achieve that 10k\nrate and have the cars be affordable. The demand for -- it's important to appreciate, the demand for\nModel 3 is insanely high. The inhibitor is affordability. It's just like people literally don't have the money to\nbuy the car. It's got nothing to do with desire. They just don't have enough money in their bank account.\nIf the car can be made more affordable, the demand is extraordinary."

Ferragu\nNew Street Research LLP\nSo Deepak, I was wondering, so as you get to 2019, we're all concerned about a potential recession, and\nI was wondering how you think about it and what you would tell us about what we should expect -- how\nwe should expect Tesla to react to a recession in 2019. How do you manage your volume [ LAM ]? How do\nyou manage your pricing? How do you possess cash? How do you manage your CapEx if things turn south\nin 2019? And then I have a follow-up on gross margin for Jerome.\nDeepak Ahuja\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, it's a very broad question, which is not really just for me to answer. But I think at the highest level,\nthe way we are trying to be prepared for any kind of contingency is to just continue focusing on cost.\nAnd the theme of our conversations here is, how do we reduce cost all the time? And how do we run\nour business with a very high level of financial discipline? And Elon alluded to that and so did Jerome, I\nthink. That if we do that, we believe that even in some of the scenarios of lower volumes and pricing, tight\npricing, we do have a good chance and a good shot of being profitable and generate free cash flow. So\nthat's the best way to manage the business, be frugal.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes, I don't want to be a broken record about this, it's costs, costs, costs, cost, because reducing our costs\n-- by the way, while making modest improvements to Model 3, I want to emphasize, the product is getting\nbetter by slight degrees despite lower cost, in hundreds of small ways, that you actually wouldn't -- most\npeople wouldn't notice explicitly, but they would appreciate subconsciously. And getting those costs down,\nvariable costs and fixed costs, is what allows us to lower the price and be financially sustainable and\nachieve our mission of environmental sustainability. So we have to be absolute zealots about this, there's\nno question.\nDeepak Ahuja\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nThe other aspect of this, Elon, which we've been doing extremely well, is capital efficiency. We have\ndramatically cut back on capital expense, and we are spending it in a very efficient manner. We talk about\nit in the letter on Model 3 and Gigafactory Shanghai. We talk about it for Model Y. There are just so many\nlearnings that we are incorporating. And we just want to beat what we did with Model 3 and the kind of\nspending we had for the returns we got.\nElon R. MuskTESLA, INC.

I mean, like, we're confident that our CapEx per unit of production for Shanghai factory and\nfor Model Y will be less than half of what we did for Model 3. Internally, we think it might be a quarter, but\nthat's probably too good to believe, but it's definitely less than half."

Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nFirst thing I want to just understand is on what you're seeing from European orders and China orders so\nfar. There are some numbers that get thrown around, but you guys are obviously taking a look at it. How\nis that order profile shaping up relative to what you saw in the U.S. with the launch of the 3?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nI think it seems good. I mean, our issue actually with Europe and China is how do we get the cars made\nand on a boat as such that it reaches customers before end of quarter and we don't have a massive\nnumber of cars on the water. That's our biggest challenge. It's not demand. It's how do we get the cars\nthere fast enough.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nSo like orders above, I think I've seen like 20,000 order levels for Europe and single-digit thousands for\nChina, it's better than that, Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes, absolutely. The -- I mean, we're not even really trying, I should point out. I guess, it's -- we -- our\nfactory is like, right now, only making cars for China and Europe. That's all it's doing for -- with respect\nto Model 3. And our whole focus is, okay, how do we get those cars made, get them on a ship as fast as\npossible, get the ship as fast as possible to Zeebrugge in Belgium, then get them over to Drammen in\nNorway and get those cars to customers as fast as possible. We get them to China as fast as possible.\nAnd China, we're also -- yes, we don't what's going to happen with the trade negotiations. So it's very\nimportant to get those cars, especially to China, as soon as possible. We hope the trade negotiations go\nwell, but it's not clear. But we need to get them there while there's sort of a de facto -- sort of a truce on\nthe tariff war. And the demand gen is really not one of the things we're thinking about.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Then just lastly on this demand thread, customer deposits came in again over $100 million. Is it\npossible to give us an update? I know you don't think it's really a relevant number, but I do and I'll explain\nwhy. On the reservation count, where you were at 450,000, you started delivering. And I ask this because\nI think we're just all trying to understand how much incremental demand you think there is based on what\nyou see at that lower price point if, say, there's over half of those people that are still waiting for that 75k\nbase model to come out. That would be interesting, and I think that's what you're seeing, but I just want\nto confirm that.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nSo Deepak, do you want to...?\nDeepak AhujaTESLA, INC.

Now we do have\na large reservations backlog still, which tells us that a lot of customers are still waiting for those cars, but I\ndon't think it's appropriate to share the reservations number.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nReservations are just like preorders. It's like you have like some video game come out and it's like a\npreorder number, then that's like -- stops being important once you start shipping the game or product.\nSo yes, as I said earlier, I think -- my guess is demand is somewhere on the order -- in a strong economy,\nis on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year for Model 3 and even in a recession is probably on the\norder of 0.5 million."

What do you think is driving that? And maybe\nyou can just talk about the opportunities and challenges in Europe, especially from a delivery logistics\nperspective.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nWell, like I said, we're thinking about demand almost 0 right now. It's really getting the product there in\ntime and not having a ton of cars on the water end of the quarter and then for China, getting cars there\nbefore there's a potential rise in tariffs. That's really -- put really at front of mind, that cost reduction and\nthen improving service in North America, yes.\nDaniel Harlan Ives\nWedbush Securities Inc., Research Division\nAnd just maybe a quick follow-up. Can you just talk about, when we look at the Gigafactory build-out in\nChina and obviously how important that is, maybe just fast forward, let's say, 18, 24 months, I mean, how\ndo you envision that as just a competitive advantage versus maybe some other automakers that will be\ntrying to go in your tracks?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nI think it will be quite a significant advantage. I really view it as quite fundamental to the future of\nTesla, and I expect to make several trips to China this year. And I'm working very closely with the team\nbuilding the factory. I literally get daily updates. So it's a super big deal and we're only just talking about\nPhase 1 here. Phase 1 is about 10% of what we think the Gigafactory will ultimately be.

And I'm wondering if you can talk about how much of the price differential between the $50,000\nModel 3 and the $35,000 Model 3 is structural, meaning that powertrain costs for EVs are just structurally\nhigher than they are for internal combustion engine cars? And where you think that difference is today and\nwhen that is no longer a factor? So is -- or maybe said another way, is the bigger driver in getting to lower\ncosts and lower -- and more affordability on the Model 3, is it really around the powertrain and getting\nthat at parity? Or is it everything else about Tesla not being as efficient as other manufacturers that is\ncausing the higher price right now? And have I follow-up, please.\nJerome Guillen\nPresident of Automotive Division\nIt's both, it's both the vehicle and both the powertrain. So I split my time half and half between the\nGigafactory and here, and there is opportunities in both, yes.\nDeepak Ahuja\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nBut I think the bigger point is that, yes, there is cost reduction opportunities out, but the bigger point is\nnot that our cost is higher than a gas-powered or an internal combustion engine.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nI think what Toni meant is with a battery pack, as in battery pack as well as the powertrain together, are\nmore expensive than an engine.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nThat's true.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nAnd how big do you think that delta is today? And when it's -- do you think of it as being kind of $10,000,\n$11,000 for that pack plus powertrain for an electric vehicle and maybe $5,000 or $6,000 for an internal\ncombustion engine car? And is that sort of the order of magnitude? And where do you see those getting\nmuch more aligned, just sort of given the laws of where you think cell and pack costs are going?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nWell, the biggest part to bear in mind is the cost of electricity is quite a bit less than the cost of gasoline,\nespecially in Europe or in California or China, basically almost everywhere except, say, the middle of the\nUnited States, the cost of gasoline is very expensive and electricity is far cheaper. The -- so that factors\ninto the cost of ownership pretty significantly. It's on -- sort of on the order of $50 to $100 a month,\ndepending upon how much somebody drives. So that's a very important thing to consider for an electric\ncar versus a gasoline car. The -- that said, in terms of initial cost of acquisition, I think it's probably -- this\nis just off the top of my head, not a calculated number, probably on the order of 7k, but trending towards\n4k or 5k. Just off the top of my head.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nOkay. And as you think about 2019, you talked about sort of scenarios for demand and how you plan to\nroll out the intermediate range and then ultimately the standard range. What is -- if you do have to make\na trade-off on volume or profitability during the course of the year, meaning to get the volume you need\nor you think you can deliver, you have to go to lower margins or vice versa, where's the trade-off?

Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes, my guess is it ends up being sort of about the six in one, half dozen the other, where if there's a\ngiven amount of free cash flow, you sort of decide -- you decide to achieve that with a smaller production\nor smaller volume of cars at a higher margin or large volume cars at a smaller margin.

When can we expect it? And can you talk\nabout what percentage of S and X have historically been leased in the U.S.?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nWell, we've been reluctant to introduce the leasing on Model 3 because of how -- of its effect on GAAP\nfinancials.

And is it included in your expectation of a small profit?\nDeepak Ahuja\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, it is included in that. It's difficult to say exactly what that is. At this point, it's, let's say, roughly\naround $40 million, but that number can vary slightly.\nDaniel V. Galves\nWolfe Research, LLC\nOkay. And then just the last one is...\nDeepak Ahuja\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSorry, go ahead.\nDaniel V. Galves\nWolfe Research, LLC\nYes, the last one is, this change in your service parts structure to make things more distributed rather\nthan in the parts warehouses, would that be like a meaningful working capital drag? What's the cash\nimpact of that?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nNo, it's actually -- we've just been very silly about where we store our parts. So it's actually going to be\nno change in sort of working capital or not something you would even notice in the financials. It's just\nbeing smarter about sending parts directly to service centers, in fact, either directly from our factory here\nor from our suppliers, and just ship them direct to the service center. Right now -- actually, our costs will\nimprove, I think, actually quite a lot, because there's been actually quite -- the current system is quite\nboneheaded, actually, speaking self-referentially. So just being -- so stopping doing the foolish things will\nmassively improve our service costs, will massively improve customer happiness around the world, and\nit's just fundamentally better all around. I mean, there are some pretty -- like we've been just like super\ndumb in some of the things we've done, where -- like, on one of the trips to China last year, I always\nask, \"Okay, what are we doing wrong? What can we fix?\" And like our China team is great, by the way.\nThey're like, \"Well, do you think we could have spare parts that are made in China just sent directly to our\nChina service centers?

Talk to us about that if you can. Number two, Elon, could you talk to\nus about -- can you talk about -- I hear you cut some workforce at SpaceX and there at Tesla and I feel\nthat you have a worry about global economy. Can you talk to us about how you feel about that with your\nguidance in order -- in the same order? And then can we talk about, maybe for the third thing, for JV, no\none's ever going to talk about stationary storage, but we got a whole page on that, which looked pretty\ngood to me, and what should we be focusing on that? And what can that add to the bottom line on top of\nthat $6 this next year?\nDeepak Ahuja\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nI mean, we can't really, Ben, talk about consensus and what that means. I think we are -- maybe the\nbetter approach is we are providing certain guidance here and you and the other analysts need to reflect\nthat in your modeling. And that's the best indication from the company of our projections. In all fairness,\nthat's the best way I can think of answering your question here.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes, J.B., is there anything you want to say?\nJeffrey B.

So I mean, we're\nexcited about it, but I can't say much more detail.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nI mean, our internal projections for stationary storage are closer to 3 gigawatt hours. But some of it\nis kind of lumpy and may not be completed this year. We would have done more in stationary storage\nlast year except we were cell-starved for vehicle production, so we had to convert a bunch of stationary\nstorage lines, battery lines, to vehicle battery lines.

I mean, I do think that the economy moves in cycles and there's clearly a significant risk of\na recession over the next 12 to 18 months, but I'm confident that Tesla will remain at least slightly\nprofitable, even with -- even if there is a significant recession. And then when -- and be all the stronger\nfor it when the recession ends. And the -- yes, we have to be relentless about cost in order to make\naffordable cars and not go bankrupt. That's what our headcount reduction is about, yes, yes. I think we\nhave to -- it's -- we have to be super hardcore about it. It's the only way to make affordable cars. The\n-- on the SpaceX side, the cost reduction was for a different reason unrelated to -- it was -- SpaceX has\nreally -- SpaceX has 2 absolutely insane projects that would normally bankrupt a company, the Starship\nand Starlink, and so SpaceX has to be incredibly spartan with expenditures until those programs reach\nfruition.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay, great.

Thank you, Elon. So my name is Zach Kirkhorn. Just a brief background\non myself. So I joined Tesla just under 9 years ago, when we were a super small company with a lot\nof potential ahead of us and I was attracted to the mission and the vision of the company. Throughout\nthat time, I've been deep in the operations of every major program of the company, from the Roadster\nto Model S and X, Model 3, scaling our energy business and more things to come, which we've talked\nabout on the call. I feel we're starting 2019 with a very strong financial foundation.
