"Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, our CTO; CFO, Jason Wheeler; and Jon McNeill, President of Global Sales, Service and Delivery. We will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ from these statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. We are happy to answer any questions you may have about Tesla's fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results. The webcast is available at the same link as the Q4 update letter, which includes GAAP and non-GAAP financial information and reconciliations between the 2.",neutral,0.7184044122695923,automobile
"Elon Musk: I think the newsletter probably speaks for itself, but I'll add some commentary on some of the lead points. We had a huge increase in Model S deliveries year-on-year in Q4 last year, going up 76%. And then we feel pretty good about where we're tracking to probably get close to 30% by the -- by about Q4 this year. And then something I'm personally quite excited about is that we expect to be positive cash flow starting next month and then continue on into Q2 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Elon. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect Thank you. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page where you came from. Back into the page you come from.",positive,0.8996899427910614,automobile
"The asset-backed line, which really I think is -- was accurately regarded as a slight decrease in the gross margin of the car by about roughly 0.1% or thereabouts. Apart from that, we're positive cash flow. And then we're expecting to be profitable for 2016 on a non-GAAP basis. I think this is going to be really well received and then getting into production and delivery at the end of next year. And -- but then nonetheless, despite the lease accounting stuff, we anticipate being profitable by GAAP standards in Q4 of this year. We're really looking forward to the -- building the Model 3 on -- at theend of next month. And I think the chart on vehicle demand is a good one.",positive,0.7291673719882965,automobile
"Tesla does not advertise. We don't pay for any endorsements. We do not discount our cars for anyone, including me. Whereas those actions are -- all of our competitors take those actions. We also have far fewer sales outlets than our competitors. Essentially, there's a lot of degrees of freedom that we are not exercising that we could, in theory, exercise. In Switzerland, we outsold the Mercedes S-Class, the BMW 7 Series, Porsche Panamera and the Audi 8 combined. And in Germany, weOutsold the PorschePanamera. So I think these are pretty interesting. I pay full retail price. I think -- oh, and if you look at the text, it's worth noting that this is not just uniquely true in the United States.",neutral,0.5075217634439468,automobile
"I'm super excited to be here, as excited as I was on the first day I walked through the door. We had over $67 million in Model X ramp-up costs and nonrecurring items in the quarter, as Elon mentioned. Correcting for these items, automotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits, would have been 25%. Jason, do you want to add anything? Jason S. Wheeler Sure, absolutely. Thanks, Elon. First of all, I look forward to working with everybody. I think they make a difference in accelerating the advent of electric vehicles. And it's really important to appreciate that incentives are an accelerant.",positive,0.9488508105278016,automobile
"The place is moving really fast, and we took some time, Elon talked about this in Q2 on the earnings call during the shutdown, putting better systems in place to track this. We're moving to a place where we're tracking E&O on a real-time basis and bringing those facts to the table when we're making decisions. So we shouldn't be in this position again. And when you add back the leasing proceeds that we get of $209 million, it's a great step change in the right direction to getting us to net cash flow positive. Also CapEx, we guided to $500 million last quarter on the call. We closed out at $411 million for the quarter. That all resulted in ending cash balance being at $1.2 billion, which I think showcases our strong improvement in cash management and discipline.",positive,0.6411299407482147,automobile
"Brian Arthur Johnson with Barclays PLC. First, can you kind of just refresh us given the change from the revolver to the ABL? What's the available borrowing base? How much of that is, as you think about next year, going to be used to support increased on-balance sheet leasing versus increases in finished goods inventory? And what's your remaining, if the banks were to come in kind of borrowing base that would be left unpledged? Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial Officer Yes, sure. So on where we closed Q4 at, I think we were $135 million fully drawn on it. And then in terms of the borrowing base, there's a lot of detailed numbers behind that. I think the most important thing to point out here is the increase to $1 billion that we did with our banking partners. There are some restrictions there, and we don't want to max that out. So we're going to monitor it carefully and just make sure we get the production we need. we need to get full production with Model X. It's sort of the work in process on the X.",neutral,0.7798872292041779,automobile
Elon Musk: We actually started on that early and launched the campaign in the second half of 2015 to reach out to folks who had cars coming off lease. And one of the attractive things to those folks who were coming off a lease is have a car that's equipped with Autopilot. It's really exciting. And so we're finding that folks are willing to upgrade their Tesla as part of this campaign.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer. Colin William Rusch: Can you talk a little bit about your preparations for that and your expectations on what will happen with those cars and how many of them are actually going to get returned?,positive,0.8543931841850281,autonomous driving technology
