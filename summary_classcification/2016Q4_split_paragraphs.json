But first of all, I'd like to announce that our CFO, Jason Wheeler, has decided to leave Tesla in April -- so it's at end of next month, to pursue opportunities in public policy. Jason will be replaced by Deepak Ahuja, who was Tesla's first CFO and worked for the company for more than 7 years before stepping away in 2015. Deepak will formally take over as CFO in early March and with Jason remaining at Tesla through April to entrust a smooth transition. And let's see, Jason, would you like to say anything? Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial Officer Yes, sure. First, Elon, thanks for the opportunity. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Thank you. Jason S.

Adam Michael Jonas Morgan Stanley, Research Division Yes. It has Tesla relevance. So just bear with me. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder I admire long-term thinking but impressive. Adam Michael Jonas Morgan Stanley, Research Division Well, numerous reports have suggested the new administration may be in favor of accelerating a mission to send humans to Mars. I'm curious if you think this is accurate in spirit. And if launched, how could this potentially change your balance of time spent between Tesla and SpaceX? Could it potentially change the rationale of keeping Tesla and SpaceX as independent companies? And this is a serious question, Elon. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Okay.

Tamberrino Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Curious as to what has changed on your end. Obviously, you've got -- made an acquisition. You've hired the individual in manufacturing from last year. But really moving from the Model S and X to the Model 3 ramp that you're looking for in the back half of 2017 here into 2018, how have you gone about the Model 3 development differently versus the Model S and Model X that will really be able to unlock the key to driving production much higher than what your previous ramps have looked like for new products? Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Right, the Model 3 is designed -- is really designed for manufacturing. It's considerably a simpler car than the S or the X. Some of these -- some modifications are obvious. For example, the Model 3 only has one screen, whereas the S and X have 2 screens and 2 separate computers powering each screen. The Model 3 has 1.5 kilometers of wiring. The Model S has 3 kilometers of wiring. So we simplified"

So we don't have self-presenting door handles, for example, or falcon wing doors. These reduce the risk substantially in a ramp and make it just easier to scale. And so I think it's going to be a very compelling car, but it's just -- it's a simpler design. And we also understand manufacturing a lot better than we did in the past. And we're also able to get usually the A team at the A supplier for Model 3. It's really that we're now able to get that, whereas for S and -- particularly for S and to some degree for X -- when we trying to get suppliers for Model S, a lot of the top-tier suppliers wouldn't even work with us, didn't believe the car, that the -- they thought we'd go bankrupt.

David J. Tamberrino Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Yes, okay. And then just following up on that as I think about reduced complexity of the vehicle, understood. From an actual line speed manufacturing perspective for the Model 3, what are you doing differently with the manufacturing process that is going to allow you to drive that ramp in production?

The -- there's just a lot more automation than there is for S and X. We have the Gigafactory, of course. That's a huge asset for factory, powertrain, power electronics, chargers and a few other things. So that's a huge asset and yes -- so -- but also we focused most of Tesla engineering, including design engineering, into designing the factory. The -- I think in the future, the factory will be a more important product than the car itself. I've said this before but we're -- our goal is to be the best manufacturer on earth. This is a real goal. I don't know if we'll succeed, but I think we're making good progress in that direction. And that's -- yes, it's really -- when you think of the factory, it's just an enormous product with at least [indiscernible] more complex than whatever it makes. J.B., anything you want to add?

So the amount of complexity in the operations to assemble the car is dramatically reduced. The amount of operations involved some level of sort of assembly craft, where there's more judgment of the operator. It's dramatically reduced, almost eliminated. And a lot of these things that we could identify directly as the bottlenecks that hurt us on the X ramp, we've been able to target specifically and reduce or eliminate. So that has -- though painful, it was a very helpful experience for us to get ready for Model 3. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes.

And as I mentioned on a prior call, the reality actually is that if electric vehicle incentives went away tomorrow, Tesla's competitive position would improve. It's probably why GM is able to sell the Volt at the price that they are able to do it while on paper, making a loss. It's that they -- their ZEV credits are worth only twice as much as they are for Tesla because they get the full retail value of their credits, which is worth about $10,000 more to them than it is to Tesla. We get basically 50 cents on the dollar when we can sell ZEV credits, which is not always. Last quarter, we were able to sell only a tiny amount of ZEV credits because that mandate is just already really weak. So the irony of getting rid of it would actually improve our competitive position. And ZEV credits only apply to 14 states in the"

Even in California, which is our home base, California legislature put an income cap on any one who could get the California tax credit for EVs, which then excluded a whole bunch of our customers, which I think is counterproductive to the biggest manufacturing player in California Why the hell the legislation? That, I do not know, but it was harmful to the state. Aileen Smith Okay, great. That's helpful. And then sort of a second question. You guys gave some helpful disclosure in terms of the vehicle order growth for the Model S and X in the quarter. Can you talk about the order growth for the Model 3?

Or is that going to take some time for that to ramp? Any color there? Elon R.

The only Model 3s will be like horribly negative margin, particularly on day 1, literally -- as in literally on day 1 because just on the -- at a tiny, tiny rate as you go up this giant machine. So it's just -- like no company on earth could -- there's no point for Tesla. It is like physically impossible.

Colin Langan UBS Investment Bank, Research Division So -- and that's next year that you should get to the 5,000 per week. Is that right? Elon R.

So SolarCity was actually a cash generator for the 5-week stub period. Some of that was the cash and the tax equity deals closing.

Just what are those agreements? Where does that liability show up on the balance sheet? And then is that a hard -- as soon they deliver a proof part, does that come due?

The other question is whether the\ntime [indiscernible] that stamping line will be here, it's going to be here in advance of the Model 3.

But it will all be here and\nit will be a hive of activity. And I'll be personally down there, looking at the line, as I was when we put\nthe Model S line and [indiscernible] that I don't think that's going to be an issue.

We try to model it out as carefully as possible, but there'll be things that aren't captured in the model and -- but I think in a lot of cases, we'll simply be able to run the lines faster as opposed to duplicate the line and that's like, by far, the best CapEx maneuver, is just to make it go faster but -- I would say it's going from 5,000 to 10,000 is probably -- it's a total wild ass guess.
