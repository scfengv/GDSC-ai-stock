"summary_text": "Elon Musk: Q4 was another strong quarter for the company. Deliveries reached over 112,000 vehicles in a single quarter.

"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: Starlink is really for high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity for homes and businesses. The antenna is sort of about the size of medium pizza, which you could put on a car, but I think it's more bandwidth than you would really need. Technically, you could buy one and just stick it on the car."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We're spending money as fast as we can, in sensible ways. The challenge comes in like finding efficient ways to actually deploy the capital. Zachary Kirkhorn: I think the math -- I'm not sure of the math that you've done, but I think our internal plans are faster."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: The demand is just far more than we couldreasonably make in the space of, I don't know, 3 or 4 years or something like that. So the thing we're going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity. We've got to really make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to improve the cost per kilowatt hour of the batteries."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We're not quite sure what's going to happen, but it is true that Model X -- the introduction of Model Xactually increased Model S sales because people would come in and look at the Model X. And we're worried aboutproduction, make sure we get that production ramp going and reach volume production as soon as possible with Model Y."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: The thing that's really going to, I think, probably just have a profound effect on our financials is high volume and high margin. And that high margin part comes from autonomy. The focus is on cost on the powertrain. And as weare close to Full Self-Driving, that's just going to become more and more compelling."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I think the product is better and better. That will increase the value. We don't want to really comment on prices and such. But I think it's probably fair at the moment to assume the mix of those 3 products is fairly stable in terms of ASP."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We're not aware of any one that we'd want to acquire. We've paid down $0.5 billion worth of debt last quarter. We're going to pay down the debt, just as time goes by. I don't think we have anything more to say on that front really."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We are super deep on cell, super deep, cell through battery, so cell \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 module battery. We've already demonstrated massive growth in cell production capacity at our Gigafactory in Nevada. And yes, we'll have more to talk about this in detail on Battery Day."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We're going to talk about this in Battery Day, which is probably April. I think it's going to be a very compelling story that we have to present. It's an important piece of the puzzle, yes. Some of the sort of retail investors have managed to put together several pieces of the. puzzle, they seem to have the most insight."
