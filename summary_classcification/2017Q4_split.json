        "paragraph3": "Before we jump to Q&A, Elon would like to have some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nRight, thank you. So 2017 was also a big year for Tesla. We launched the Model 3, which was our first\nmass production vehicle, and it's a huge step change for Tesla. A lot of challenges but I think we made\ntremendous progress on that front.\nWe also designed and installed and got into operation the world's largest battery in Australia, the largest\nbattery by a significant margin. And that battery is exceeding its performance targets significantly. We also\nunveiled the Tesla Semi, which is a super heavy-duty truck, maximum load semi truck, and the next-gen\nRoadster, which we believe will exceed gasoline sports cars on every dimension.\nAnd we also achieved record production and deliveries of Model S and X. And overall, I think, while\nthere were challenges associated with Model 3 ramp at the -- we were in a deeper level of hell than we\nexpected. So a few levels deeper than we'd like to be but swiftly exiting, I think. And so it's really, I\nthink, on balance, a phenomenal year. And I'd like to thank everyone at Tesla, who should be very proud\nof the work they've done. This is incredibly difficult. I'd like to thank everyone for their hard work and\ncontribution to 2017 being a really good year for Tesla.\nI also want to thank our suppliers, particularly those involved in Model 3, as they've shared the vertical\nstruggle we've had in ramping our production, and they've really burned the midnight oil, spent weekends\nand taking a lot of risks and suffered alongside us in the challenges associated with the ramp. So I'd like\nto thank them for supporting us through this difficult time with Model 3.\nAs well, our customers and Model 3 reservation holders, you're going to love your cars, and we are\nworking to get them to you as quickly as we possibly can. As for Model 3 production, we continue to make\nsignificant progress every day, and we are targeting a weekly production rate of 2,500 vehicles by the end\nof March and 5,000 by the end of Q2.\nAnd as what's been -- or you've seen in the letter, the quarter-over-quarter production of Model 3 is rising\nexponentially. So I hope we'll -- that people think that if we can send a Roadster to the asteroid belt, we\ncan probably solve Model 3 production. It's just a matter of time. So -- and really the error bars on the\ntiming are really quite small in the grand scheme of things.\nSo it's -- 2018 is likely to be a very big year for us. At some point in 2018, we expect to begin generating\npositive quarterly operating income on a sustained basis, operating 5,000 a week of Model 3 production.\nAnd I am cautiously optimistic that we will be GAAP profitable. It's not certain, but it's -- I'm cautiously\noptimistic that we will actually be GAAP profitable with no asterisk.TESLA, INC. FQ4 2017 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 07, 2018\nMartin Viecha\nThank you, Elon.

        "paragraph4": "I'm showing we have a question from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nCongratulations on the launch yesterday. Wanted to just ask a couple of questions. One is just to get a\nlittle bit more color from you on Model 3, what the production run rate is at the moment. Maybe if you can\njust provide us with a little bit more color on where the challenges are at this point? On the last call, you\ntalked about, I think, 2 of the 4 zones at Gigafactory that were still kind of an issue in manual operation.\nHave those been resolved? And once you get to 2,500, is the ramp to 5,000 -- does that just merely\ninvolve increasing line speeds?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nSure. I'll try to give as much color as possible. I am reminded of -- I think it may have been Churchill's\nline about sausage. If you like sausage and respect the law, you should watch neither being made. And\njust to me, that is true of a production ramp. So I wouldn't read too much into the day-to-day battles of\nthis or that, but I'll give you the color, but don't like -- don't read too much into it. So yes, there are 4\nzones in module production. Module production is fundamentally the limiting factor on Model 3 output,\nwhich is ironic since battery modules really should be the thing we're best at. And I think in part, we\nwere probably a little overconfident, a little complacent in thinking about this is something we know and\nunderstand and put a lot of attention on other things, not -- and just got too comfortable with our ability\nto do battery modules because we've been doing that since the start of the company. And of the 4 zones,\n2 of them, which is subcontracted to -- the production system is subcontracted to other companies, flat\nout, didn't work, it turns out. Like I mean, we were promised they would work, and it just didn't work. So\nwe had to do what would normally be maybe an 18-month development cycle for a production system of\nthat scale and complexity and tried to do that in basically 6 months, maybe a little -- 6 to 9 months. And\nwe've tackled that on multiple levels, so we have a design that is nearing completion for a new automated\nsystem for zone 1 and 2. That is being led by a Tesla ground team. It's an excellent design. All the other\nwork that they've done has been -- has performed to spec. And we expect a single Tesla ground line\nto be equivalent to 3, if not 4, of the current lines that we have and be smaller, which is, for me, kind\nof amazing. And then we have what we call a semiautomatic line, which is a series of small automated\nstations manned by people. And they've actually been remarkably effective. It has sort of renewed my\nfaith in humanity that the rapid evolution of progress and the ability of people to adapt rapidly has -- is\nquite remarkable. Our semiautomatic -- our sort of semi-manual, semiautomatic line is exceeding all 3 of\nthe automatic lines right now. So -- and that is something that we're able to scale quite rapidly. I mean,\nJ.B., is there additional color you'd like to add on that?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nSure, that's a great summary of it. I think much has been made about the manual production of modules.\nThat's really not very accurate. These are, as Elon said, semiauto lines where we have people there\nmoving materials perhaps between the machines that are actually performing the operations. But there is\nstill a degree of automation doing the operation.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nRight. It's not artisanal.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ4 2017 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 07, 2018\nExactly. And this is what has been ramping quite effectively in the last -- in the first half -- the first part of\nthis year. So we're continuing to expand that, the semiauto lines, and that is effectively bridging the gap\nas we redesign the full automation and bring that online.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. And it's pretty -- it's a small thing. So actually, I think it's probably worth providing some tours for\ninvestors that are interested, so you can actually see it first-hand. I think a lot of it is like if you see it\nfirst-hand, you will understand exactly what's going on. And so I think let's arrange for some new tours\nfor investors that are interested because I think you can really get a feel for what it is. Otherwise, it's just\nsome words that are kind of hard to put -- hard to imagine.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nI also just want to add, I think it's fair to say that this maybe degree of complacency that happened at the\nend of last year has been pretty thoroughly replaced by an intense focus from a huge portion of the Tesla\nteam. And there are a lot of different initiatives and teams, whole teams, targeted at this area. So as Elon\nopened with, it's not a question of if we will get to the production rate, it's just a question of the matter of\ntime.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, absolutely.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nIf I could just clarify, what's the run rate now with semiautomation? And when are you expecting the fully\nautomated line to come on?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nWell, it's probably a level of granularity that is not productive to dive into in terms of exactly what is\ncoming from which operation. But we do expect the new automated lines to be landing and starting out at\nthe Gigafactory in just the next -- well, the landing in sight within this quarter.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, expect the new automated lines to arrive next month, in March. And then it's already -- it's been\n-- it's working in Germany so that's going to tracked -- going to be disassembled, brought out to the\nGigafactory and reassembled and then go into operation at the Gigafactory. It's not of question whether\nit works or not. It's just a question of disassembly, transport and reassembly. So that's kind of -- yes. So\nwe expect to alleviate that constraint. That -- with alleviating that constraint, that's what gets us to the\nroughly 2,000 to 2,500 unit per week production rate. The next constraint would be material conveyance\nat our Fremont vehicle plant. And that's a very sophisticated automated parts conveyance system. We\nthink it's probably the most sophisticated in the world or at least we're not aware of one that is more so.\nAnd the software for that is quite complex. So that would be the next constraint on production to get to\n5,000, is the conveyance system in Fremont. So that also appears to be on track. So we feel like the error\nbars around the unit volume predictions are getting smaller with each passing week."

        "paragraph5": "And our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionTESLA, INC. FQ4 2017 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 07, 2018\nI also want to add my congrats for the launch yesterday. The twin Falcon landing was probably the\nsickest thing I've ever seen in my life. First question is for Deepak. Deepak, a question for you. Given\nthe negative trade cycle, your negative working cap, some of the modeling analysts are doing kind of\nsimulating when you get to 2,500 or 5,000 or maybe somewhere in between that, that some of the\narrangements you made with your suppliers who have been very helpful, that you might temporarily run\nenough negative working cap to even have operating cash flow exceed CapEx. Is that something that's\npossible? Or again, I know there's execution behind that clearly, but is that something out of the question\nor barely even?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nI think we got to look at it from a full quarter perspective. The negative working cycle is amplified by the\nrate at which we ramp our production. Given our present plans of getting to 5,000 by end of Q2, it's a\nfairly gradual -- it's exponential from where we started, but it's not going to create a situation where our\ncash flow from operations will exceed CapEx.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nAnd just as a follow-up, Elon, your kind of compensation -- long-term compensation plan obviously got\na lot of attention and raised some questions, however long term from now, on succession. Just want to\nask, do you see your successor as CEO of Tesla someone currently within the company right now or from\noutside the company? Kind of how do you see that?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI mean, there's no actual search going on or there's not even -- or passive -- active or passive search\ngoing on for a new CEO because I expect to remain CEO for the foreseeable future. But at some point,\nif there's somebody really spectacular inside or outside the company who could take on that role and\nwho'd want to have that title and that role, that would be fine with me. And I would focus on product\ndevelopment, which is designing and engineering, which is what I like doing best. So -- but there are no\nplans to make change at the time."

        "paragraph6": "Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Frank with Baird.\nTyler Charles Frank\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nI guess, Elon, bigger picture and looking out a few years, you had mentioned a couple of quarters ago that\nthe 1 million car target for 2020 was still there and that you would need to introduce the Model Y by then.\nHow do we connect from where we are today to getting to 1 million units a year? And what should we look\nfor this year in terms of ramping production or building a facility for the Model Y?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWe are going to make some capital investments towards the end of this year related to Model Y. I don't\nexactly count on those, but I think we've got a good plan. I'm pretty excited about the -- how we're\ndesigning Model Y. It's really taking a lot of lessons learned from Model 3 and saying how do we design\nthis thing to be easier to manufacture instead of how to manufacture, more difficult really. So I think it's\ngoing to be -- I really think it's going to be pretty great and pretty scalable for Model Y. But we are going\nto, as you suspect, need to make some capital investments in the second half of this year, really late,\nlate Q3, Q4 for Model Y. And -- but I think we want to wait until -- wait probably 3 to 6 months before\nannouncing any further plans on production location and the details associated with that.\nTyler Charles FrankTESLA, INC. FQ4 2017 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 07, 2018\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nIs that 1 million unit target still in play?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes.\nTyler Charles Frank\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nPerfect. And then just one quick follow-up. How should we think about the Tesla Semi and investments\nneeded there? And what are you guys thinking you can hit from an annual run rate in the next, let's say, 2\nto 4 years?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, a great difference between 2 and 4 years. Tesla -- I've said I think a few years ago, I think Tesla\nis going to kind of grow at an average of roughly 50% a year, which is a crazy average growth rate for a\ncompany manufacturing complex products at scale. So 2 versus 4 is a huge difference. But if you say like\n-- and it's much easier to predict, especially, this production, because they look like an S curve, where\nyou have an initial exponential, which -- the exponential appears -- it seems people naturally tends to\nextrapolate on a straight-line basis. An exponential always appears -- the predictions are conservative\nin the beginning, and then the exponential takes off, and then it becomes linear, and then it becomes\nlogarithmic. So it's easier to predict -- far easier to predict the endpoint or the steady state of the S-curve\nthan anywhere on that exponential -- or log curve. So if you say 4 years, I think 100,000 units a year is a\nreasonable expectation. Maybe more but that's the right -- roughly the right number, I think.\nTyler Charles Frank\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nFor the Tesla Semi?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. I think we might be able to exceed the specs that we unveiled last year too, which is pretty exciting.\nI know there's, like, speculation that we might not meet them, but I think we're going to exceed them.\nSo -- and I made this comment before. It's like -- feels like I gloss over these comments, but I really\ntake these to heart. The competitive strength of Tesla long term is not going to be the car. It's going to\nbe the factory. We're going to productize the factory. And really this is the lesson that is kind of obvious\nin history because the Model T wasn't a product. It was River Rouge. The Model T is a very simple car.\nAnybody could have made that car, but not anyone could make River Rouge. And that's really what would\nbe Tesla's long-term competitive advantage. We'll have a great lineup of great products, great design,\ngreat engineering the product itself in the vehicles and autonomy and all that sort of stuff. But the factory\nis going to be the product that has the long-term sustained competitive advantage, in my opinion."

        "paragraph7": "And our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nElon, on your autonomous vehicle strategy, why do you believe that your current hardware set of only\ncamera plus radar is going to be able to get you to fully validated autonomous vehicle system? Most every\ncompetitor noted that they need the redundancy from LIDAR hardware given the robustness of the 3D\npoint cloud and the data it's generated. What are they missing in their software stack and their algorithms\nthat Tesla's able to obtain from just a camera plus radar? Further, what would be your response if theTESLA, INC. FQ4 2017 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 07, 2018\nregulatory bodies require that level of redundancy and that's really needed from an incremental LIDAR\nhardware?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. Well, first of all, I should say there's actually a 3-sensor systems test. There are cameras, redundant\nforward cameras. There are -- there's the forward radar, and there's -- there are the ultrasonics for near\nfield. So a third is also -- a third set is also important for near field stuff just as it is for humans. But I\nthink it's pretty obvious that the road system is geared towards passive optical. We have to solve passive\noptical image recognition extremely well in order to be able to drive in any given environment and a\nchanging environment. We must solve passive optical image recognition. We must solve it extremely\nwell. At the point at which we have solved it extremely well, what is the point in having active optical,\nmeaning LIDAR, which does not -- which cannot read signs? It's just giving you -- in my view, it is a\ncrutch that will drive companies to a local maximum, that we'll find very difficult to get out of. If you take\nthe hard path of a sophisticated neural net that's capable of advanced image recognition, then I think\nyou'll achieve the goal maximum. And we combine that with increasingly sophisticated radar, and if you're\ngoing to pick active photon generator, doing so in 400 to 700-nanometer wavelength is pretty silly since\nyou're getting that passively. You would want your active photon generation in the radar frequencies of\napproximately around 4 millimeters because that is occlusion penetrating. And you can essentially see\nthrough snow or rain, dust, fog, anything. So it's just -- I find it quite puzzling that companies would\nchoose to do an active photon system in the wrong wavelength. They're going to get a whole bunch of\nexpensive equipment, most of which makes the car sort of expensive, ugly and unnecessary, and I think\nthey will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. Now perhaps I am wrong, in which case I'll look\nlike a fool. But I am quite certain that I'm not.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nOkay. And as a follow-up, if I may, can we talk about the trajectory for the Model S and X margins? 3Q\n'17, I think the company was saying you're in the low 20% range. I think you took another step down per\nthe report today, so I'm assuming it's probably at 20%. What's the path to recovery from here? And can\nyou frame us through how you're going to get to that margin expansion?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nWe feel very good about the recovery of S and X gross margin to -- in 2018 to a level which we have seen\nin the past. And it's a combination of a variety of things. It's increasing the mix of the larger batteries, the\nhigher option content. And then also we have a very good and a robust manufacturing cost reduction road\nmap. We will achieve a lot of manufacturing efficiencies which continue to occur on S and X, so we feel\nreally good about it.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. I mean, we -- our internal plan, whether we meet this or not, I don't know. But I think we will. Our\ninternal plan calls for turnaround of 30% to 32% cash gross margin on S and X by the end of the year and\nprobably 25%, maybe 26% GAAP gross margin on S and X towards the end of this year. And then Model\n3, maybe not by the end of this year but not far behind it.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nRight. And just as Elon said, internal road map and internal plans, things sometimes get delayed, they\ndon't work out exactly. But I think you get a sense that we feel really good about the improvement that's\nahead.\nElon R. MuskTESLA, INC. FQ4 2017 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 07, 2018\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, we have a clear path to that goal."

        "paragraph8": "Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.\nRomit Jitendra Shah\nNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division\nIt sounds like from the letter that you could do more than 100k S and X in '18 but you're constrained by\nthe 18650s. And I'm just curious, what would it take to see the 2170 cells in these vehicles?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nWell, this is J.B. It's something we've, of course, contemplated, but it's quite a large change to the\narchitecture of the module and the battery pack overall. And while the 18650 supply is somewhat of a\ncap at about 100k units per year, even just a few months ago, we didn't feel that expanding and making\nsome long-term bets on expanding that supply with Panasonic in Japan was really the right risk. It's\nsomething we could consider, but right now, we're pretty happy with that balance, and it matches our\nother production capabilities and our other investments.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, it's also like -- for any given complex manufactured item, in order to go past the target capacity,\nyou really need to move the whole supply chain in cadence. So you really have to then shift everything\nto say, okay, if you want to make 20% more S and X, everyone has to make 20% more, there have to\nbe investments in new lines or it's going to require overtime, which negatively affects gross margins.\nWe [ didn't ] design the manufacturing machine for it [ to break ], and then you'd have to redesign the\nmachine or go redline. And so I think we feel pretty good about the 100k a year for S and X, and we want\nto focus on just improving the efficiency of production and the gross margin of the group.\nRomit Jitendra Shah\nNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division\nOkay. Yes, makes sense...\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\n[ Keeping, of course, ] the Model 3. I mean, that's really where the majority of the effort is.\nRomit Jitendra Shah\nNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division\nOkay. The other thing you guys mentioned was upcoming autonomous coast-to-coast drive, which we're\nreally looking forward to. Could you give a little bit more color on time frame, when something like that\nwould be available for customers?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. So we actually -- I've been meaning to address this but -- because obviously, I missed the mark on\nthat front. Our focus is very much on Model 3 production, so everything else kind of took a second place\nto that. But the -- we could have done the coast-to-coast drive, but it would have required too much\nspecialized code to effectively game it or make it somewhat brittle in that it would work for one particular\nroute but not be a general solution. So [ although ] you would be able to repeat it, but just not any other\nroute, which is not really a true solution. I am pretty excited about how much progress we're making\non the neural net front. And it's a little -- it's also one of the things that's kind of exponential, where theTESLA, INC. FQ4 2017 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 07, 2018\nprogress doesn't seem like -- it doesn't seem like much progress, it doesn't seem like much progress,\nthen suddenly, wow. That's been my observation generally with AI stuff. And you look at, say, something\nlike what people at DeepMind did with AlphaGo. It went from not being able to beat even a pretty good\nGo player to something that could beat the European champion, then it could beat the world champion,\nthen it could thrash the world champion, then it could thrash everyone simultaneously. Then they made\nAlphaZero, which could thrash AlphaGo, where it's just winning against itself, was better than all the\nworld's human experts. It's kind of going to be like that for self-driving. It will seem like, well, this is a\nlame driver, lame driver, like, okay, that's a pretty good driver, like, holy cow, that driver is good. It will be\nlike that. I mean, timing-wise, I think we can probably do a coast-to-coast drive in 3 months, 6 months at\nthe upside.\nRomit Jitendra Shah\nNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division\nAnd then is it available for customers immediately? Or is there a lag?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, that would be something that's available for customers. [ We currently have done it, do tests on it ]."

Brinkman\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nAs you put solutions in place one by one to unclog Model 3 production bottlenecks in Fremont or at\nthe battery module line in Reno, are you finding that the ultimate solution is more or less expensive to\nimplement than your original plans, which called for a 25% gross margin on the vehicle? Do you feel any\ndifferently now about the cost to manufacture the Model 3 or its gross margin potential versus prior to the\nstart of production last July?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI think we feel good about that. I think we're probably able to exceed that next year, probably. Like,\nour understanding of manufacturing has improved dramatically. We can think of a huge number of\nways to make it far better, far more efficient. I'm really excited about how much we're learning about\nmanufacturing.

Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. Maybe just to add to that, I mean, the products bill of materials cost and the embedded labor cost is\n-- I think, that's where there's opportunities. And we are simplifying and we're finding ways to improve the\ndesign incrementally as we go through the ramp. If there is some small increases in CapEx, that doesn't\ndirectly -- it will be overwhelmed by the improvements in simplicity and some cost savings in the product\nitself.\nElon R.

Is that less of a\nmedium-term focus as you prefer to invest operating cash flows from the Model 3 into the Semi truck,\nRoadster and Model Y?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. We could be positive cash flow, I think pretty significant positive cash flow probably in like third\nquarter, which is like 4, 5 months from now. But we think it makes sense to invest in Model Y and -- yes.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nFuture growth of our energy products, Model 3, future growth of that so...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, the opportunities we see are -- we see really good opportunities there.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. It makes good business case and business sense to invest.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. Silver bullets for me, in fact, can't emphasize enough. And what I find sort of interesting is that our\ncompetitors -- well, the car industry thinks they're really good at manufacturing. And they're actually\n-- they are quite good at manufacturing, but they just don't realize just how much potential there is for\nimprovement. It's way more than they think. I went through this math, I think, on a prior earnings call,\nbut like it sounds like some of the -- the fastest car factories produce a car maybe every 25 seconds. It\nsounds fast. But if you think about a 5-meter long car including gap, a 4.5-meter car with 0.5 meter gap\nor something, that's only 0.2 meters per second. Like grandma with a walker can beat the speed of the\nfastest production line on earth. So really not that fast. Walking speed is 1 meter per second, so 5x faster\nthan the fastest production line on earth. Why? It should at least be jogging speed. I mean, in the limit,\ncompanies should start caring about the aero drag in the factory, which -- that's maybe around 20 or 30\nmiles an hour or \"30 kilometers an hour, 40 kilometers an hour.\" It's like stuff should be moving at that\nspeed."

        "paragraph10": "And our next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nYou commented in the shareholder letter that capital expenditures for 2018 were expected to be a bit\nhigher than 2017. I'm wondering if you could tell us what exactly is in that, call it, roughly $3.5 billion. Are\nyou going to get to full like 10,000 car per week capacity? Is that in the $3.5 billion? What will Gigafactory\nproduction be? And in the slightly more than $3.4 billion, is that also including the investments, Elon, that\nyou mentioned on Model Y? So where exactly is this level of capital spending going to take us in 2018?\nAnd I have a follow-up, please.TESLA, INC. FQ4 2017 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 07, 2018\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nSure, I mean, our biggest -- at a very high-level sort of breakdown, our biggest investment is obviously\nin the Model 3. And that includes completion of the payments that we still have to make on the capacity\nwe are putting in place now as well as significant investment in -- or required upfront for the next phase\nof Model 3 production to 10,000-plus per week. So that's, I would say, overall more than 50%, really\nmore than 50% is Model 3. And the rest is all the many other things we talked about, whether it's energy\nstorage, whether it's...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nPrimarily Y and energy storage.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nRight. And then our infrastructure spend, superchargers, stores, service centers. We want to significantly\nincrease the service capacity, want to significantly increase our supercharging capacity. So all of those\npieces then add up to the total spend.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. The -- just to give you some sort of flavor for our optimism on Model Y, I think. Model Y, I think, we\nmight aim for something like maybe capacity of 1 million units a year, something like that, just for Model\nY alone. And I think we'll be able to do that for CapEx that is less than the Model 3 CapEx at the $0.5\nmillion. So probably -- I think we can probably improve CapEx by a factor of 2. It's not a promise, but\nthat's my gut feel on Model Y CapEx, just to give you a flavor for my level of optimism on improvements\non the manufacturing front.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nThat's helpful. And just so is the $3.5 billion and the greater than 50% to Model 3, is that going to\ncomplete all the required equipment to get us to 10,000 a week at the end of the year? Or are we still\ngoing to have incremental capital expenditures? And then separately, on my second question around\nModel 3 gross margins, I think you had said that you expected them to be breakeven this quarter.\nObviously, volume was lower, and so you didn't get there. But for next quarter, you're suggesting that\nthey're going to be negative again despite the fact that I think Q1 volumes are much higher than what you\nwould have anticipated originally for Q4 when you thought that margins would be breakeven. So can you\nhelp reconcile the apparent enthusiasm you have about the gross margin trajectory with the fact that your\nguidance around gross margins in the near term actually appears more cautious than it was guided at the\ntime?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nCan you hear us?\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nYes, I can hear you.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, no worries. Yes, to sort of finish off your first part of the question, no, we will still have further\ninvestments in the 10,000 per week capacity of the Model 3 happening next year as all of that will beTESLA, INC. FQ4 2017 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 07, 2018\nconcluded next year. There's always a lag in our cash outflow while we continue to test the equipment\nand verify it. So that'll continue in '18 -- in '19. And then in terms of the Model 3 gross margins, our\nexpectations earlier were of a much steeper ramp than what we are projecting here. We were targeting,\nas you well know at one point, hitting 5,000 by the end of '17. And now that's 6 months later. So -- but\nthat's slower ramp. We just know we'll have inefficiencies. We have the full capacity, so the depreciation of\nall that equipment and the operating costs are hitting while we're not producing as many cars. It's actually\npretty simple. And it's only temporary. It doesn't imply anything fundamental.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, exactly. The problem is like when you've got a machine where most of that machine, I mean that\noverall production and supply chain machine, is at a 5,000-unit capacity but then 10% or 15% of it isn't,\nthen you got this massive load on a small -- on a way smaller production volume. Then as that production\nvolume -- as you fix that remaining 10% or 15% of the production machine, you're able to get to that\ntarget production, and then things improve dramatically. It's sort of like having a car that's operating at\na fraction of its -- let's use a gas-themed analogy. We've got a 4-cylinder car operating on 1 cylinder. It's\nlike, okay, it's not so great, one full -- or suppose it is -- machines were -- it's just like a big machine\nessentially, yes."

In the past, Mr. Musk, you\nhave spoken about supercapacitors as a way of generating energy and/or storing energy. And particularly\nin the application of heavy trucks, I would expect that the surge of energy in slowing down or braking in\nthe truck would be too much for a battery to absorb. Are you considering supercapacitors as an application\nfor the Semi? Or what is your kind of general thought on that technology, and the implications to make\nthat industrially viable?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. I mean, ages ago, I was going through basically applied physics and computer science degree,\na Ph.D. in capacitors. So I'm a big fan of capacitors. I just don't think -- I think that the lithium ion\nchemistry is so good at this point that capacitors will not be needed. There's a certain power-to-energy\nratio, and once you have a huge amount of energy, which is needed for range, then you automatically\nhave the power you need for absorbing -- for being able to do rapid acceleration and braking.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. It's maybe not intuitive, this is J.B., but the power-to-energy demand on the battery in the heavy\ntruck is actually generally less than in our sort of performance vehicles. It's definitely less also, in most\ncases, than even the high rate of discharge energy products. So as Elon said, you have a lot of energy, so\nyou end up with a lot of power, actually more than you need.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. And the way that chemistry works is that you're able to actually extract, for short periods of time,\nextract very high power from lithium ion cells as you sort of have ion migration right on the surface. And\nthen the sustained power for lithium ion is conservatively less than the power over, say, the course of\nseveral seconds or minute. But the several seconds power for lithium ion is remarkably good because\nyou're essentially using ion migration from the outer surface. It's like if you have a parking lot, all the carsTESLA, INC.

I'd like to talk, follow-up a little bit on the first question around some of the manufacturing roadblocks\nas well as the comment about building a machine to build the machine, which I believe was the title of a\n1990 MIT book about Toyota. Could you maybe give us some more discussion really on the managerial\nculture, the process level, how you would benchmark yourself, for example, against the Toyota factory,\nwhich seems to be able to launch new product in about 3 or 4 months, to ramp up? Or at the other\nextreme, because I know Mr. Field came from there, kind of what Foxconn does in its goal to replace\nhumans? But in particular, talk about the managerial processes, not so much the robots you're putting into\nplace.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, I'm pretty sure Toyota cannot ramp up any of their products in 3 months. In fact, I'm 100% certain\nabout that. Deepak spent many years at Ford before joining Tesla.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. I mean, generally, companies including Toyota take anywhere from 6 months to a year when they\ncome up with an all new product.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nAnd all new is like that's -- there's still -- it's not really -- the amount of technology that changes, not that\nmuch.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nIt's a major platform so it's not all new as a Model S or an X that we've done.

But within that then, what are the differences though in the way you're going to be managing the\nfactory?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nThe most fundamental difference is thinking about the factory as -- really as a product, as a quite\nvertically integrated product.\nJeffrey B.

Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes -- we don't think so.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nI think that generally, it's treated more as an optimized operational problem, being extremely lean and\nreally managing the flows of materials and the supply chain. They're great at it, but this is, I think, a\ndifferent approach, looking at it really from deep technical lens in terms of automation, robotics, process.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. Imagine like if the Model S was -- or the way you design a Model S, design your factory like it's a\ncar. You still have a lot of workers. You still have a lot of people. I mean, just like with Model S, say, we\nhave a large service organization. There's scheduled maintenance. There are things that break. There are\ncrashes that need to be repaired. There are technology upgrades. But you don't actually ship people with\nthe Model S. That would be weird. That's not like hanging people in the car. So you have -- we expect that\nthe Tesla factory has people -- a lot of people around the factory but very few people in it.\nJohn Douglas Field\nSenior Vice President of Engineering\nI also think that the degree with which we have -- this is Doug. The degree with which we have product\ndevelopment and manufacturing development integrated is unique. And Model 3 already is a dramatically\nsimpler car to build than the Model S. And even many people in operations who have worked their career\nin volume manufacturers say the Model 3 is a huge step forward from anything that they've built. So as\nwe go forward, Elon mentioned Model Y, a big part of our manufacturing capability is going to come from\nhow simple we make our products.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nAnd how do you manage the people in the interim?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, it's actually [indiscernible] thing. It came from -- you have Apple and then Ford -- Ford and then\nApple.\nJohn Douglas Field\nSenior Vice President of Engineering\nYes, the model at Foxconn was very different where very quick product ramps and very high scale was\nachieved through manual processing of also what is fundamentally a product whose simplicity is orders of\nmagnitude below ours. And iPad is less complicated than our center screen in many ways. So it's a very\ndifferent order of magnitude in terms of the kind of product you're building, and it's extremely manual\nbecause that is the way that you have to ramp very quickly and then end the life of our product and bring\nup a new one.\nElon R.

Do you have enough experience with production of the Model 3 outside of the issues\nyou're facing in the Gigafactory that you're confident once those problems are solved, you can get up and\nrunning? Or is there sort of a contingency here that once you get that worked out, you'll be ramping up\nin 3 months, and there might be some other hurdles that are discovered? I'm just trying to understand if\nthere are some -- any incremental kinks that might come in the production process as you ramp up. And\nthen also as we think about the step from 5,000 to 10,000, is that something that can be done inside the\nFremont factory? It sounds like you're confident that your density is much higher than what even Toyota\nand GM were producing out there potentially on capacity. But just curious on those 2 [ things ].\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. There's really -- there are only 2 things that I'm aware of that are constraints in production of\nany significance: the module being the most significant; and then the parts conveyance, basically, the\nautomated conveyance system that brings parts to the lines. The way the Fremont factory is set up\nis that there's actually, on the ground floor, we actually created 2 levels. The bottom level is all parts\nconveyance, so parts coming from the warehouse where the parts are sort of automatically sorted and\nthen are transferred through an automated conveyance system all the way to the line on the conveyance\nsystem being on the ground floor and then raised up to the line, which is actually on kind of an artificial\nmezzanine. And I think we can get 10,000 vehicles a week out of Fremont without a significant -- without\ncreating really any new buildings of significance in the existing space. We will need to bring up the south\npaint shop, which is what we actually were using for S and X paint, and so we upgraded north paint to\ndo S, X and 3. But with relatively small CapEx, way less than we spent on north paint, we're comfortable\nwe can bring south paint up to achieve the approximately 600,000 vehicles per year rate to combined\n100,000 S and X, 500,000 3, which would be 20% to 30% more than Toyota and GM produced in the\nsame facilities. And we're a lot more vertically integrated as well.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nLiterally and figuratively, right?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, [ exactly ].\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nJust as we think about that though, Elon, is that sort of an asymptotic limit in that plant? Or based on\nwhat you're really talking about, could you get more out of that plant? Or as we look at the Model Y and\nthere's million units capacity, we're definitively looking at a new facility?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderTESLA, INC. FQ4 2017 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 07, 2018\nI'm pretty excited about the Model Y stuff, and I think I want to present that in a more cohesive fashion.\nAnd it's probably not the next earnings call but call it 6 months from now. But I'm really excited about the\nModel Y manufacturing and the design manufacturing. Like essentially, how do we design out all the pain\nthat we're currently going through? We do not want to experience it again. It's just really a lot of pain. The\npain level is extremely high. I mean, I was in the factory -- I was in the Gigafactory on Thanksgiving Day\nas were many other Tesla people. It's like it's hardcore, okay? Seven days a week, don't have a vacation.\nSo we don't want to repeat that.\nJohn Douglas Field\nSenior Vice President of Engineering\nThe material flow delivery Elon mentioned as we develop very high density and velocity lines, the limit\nstarts to become how we get material to that line. We'll solve that for the Model 3 line. But eventually,\nwithin Fremont, the limit to production may be how many trucks we can get in, how quickly, of material, in\norder to build cars.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nYou'd use the Hyperloop for that.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. Actually, we are looking at building tunnels using The Boring Company or something because we\nhave, for example, our seats production is at a separate building on Page. And we have a bunch of trucks\nmoving seats back and forth between the primary Fremont production and the seat factory. And we\nactually get constrained on how many trucks can we dock at the -- dock and undock at the seat factory,\nwhich is only 0.5 mile or 1 mile away from the vehicle plant. So it'll be pretty easy to just have a tunnel,\ndoing automated conveyance probably from seats to the factory. And there are, I mean, things we can do\nwhere we can build subsystems and then transport subsystems to Fremont. These things get increasingly\ndifficult, but they're all doable. But I can see a path where we get to, say, 600,000 Model 3 production and\n100,000 S and X, so maybe 700k. We should be like almost 50% more than GM and Toyota get out of the\nplant. I think that seems achievable.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nCan I just sneak one in for Deepak? I apologize. You did a great job of working capital in the quarter.\nI mean, I think some of us might kind of throw stones and say it might not be repeatable. But you did\nit, you got the cash in the door. So it's done and it was -- you did some pretty good work here. How\nrepeatable do you think the benefit from working capital is going forward? I mean, is this really just the\nbenefit of negative working capital and as you ramp up, you'll get this cash inflow? And then also as we\nlook at the customer deposits and the ZEV credits, those were 2, I think, apparently large cash inflows. I\nmean, how repeatable do you think those are in the future as well?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. Some of those are not repeatable. We significantly reduced the finished goods inventory of S\nand X in Q4, which will not repeat itself going forward. And that was a huge impact to our working\ncapital. Customer deposits may not be as well, as you pointed out. However, the -- as the Model 3 ramp\ncontinues, the negative working capital needs for that, which essentially creates extra cash for us, will be\nrepeatable. And we'll continue to keep very tight controls on our accounts receivables and everything else\nwe do to manage cash to make sure we are being efficient.\nMartin Viecha\nThank you very much.

I'm just wondering, it had been several quarters ago kind of\npre Model 3 questions we're hearing more about software you were rolling out to existing customers. Just\nwondering if you can give us some color on what level of uptake you're seeing. And I would imagine we're\nnot seeing that in the upfront Model S and X margins, but potentially, there are some sort of -- those are\nvehicles that are earning assets for you in the future sort of customer ownership. So if you could kind of\ntalk a little bit about what trends you're seeing there or elaborate a little bit on that, that would be helpful.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. I think probably the biggest item is as we get the software right, people upgrading to full self-driving\ncapability of S and X, and anything with Hardware 2, which is like the 8 cameras, more advanced op\nsights and improved compute capability, I think, will be capable of the full self-driving. The full self-driving\n-- the Hardware 2 set is also capable of doing an easy swap out of the computer. So if it turns out we\nneed additional computing capability to meet the regulatory standards for self-driving -- particularly like\nwe think with the current compute hardware, we can get to better than human. But the standard for\nregulators may be that you need to be 5x better than human or something like that. But we believe that is\nsolvable purely with compute hardware. And it would be a relatively minor expense to do that. So I think\nprobably that's the biggest opportunity.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd along the same lines, not all customers pay for enhanced autopilot too, and as people hear more, we\ncan see an uptick on that. But it's all around autopilot, to your point.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, exactly. And that -- some of the sort of semiautomated driving definitely doesn't require any\nhardware upgrades than that $5,000, that's essentially a software product with 0 cost -- 0 marginal cost\nand so it's 100% margin. And then where full self-driving is available, we can probably -- that's more than\na $3,000 increment. It's maybe a $5,000 increment or something like that.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\nIs there any data you can provide us though today in terms of the percentage of consumers that are\nupgrading or opting in, just to get a sense of kind of the order of magnitude that, that -- what that\nbusiness could look like over time?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, well, not many people are opting in at this time.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, the full self-driving system doesn't actually work. Essentially, people are buying an option on it\nworking in the future. So that's a very [ nice ] thing, [ that the prices ] are very low. There's also the\nautomation part, things that we expect to operate kind of a shared autonomy fleet, where it has like --TESLA, INC. FQ4 2017 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 07, 2018\nkind of like combination of Uber or Lyft and Airbnb, I guess, where you can opt to have your car enter\na shared fleet or not, and then Tesla can also operate its own fleet in places where there's not enough\npeople sharing their vehicles.
