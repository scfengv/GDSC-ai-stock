        "paragraph": "Instructions]\nElon, I'll turn it over to you.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nAll right. Thank you. The -- I think the most important point here that we want to make is that we're\nadvancing the Q3 -- I'm sorry, the Model 3 build plan substantially. So -- and just overall -- the overall\nvolume plan, with Tesla aiming get to the 0.5 million unit per year run rate in 2018 instead of 2020. And\nthis is based off of the tremendous demand we see for the Model 3, which I think is actually a fraction\nof the ultimate demand when people fully understand what the car's capable of and are able to do a test\ndrive. So this is probably the biggest change strategically.\nI think also, Tesla is going to be hell-bent on becoming the best manufacturer on earth. So the -- thus far,\nI think we've done a good job on design and technology of our products. The Model S and X, I think, are\ngenerally regarded by very critical judges as technologically the most advanced cars in the world. And so\nthe -- I think, we've done well in that respect.\nThe key thing we need to achieve in the future is to also be the leader in manufacturing. So we take\nmanufacturing very seriously at Tesla. It's the thing that we need to obviously solve if we are going to\nscale and scale rapidly and make the cars more affordable. So that's -- I really want to sort of send the\nmessage out there to those -- to the best manufacturing people in the world, we want you to come join\nour company. And that is going to be the primary focus of Tesla is how do we get super good at making\nlarge, complex objects.\nSo that's the -- I think, the most salient point. It's easy to get wrapped up in like a bunch of sort of short-\nterm issues, but I think in terms of what matters in the future, I think that's the most significant thing.\nOverall, on the short-term stuff, our quarter-over-quarter stuff, I think, has improved quite significantly.\nObviously, Model X production increased by a factor of 5 from Q4 to Q1, and we continue to make huge\nstrides in volume and quality of the vehicle. And I'm personally spending an enormous amount of time\non the production line. My desk is at the end of the production line. I have a sleeping bag in a conference\nroom adjacent to the production line, which I use quite frequently. The whole team is super focused onTESLA, INC. FQ1 2016 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 04, 2016\nachieving rate and quality and at the target cost. So that's -- I feel very confident in us achieving that\ngoal.\nAnd with the increase in ramp, we do feel comfortable affirming the 80,000 to 90,000 deliveries this year.\nSo that's -- yes, I think what -- it's just the rate of improvement with each passing day is very significant.\nAnd let's see, finally, I'd like to sort of thank Greg Reichow, who was our head of production, for\ntremendous contribution over the last 5 years. Greg is still -- contrary to some media reports, Greg is\nstill at Tesla. He's still with the company, and he's helping with the transition to sort of -- to some new\nleadership. And we have some, I think, exciting announcements coming in the next -- possibly in the next\nfew weeks about additions to the Tesla management team on the productions side.\nSo that -- I'm feeling really, really excited about where things are heading in that direction.\nWith that, let's go to questions.TESLA, INC.

        "paragraph": "Instructions] Our first question comes from James Albertine of Stifel.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\nThere's no doubt you have an incredible undertaking in front of you. Can you help us understand some of\nthe key obstacles and how we should consider those obstacles between now and your anticipated launch\nof the Model 3 in late 2017, whether it's sort of P&L adjustments that we need to make along the way? But\ncan you just help us sort of choreograph how that's going to take place?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nSure. So with the Model 3, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we're really try to take a lot of\nlessons learned from Model X, where -- Model X, we put a lot of bells and whistles on Model X and a lot\nof advanced technologies that weren't necessarily for version 1 of the vehicle. With Model 3, we're being\nincredibly rigorous about ensuring that we don't have anything that isn't really necessary to make a very\ncompelling version 1 of the car. We also have a much tighter feedback loop between design engineering,\nmanufacturing engineering and production. And so no element of Model 3 can be approved unless\nmanufacturing has said that this is easy to manufacture and that the risks associated with manufacturing\nit is low. There are many ways to skin a cat, and it's remarkable how you can achieve the same objective\nwith a hugely varying degree of difficulty. You can sort of take the analogy and say, if you want to kill a\nfly, you can kill a fly with a thermal nuclear weapon, with a MOAB, with a cruise missile, with a machine\ngun or a flyswatter. So the end result is the same, but the difficulty is considerably more significant from\none to the other, and the collateral damage is considerably more significant. So having that -- having\nproduction be really fundamental to the design of the Model 3, I think, is very important. And making sure\nwe're not adding extraneous features to the 3 that aren't necessary to achieve the production volume is\nalso extremely important. I'm not going to -- at the risk of this being misinterpreted, and probably there\nwill be some number of articles that do, I think it's worth explaining sort of how manufacturing a complex\nobject with several thousand unique components actually works and what dates are relevant. And it's --\nwhat -- in order to achieve volume production of a car -- a new car with several thousand unique items,\nyou actually have to set a target date internally and with suppliers that is quite aggressive. And that is\na date that is taken -- that has to be taken seriously. So like, the date -- because I'm sure this will leak.\nIt's hard to keep a secret, really. The date we are setting with suppliers to get to a volume production\ncapability with the Model 3 is July 1 next year. Now will we actually be able to achieve volume production\non July 1 next year? Of course not. The reason is that even if 99% of the internally produced items and\nsupplier items are available on July 1, we still cannot produce the car, because you cannot produce a car\nthat is missing 1% of its components. Nonetheless, we need to work internally and with suppliers to take\nthat date seriously, and they need to see some penalties for anyone, internally or externally, who does not\nmeet that time frame. The -- that -- this is just -- this has to be the case because there's just no way that\nyou have several thousand components, all of whom make it on a particular date. So the reality is that the\nvolume production will then be some number of months later as we solve the supply chain and internal\nproduction issues. But it is a bit of a confusing thing, and it is -- it does create some churn, because\npeople are like, \"Well, what's the real date?\" It's like you have to take the July 1 date seriously in order for\nsome date a few months later or some number of months later to actually be the real date. So yes, that's\nactually how it has to work. So in order for us to be confident of achieving volume production of Model 3\nby late 2017, we actually have to set a date of mid-2017 and really hold people's feet to the fire internally\nand externally to achieve an actual volume production date of late 2017. So as a rough guess, I would say\nwe would aim to produce 100,000 to 200,000 Model 3s in second half of next year. That's my expectation\nright now. Yes, so that's the thing. And now, what I would say to anyone that is thinking about ordering a\nModel 3, now is a good time to actually place your reservation or place your order because you don't have\nto worry about if you're placing your order and receiving it 5 years from now. If you place your order now,TESLA, INC. FQ1 2016 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 04, 2016\nthere's a high probability you will actually receive your car in 2018. So it's -- I'd really recommend that\nanyone who wants to receive their car in 2018 place their order very soon.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\nElon, if I may, as a follow-up, can you give us some reference as to -- again, most generously, you would\nthink if you said end of fourth quarter or -- you said fourth quarter of 2017, so that's 6 months at its most\ngenerous calculation. How does that compare with the volume production-agreed date for the Model X,\njust as an example? And then how does this flow with your cash needs? As you've articulated, it seems\nyou've walked back a little bit from the prior quarter's discussion around cash flow positive and no need\nfor capital markets raise. It seems like there may be a need here. If you could just articulate how the 2 fit\ntogether, that'd be helpful.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nIt's always tempting for people to reason by analogy instead of first principles, and that's what -- that\nwould be the mistake of assuming that anything to do with the X production has bearing on Model 3.\nThey're very different programs with fully different approaches. So I would not try to extrapolate from\nthat any more than it would have made sense to extrapolate from the Roadster when we were making\n600 cars a year to 20,000 cars a year with the Model S. So in the Roadster case, we went from making\n600 cars a year in 2010, where Lotus made the body and chassis, we made the powertrain and we did\nfinal assembly. It was a far simpler car than the Model S. I would tell people we were going to do 20,000\n-- get to a run rate of 20,000 cars a year with the Model S, despite it being a vastly more complicated\ncar and a car where we made the whole car, not just the powertrain. If you would extrapolate from the\nRoadster experience, you would be completely wrong about the Model S outcome, and many people were.\nThat's why it's -- I would say, X is not relevant. As far as the increased capital raise, well, obviously, if you\ndouble your planned volume, you can't expect the capital to stay the same. I think our capital efficiency\nwill actually improve on a per-car basis, but obviously, it can't stay the same.",

And there's -- we're\nadding world-class aces in production with each passing week. It is a huge advantage to have the most --\nI mean, what -- I think it's better to say it's probably the most compelling product program in the world\nwith the Model 3. I'm not sure what would be more compelling -- at least, I think that there's a good\nargument that Model 3 is the most compelling program on earth, so -- from a manufacturing standpoint.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2016 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 04, 2016\nSo I believe to recruit top manufacturing talents to the most compelling product on earth is very strong.\nWe find the response to be extremely good when we call people up. So based on the rate at which we're\nadding world-class manufacturing expertise and some of the things that I know we're going to announce\nin the future, I feel highly confident that Model 3 is going to be well executed as a program. And yes,\nthat's -- you wanted to add something, J.B.?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. If I might just add, I mean, you've mentioned this briefly before, but the design of the vehicle lends\nitself to high-volume production very efficiently. And I think that's really...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, designed for manufacturing.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nAbsolutely. And that's something we're doing even today. Those designs are firming up. So this is\nsomething happening far, far ahead of time. And the second point would be the quality and the motivation\nof the suppliers involved in the program is best ever.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, it's massively increased, yes. I mean, every supplier wants to be in this program.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nGot it. And if I could just ask a follow-up, I mean, obviously, cost is going to be an important factor when\nthe 3 launches. I think you've indicated that your battery cost with PACCAR now, under $190 per kilowatt-\nhour. How do think that compares to the industry? Where do you think it'll be by the time the Model 3 is\nlaunching, since the launch, it seems, is a little slower?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, we're trying to comment on an individual component costs, and that's stuff's fairly proprietary. It's\nkind of giving away our playbook. So -- but I think it's pretty obvious that we will exceed anyone else\nin the world in scale economies with the Gigafactory, and we're very confident in Panasonic's ability to\nexecute on that front. So I just don't know anyone who, in terms of intrinsic costs, is going to be close to\nwhat the Gigafactory could produce on a cost-per-kilowatt-hour basis.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nAnd any color, when you think the $190, how much like a CAGR of decline until the Gigafactory's\n[indiscernible] the 30% [indiscernible] once that's online?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI -- yes. Next question.",

Inc., Research Division\nAs you look at this accelerated plan for production, what can we expect on OpEx spending to support all of\nthose cars coming out a lot faster than you had previously expected?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, this is Jason. I think we updated our guidance on OpEx for the year a little bit in the letter. We had\ntalked about 20% last year and moving that range to 20% to 25% for 2016. So there's obviously going to\nneed to be more OpEx at this. However, at the same time, you see how we improved quarter-over-quarter\nin terms of OpEx. We were down $12 million from Q4, down 3%. So there's a renewed focus in the halls\nhere at Tesla on making sure we are managing costs extremely effectively. And all of our employees get\nthat and are contributing to that.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. I mean, I think it's -- our sort of operating leverage, I mean, just sort of fixed costs relative to our\nvariable costs has been improved dramatically as you get volume up.\nJason S.

Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. I mean, my desk has frequently been in the factory, so this is not some new thing. On the Model S\nramp, my desk was also in the middle of the factory at the start of the body line for a year. So I move\nmy desk around to wherever the most important place is for the company. And then I'll sort of maintain a\ndesk there over time to sort of come and check in on things.

But I don't know,\nmaybe this is a question for Jason. I mean, have you guys -- can you share with us maybe what a total\ncapital cost estimate might look like for the Model 3 program now that you've got a handle on what your\nvolume's going to be, or what you want to produce to?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ1 2016 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 04, 2016\nYes, a couple of things there. So one, we've provided some breadcrumbs, like we updated our CapEx\nguidance to -- we had guided at $1.5 billion last quarter. And we think it'll probably be 50% higher than\nthat for 2016 -- into 2017.\nUnknown Executive\n$1.5 billion.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nWhat?\nUnknown Executive\n$1.5 billion.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\n$1.5 billion. And into 2017. We're not going to talk about that right now. But the other thing to pay\nattention to is our CapEx for this quarter was $216 million, which was a 47% decrease over Q4. A little bit\nof that is what we talked about last quarter, where a lot of the big investments from Model X had already\nbeen made. But also, we're just really focusing, as Elon has said, on capital efficiency and making sure\nthat we are investing in the highest and best uses of cash. And I think those principles are what's going to\nguide the Model 3 program.\nPatrick Kenehan Archambault\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nYes, I mean, look, that's a good starting point to work with for us. I mean, we appreciate the update for\nthis year. Maybe the way to take the question is just kind of understand when the peak spending periods\nare going to be. And if you're launching through middle of next year, is it kind of a good idea to maybe\nextend the amount of capital you see spending kind of in the balance of the 3 [ph] quarters through the\nsecond half of next year? And then clearly, with the launch, that tapers off. Is that a right way to think\nabout it? And then second to that, I would probably ask the same question just on the R&D front. When do\nthose costs spike in the timeframe of that program?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSure, I think you're thinking about it the right way, the way you've laid it out. And you can kind of use\nModel X and Model S and the ramp of capital for those programs as a way to think about Model 3. On the\nR&D piece of it, that is a big driver behind our updating of our range to 20% to 25% OpEx in 2016. So\nwe'll start to see a little bit of that in the second half of this year. And then certainly, some more into the\nfirst half of 2017.\nPatrick Kenehan Archambault\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nGot it. If I can squeeze in one last one, just on the sourcing. Is this changing your strategy of working\nwith suppliers? I mean, you've done a lot in-house for all your products so far, but obviously, this is a\nvery different kind of volume number you're talking about. So are you thinking about changing the level\nof vertical integration? And how does that work into sort of the ongoing capital requirements for this\nprogram?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nNo. I think we're actually going to increase the amount of vertical integration that we have. I think it's\nvery important for us to have the ability to produce almost any part on the car at will, because it alleviatesTESLA, INC. FQ1 2016 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 04, 2016\nrisk with suppliers, where -- going back to like, where if 2% of supply is not ready, we can't make the car.\nHaving the ability internally to adapt and make those -- that 2% of parts internally is a -- really massively\nreduces risks associated with the production ramp. That, I think, is a very important thing. Now once --\nlike, if we get to a steady state and we talk to a supplier and they can do a very efficient job of making\nthat part, we have no problem transitioning it from in-sourced to outsourced. I've always -- not to in-\nsource for the sake of in-sourcing, but rather to in-source if we think that it has meaningful improvement\non schedule or cost or quality. And I mean, one of the challenges we face is that for a lot of the supply\nchain, they are impedance matched to the timeframe for the big OEMs. And Tesla just moves a lot faster\nthan the big OEMs. And so if they're impedance matched to a typical sort of 10 -- sorry, sort of -- call it\nlike a 6-year development cycle and we're on a 2- or 3-year development cycle, it just doesn't -- couldn't\nconnect properly.

First, it looked like in the proxy that the\nAlpha prototype was completed as of -- when it was filed a few weeks ago. So a few questions. One,\nwhen do you kind of expect the Beta prototype to be achieved? When do you think you'll have firm specs\nfor both your internal parts operations and for your external suppliers? And then in terms of the capital,\ndo you see -- 2 other questions. Kind of when would you see raising capital, if at all, to meet this? And\nthen finally, given the volume of trade-off decisions you're talking about making between manufacturing,\ndesign, engineering, do you see any role for a COO-type similar to what you have at SpaceX to accomplish\nthis timeline?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nOkay, that's like 17 questions in one.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nYou could send us the project plan.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, from an engineering standpoint, we're already almost complete with the design of Model 3. And\nin fact, the prototype that was driving at the Model 3 event the end of March was actually using the\nproduction drivetrain. So I think we feel pretty good about engineering completion of the last items\nprobably within 6 to 8 weeks, thereabouts. The -- so the -- and -- so with -- sort of completing the final\nrelease for tooling no later than the end of June. That sort of leaves roughly 9 months for the tools to\nbe manufactured, which, I think, is an achievable timeframe. It's gets [ph] some suppliers, but it's an\nachievable timeframe. I mean, you can have a -- you can create a human baby in 9 months. I think you\ncan pretty much make a tool in 9 months. So that's our expectations. So then, we want to have parts off\nproduction tooling starting in April next year. So we've got 3 months of validation for a normal start of\nvolume production in July. Again, it's a nominal start, and it's a date that we internally take seriously, and\nthat suppliers need to take seriously. But it is one where inevitably, there will be some small number of\nitems that cause slippage that -- such that the actual date of reaching volume production is some number\nof months after that. This is simply in the nature of things. It's unavoidable. And so that's -- and if you tell\nme what those parts would be, we'd be able to take action now. It's easier to see what these things are\nin hindsight, but not in advance. And sometimes, they're the things you don't expect to be a problem. So\nthere's -- Tesla is a large, complex business.

Again, I sort of want to emphasize some comments that I made earlier in the earnings call, which is,\nTesla is really hell-bent on being the world's best at manufacturing. Like, this is a big deal. And I think it's\nthe right thing to do because what we're trying to do is get as many electric cars on the road as possible.\nAnd what's the limiting factor? Well, it's production, like how can we scale and scale efficiently? And so we\nneed to go -- we need to figure out how to be the world's best in manufacturing. That's what we're going\nto be hell-bent on doing.",

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nElon, so on our math, your combined fleet of Model S and X are driving more than 3 million miles a day.\nSo in just one day, your cars do about 2x the distance that Google's done in the entire history of their\nself-driving car project. Now while your cars aren't exactly sensor-encrusted Christmas trees with tens\nof thousands of dollars of equipment, like a retrofitted Google car, it's still a lot of miles. And I was just\nwondering if you could explain to the investment community what kind of advantage this gives Tesla in the\nrace for sustainable transport and accident-free driving in some commercial, financial terms, if you could,\nor even engineering terms.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, I mean, I think you've pretty much asked the question and then answered it. The -- I mean, data\nis everything, really, when you're trying to solve the autonomous transport problem and having millions\nof miles per day of data accumulating. And then as the fleet grows, that grows proportionate to the fleet,\nit's incredibly helpful. I mean, I think, really -- and particularly, as you go to, say, kind of -- in the long-\nterm, kind of fully autonomous driving which, I think, is going to -- that's going to require quite a lot of\nregulatory oversight. And I think in order for regulators to be comfortable approving that, they're going to\nwant to see a very large amount of data, like, maybe billions of miles showing that the car is unequivocally\nsafer in autonomous mode compared to manual mode in a wide range of circumstances, in countries all\naround the world with different rules of the road and ways of behavior. And yes, so you can -- it'll have to\nbe something statistically significant like billions of miles.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionTESLA, INC. FQ1 2016 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 04, 2016\nOkay, well, that actually Elon, leads to my follow-up, which is once high volumes of statistical data for your\nautonomous miles are collected and analyzed, I can't help but get it out of my mind, I have this image\nof you and some CEOs of other auto companies and CEOs of other software and tech hardware firms\ntestifying in Congress about the urgent need to replace these dangerous, purely human-driven cars on the\nroad with available, affordable and proven, even L2, L3 technology or semiautonomous that's ready for\nintroduction to dramatically improve the epidemic of traffic fatalities. And it's like a national public health\nand safety priority. Am I crazy, Elon, about kind of -- that type of -- that role for people in your position to\nplay, armed with the data empirically? And if I'm not crazy, then how soon do you think it would take for\ntech firms like you to have a sufficient quantity and quality of data to be able to make such a scientifically\nproven case?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, I really don't feel like -- I mean, Tesla will argue for autonomous driving, but we're not going to\nargue against manual driving. People should have the freedom to choose to do what they want to do. And\nyes, sometimes those things are dangerous, but freedom is important. And if people want to drive even\nif it's dangerous, they should be allowed to drive, in my view. But then the autonomous safety systems\nshould be in there, so that even if you're in manual mode, the car will still aid you in avoiding an accident.",

Does it accelerate the need for a second Gigafactory? Or maybe\nperhaps you found a way to squeeze more out of the existing one?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nWell, I think the simplest answer is that we have a lot more capacity at that site than the initial 35 to --\nand 15 gigawatt hours that we discussed. That's part of why we've so aggressively made sure that we\nhave extra land and extra space around the site, so that we can continue to expand.

So I think about a month ago, when you started\ntweeting those preorders, right, the investor and parts supplier confidence in your ability to ramp to 0.5\nmillion units rightfully skyrocketed. With that said, from a supply perspective, you have sometimes had\ndifficulty in achieving delivery targets because of the issues in smoothly increasing capacity in assembly,\nand you've shown a strong preference for emphasizing quality over quantity. So is there anything that's\nchanged on the supply side of the equation that should also be confidence instilling maybe, I don't know,\nlessons learned from the launch of X or some other factor that should give confidence in your ability to be\nat a 200,000 to 400,000 unit annual run rate of Model 3 production approximately 14 months from now?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. Again, I want to emphasize that the July 1 date is not a date that will actually be met. It is an\nimpossible date. However, it is a date we need to hold ourselves to internally and we need to hold\nsuppliers to. But it is an impossible date because there's 6,000, 7,000 unique components in the Model 3,\nand it -- and that would assume that all of them arrive on time. Just like if you have a college term paper,\nthere are always late term papers. But you still have to have a deadline and it needs to be real and one\nwith consequences if a deadline is not met. But it absolutely will not -- the probability of it occurring is\nincredibly low of actually achieving it on July 1. But nonetheless, it is a date we have to take seriously.\nI explained that with some risk of this being misinterpreted, but hopefully, people will appreciate that\nI'm trying to explain how it needs to work and it kind of has to work that way. There's no other way to\ndo it. And the things that help us get there are designing Model 3 for manufacturing with engineering,\nmanufacturing engineering and production and supply chain, all in a very close loop, and making sure that\nwe design the car to be easy to make, that we iterate with suppliers, and ask them how -- if we're giving\nthem a design that's easy to make or when it's hard to make, or how do we make it -- how do we reduce\nrisk and make improvements and make it easier to build, this is really fundamentally different from S and\nX. The S was the first car we really designed ourselves, and it was all about just trying to make the car\nwork in the first place. X was basically built off of the S platform, but then even more complicated. So\nunfortunately, even harder to make. The Model 3 will -- is the first car Tesla's creating that is designed\nto be easy to make, but this is really a fundamental difference.

Our deliveries were a little bit\nback-end loaded. And as those cars were delivered in early April, we were able to pay a significant portion\nof that back.\nElon R.

It's important to say like why is that\ndifferent from like general debt? The -- unlike other automotive companies, Tesla doesn't ship to dealers.\nWe ship to customers. So we build the cars to order. The car is complete, and it's going to a known\ncustomer. So really, the only risk associated with that is if like the ship sinks or something, or the truck\nthat's carrying the cars crashes. But the ABL is -- the asset-backed line is basically finished goods in\ntransit to known customers. It's not like general corporate debt.

And then if I can just ask one follow-up from another question is, I mean, as you look\nat ramp with suppliers, is there any recourse to suppliers that don't meet sort of that start of production\nnext year or any point of the production schedule? Or is there -- is it really just you cancel the business\nand move on to another supplier?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes.

And what's happening is that dealers are using\nkind of vestigial legislation that was originally put in for a just purpose, which is to protect them from\npredatory practices from the franchisor, and then using it for an unjust purpose, which is to prevent direct\ndistribution. We believe that in the long term, justice will prevail.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nOkay.

So it is a super, super majority of a new client base or a customer base for Tesla,\nand it's exciting. It was exciting when we walked the lines.

And so they're\nexpressing interest in both. In terms of their S and X as a bridge to Model 3, we are talking through and\nthinking through that, because as Elon mentioned earlier, the quickest path to receiving a Model 3 is being\na Tesla owner. We've agreed that Tesla owners are receiving priority in terms of production, and so you\ncan run the math I just mentioned. If 93% are new to Tesla, 7% of the reservation holders are Tesla\nowners.

But how do I think\nabout that ramp-up from 0 to 500,000 over -- let's push it, from 2018 on? Does it go from 0 to 500,000\nover 2 years or 1 year? Or how do we think about that?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, I mean, obviously, if we're saying that Tesla will have total vehicle production of on the order of\n500,000 cars in 2018, it can't be more than sort of 2 years to get there. So now, the -- just sort of\nanother -- maybe better efficient [ph] about -- education about production ramps is, production ramps\nlook like an S curve. It's extremely difficult to predict with precision the early part of the S curve. So --\nbecause in the early part of the S curve, you have -- it sort of starts off very slow and then it increases\nexponentially, it moves to a linear, and then moves to a logarithmic. So it's really -- it's terribly difficult to\npredict exactly what the shape of that S curve is. And that's where things get tricky because you end up\nputting quarterly results, kind of bracketing somewhere on that S curve, and depending from where you\nare on that S curve, it can actually look like a big difference. But actually, it could be a shift of a few weeks\nbecause of the exponential nature of the beginning of the S curve.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2016 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 04, 2016\nBenjamin Joseph Kallo\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nAnd my 19th question. Can you make 50% gross margin on it or 20% gross margin? Or how do you think\nabout margins, like because people think you can't make it profitably [indiscernible].\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, we're -- I mean, we're highly confident that can be made profitably. And design for manufacturing\nand economies of scale are the keys to achieving that outcome. Yes, I think -- like, GM is not aiming for\nanything near the volumes that we are, and so that they're -- I mean, despite being a big company, their\neconomies of scale are going to be driven by the -- whatever elements are unique in their EV. And we\nknow for a fact that they will not get the economies of scale that we will be at for Model 3.",
        "summary_text": "Elon Musk: I feel confident that we're going to hit like the 2000-vehicle-a-week target by the end of this quarter. The average battery pack size for the 3 will be less than 75 kilowatt-hours, he said. Musk: There's no question, the X is a very difficult car to manufacture."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Dana Hull of Bloomberg News.\nDana Hull\nWhat is the mix of -- in 2018 of the 500,000 cars? I mean, it's combined S, X and 3. Should we think of it\nas like 300,000, 3? Or -- I mean, what's the kind of mix of those 3 vehicles?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, I mean, I don't think we've got like an amazing crystal ball to figure out exactly what it's going to\nbe. But I mean, I feel confident about the top line number, but the mix internally is -- it's difficult to figure\nthat out. I mean, yes -- but I mean, maybe it's something like 100,000 to 150,000 S and X, and then\n300,000 to 400,000 of 3. But this is -- I don't know, it's really hard to say.\nDana Hull\nHard to say? Okay. And then as you try to attract top manufacturing talent as you begin to ramp, have\nyou given any thought to trying to hire a COO? I mean, I'm just thinking about your personal life between\nTesla and SpaceX and sleeping in the sleeping bag and working 90 hours a week between 2 companies.\nSpaceX has a great COO and has had one since the company -- for years, but Tesla never has.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI mean, it's sort of -- I mean, it's really -- I mean, the sort of scope of Tesla's [indiscernible] activity is\nbroader than SpaceX. And SpaceX is more of a pure technology company and does not have the sort of\nsales, service and kind of fleet management, and customer financing, and all that sort of stuff that Tesla\nhas. Obviously, Jon's -- Jon McNeill's taking that -- has that role at Tesla. And then, my focus is primarily\non technology, design and then manufacturing. So -- but I mean, you certainly can expect that there will\nbe announcements in the fairly near future about some great executives joining the ranks.",

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Phil LeBeau of CNBC.\nPhil Lebeau\nElon, I have a question. It was about 10 minutes ago, you made a reference to 1 million vehicles in 2020.\nIs that a production target, a production goal, or a hypothetical? I'm just looking for some clarification\nthere.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectTESLA, INC. FQ1 2016 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 04, 2016\nI mean, that's my best guess. If we're 0.5 million in 2018, and then sort of roughly 50%-ish growth from\nthere, then, it's probably around 1 million in 2020.\nPhil Lebeau\nAnd do you not have an estimate as to how many production plants you will need in order to make that\nhappen?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, we -- I think it is actually feasible. Maybe not advisable, but feasible to do it with just Fremont and\nthe Gigafactory. We actually believe that Fremont and the Gigafactory could scale to 1 million vehicles.\nWhether that's actually wise is a separate question. And as I said earlier, it's going to make sense to\ndo localized production, at least on a continent basis. Otherwise, your logistics cost end up being quite\nextreme. Or they start -- your logistics cost start becoming a bigger and bigger percentage of the total\nvehicle cost. I mean, that's really why manufacturers build their cars for a local market. They build cars\nfor a market in that market because the logistics cost associated with shipping a 1.5- to 2-ton vehicle are\nmassively greater than, say, shipping a little consumer electronics device.",
