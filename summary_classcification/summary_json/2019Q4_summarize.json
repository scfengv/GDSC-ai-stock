        "paragraph": "Instructions] But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nThanks, Martin. So Q4 was another strong quarter for the company. Deliveries reached over 112,000\nvehicles in a single quarter. It's hard to think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can\ngenerate more than $20 billion in revenue with 0 advertising spend. I think that's -- where we do say\nthat from time to time, I think it's often overlooked, but to have the highest-demand electric vehicle in\nthe world with no advertising spend is, I think, quite remarkable and speaks to the nature of the product\nand the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate that demand without a bunch of\nadvertising.\nAt our Fremont factory, we're producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in its record\nyear of 2006. And obviously, we expect to exceed that significantly this year. This rate of production was\n[ cheap ] before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont. So there's a lot of potential to go\nbeyond that number.\nFor the Shanghai factory, I'd like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launching Model\n3 last quarter and achieving the first deliveries earlier this year. I'm really excited and optimistic about the\npotential for the Shanghai factory. I think it's going to be an incredible asset to the company. And we also\nbroke ground on the Model Y factory in Shanghai. So a lot of good progress there.\nRegarding Model Y, it was only 10 months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype. And now in January\nthis year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already. Now this is thanks to a great effort\nfrom our engineering team. And we managed to achieve, by far, the highest energy efficiency of any\nelectric SUV ever produced at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y all-wheel drive got an\nEPA rating of 315 miles. This improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today. This is above what\nwe've previously stated by a pretty significant margin. And then just with great acceleration, top speed,\nit's really just incredible specs all around.TESLA, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  JAN 29, 2020\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5For the Cybertruck, a few months ago, we revealed the -- obviously, remember, we revealed the\nCybertruck, that was -- that went viral. And we tried to build a product that -- a product that is superior\nin every way without any preconceptions of how such a product should look. So it really just -- from the\nstandpoint of what's the most badass, futuristic, armored personnel carrier that kicks the ass of any other\npickup truck, basically that's the goal. And we wanted it to look like something that just kind of came out\nof a sci-fi movie set from the future. And the demand has been incredible. We've never seen actually such\na level of demand at this -- we've never seen anything like it, basically. I think we will make as -- about\nas many as we can sell for many years. So as many -- we will sell as many as we can make. It's going to\nbe pretty nuts. So -- and I think, actually, the product is better than people realize even. They don't even\nhave enough information to realize just the awesomeness of it. It's just great.\nSo -- and then stepping back in 2018, from a financial standpoint, we were -- free cash flow rate was\nbreakeven. But in 2019, we managed to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow while building\na factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y in production. So I think for us\nto have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacity while developing new\nproducts, while improving the core engineering, is a testament to the, I think, incredible performance of\nthe Tesla team. And I'm just so proud to work with such a great team.\nI'd like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control. That's what has allowed us\nto get to these compelling financial numbers, while at the same time, growing company at an incredible\npace.\nAnd in conclusion, when I think of what we have in front of us in the next couple of years, we've got Model\nY, we've got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck, some very exciting improvements in\nbattery technology, we've got Full Self-Driving, the next-gen Roadster and probably a bunch of other\nproducts we'll come up with, too. It's hard to think of another company that has more exciting product\nand technology road map.\nSo super fired up about where Tesla will be in the next 10 years. If you look back 10 years from today to\n2010, we will produce approximately 1,000x more cars in 2020 than we produced in 2010. One thousand.\nAnd we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit and Powerwall, Powerpack, all those other things, too. So\nwhere will we be in 10 years? Very excited to consider the prospect.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you very much, Elon. And Zach has some opening remarks as well.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. Thanks, Martin. This past year was truly transformational for Tesla, and I want to thank everyone\nwho's been a part of making this happen.\nOn 2019, a few key points I'd like to highlight. On demand, while we've mentioned this a few times, it's\nworth highlighting once again. Over the course of the year, we've transitioned entirely from generating\nModel 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand. We've also seen a\nstabilization of Model 3 ASPs, even increasing slightly in Q4. And we've seen an increase in ASPs of S and\nX after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.\nWith respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch of Model 3 in\nFremont and Reno. As a result, we've been able to bring new production capacity on board faster and with\nless cost. This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in Shanghai as well as Model Y in Fremont, programs\nthat were both launched in under one year.\nFinancially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled through higher\nvolumes, improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management and continued\nimprovement in our product and operational costs. And we are able to achieve positive GAAP net income\nin both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled strong cash generation. We've also madeTESLA, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  JAN 29, 2020\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6progress on recurring software-based revenue with the implementation of premium connectivity and the\nbeginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobile app.\nFinally, on stock-based compensation, it increased sequentially by $82 million, driven almost entirely by an\nexpense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant. This is a result of our improved expected financial\nperformance of the company, which the CEO stock grant is tied to.\nAs we look ahead to 2020, this, again, will be an important year for the company. Our task ahead is to\nexecute on the next phase of growth while managing cash flows to support that growth. On Model Y, we\nexpect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp over subsequent quarters. As\nmentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Y compared to the Model 3.\nThis year, for the Shanghai-built Model 3, we expect to achieve run rate production and delivery rates. In\naddition, we expect to have completed the majority of planned supply chain localization at the factory or\nin the region. This is one of the most important components to achieve lower production costs for the site.\nWe are also seeing strong order rates for the locally built Model 3 and remain focused on continuing the\nproduction ramp and managing costs. We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction of\nShanghai- and Berlin-built Model Y, which will result in continued increases in capital spending.\nOn operating expenses, I expect an increase over the course of the year to support our growing product\npipeline and international footprint. However, OpEx growth should increase at a lower rate than top line\nrevenue.\nOverall, we believe this will set us up for our strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient\nforecasted cash flows to support investments related to our growth and further strengthening of our\nbalance sheet.\nFor Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality. Additionally, we are in\nthe process of ramping 2 major products, Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which I expect will\ntemporarily weigh on our margins. We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent\nwe may be temporarily impacted by the coronavirus. At this point, we're expecting a 1- to 1.5-week delay\nin the ramp of Shanghai-built Model 3 due to a government-required factory shutdown. This may slightly\nimpact profitability for the quarter but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains\nin the early stages.\nWe are also closely monitoring whether there'll be interruptions in the supply chain for cars built in\nFremont. So far, we're not aware of anything material, but it's important to caveat that this is an\nevolving story. However, we have more than sufficient cash to continue our expansion plans while further\nstrengthening the balance sheet.\nThank you, again, for your support, and we will turn to questions.TESLA, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  JAN 29, 2020\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7Question and Answer\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you. We are going to take the first questions from retail investors compiled by Say Technologies.\nSo the first retail investor question is, \"since solar is required for all new home constructions in California,\ndo you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large California homebuilders that\nyou can share? What's the 2020 target for the number of Solarglass Roof installations in California?\"\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWell, I think we do -- we are seeing, mostly from a small base, exponential growth in demand and output\nfor solar -- for the Solarglass Roof. So it's difficult to predict what the demand will be this year, except that\nthe demand is very strong. And we are working also not just through Tesla Solar Roof but also through\nnew homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whether it's in North America, on the\norder of 4 million new roofs per year. So we see a lot of interest.\nAnd so it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do the\ninstallation. But over time, I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something to use\nSolarglass in one form or another. It's really going to be a choice of do you want a roof that is alive with\npower or dead without. And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and looks good and\nlasts a long time, and it's the future we want.\nSo it will be a significant product, but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product and there's a lot\nof challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome, and this will be a major product line of Tesla. And\nthe Buffalo factory is doing great. So, yes.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you. And the second question from retail shareholders is, \"will you release the Tesla ride-hailing\nnetwork app before full autonomy and change the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow owners to be drivers\non the network? If so, when will this happen? Might want to target California airports first. Also a good\nplace to add Superchargers.\"\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nSorry, it sounds like more question than one.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nYes, it's a bit of a bundle. Yes.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWell, I think it's -- it probably will make sense to have the -- to enable car sharing in advance of the kind\nof sort of driving robotaxi fleet because the car sharing can be done before Full Self-Driving is approved\nby regulators. So it's probably something that we would enable before the full sort of robotaxi fleet is\nenabled. And it sounds like there were some other questions bundled in there.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nSuperchargers at airports.TESLA, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  JAN 29, 2020\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8Elon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nSure. Yes. Yes, probably, we'll have Superchargers in airports. We'll have Superchargers wherever we see\nthat there is a need for Superchargers.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd then on the insurance part of the question, it is our intent to allow people to put their cars into ride-\nsharing or the FSD network using Tesla Insurance. That's not currently the case, but by the time that this\nis available, it's our intent to get that ready.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nYes, thank you. Next question from retail investors is, \"how many California owners are currently insured\nwith Tesla Insurance? What's the target for Tesla Insurance in 2020? When will you start to significantly\nleverage the data you have from the fleet to lower the cost of your coverage? Will we get premium\ndiscount of certain percent?\"\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. I mean, go ahead, Zach.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. So Tesla Insurance is currently available in California. A couple of things that we're working on, on\nthis front. The first is to expand it to other locations. And we're preparing the regulatory processes --\npreparing our processes to go through the regulatory processes in those locations. We're also working\non the processes to continue to adjust our rates in California, which also have to go through regulatory\nprocesses as insurance is quite heavily regulated. And that's where we're spending our time focusing on\nTesla Insurance right now. There's a significant amount of innovation, as we've discussed before in this\nspace, exactly getting to the intent of what the question here is, using our technology to reduce rates. And\nthis will be rolled in over time.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThe last part of the question was, will there be a discount for using Autopilot with our cars?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nOh, yes. Yes. Yes, there will be.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nThe rate card for California, Tesla Insurance already considers the safety features associated with\nAutopilot.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nRight. But I think it would make sense for us to close loop on higher use of Autopilot for it reduces the\ninsurance cost as well as the probability of injury. So I think insurance is going to be, I think, quite a\nmajor product of Tesla over time. The amount of money that people spend on car insurance is like a\nremarkably big percentage of the cost of a car. You can lease a Model 3 right now for $400 a month, but a\ntypical owner in California will be paying sort of between $100 and $200 a month in insurance.TESLA, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  JAN 29, 2020\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9So we're talking about something which is maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of the cost of the lease of the car is\ninsurance. And a lot of that insurance cost is just because the insurance companies don't have good\ninformation about the drivers. And there's no good way to provide feedback, where it's a very poor\nfeedback mechanism in terms of the insurance rates versus the actual way that the car is being driven,\nwhereas we can do that in real time. It's a fundamental information advantage that insurance companies\ndon't have.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you. The next question is, \"you set expectations that you would be feature-complete on FSD by the\nend of 2019. Can you please provide an update on when will we see this with end users? Where are you in\nretrofitting the FSD computer to older models?\"\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWell, I mean to be precise, I said I was hoping it would be feature-complete with most FSD by the\nend of last year. We got pretty close. It's looking like we might be feature-complete in a few months.\nFeature-complete means just like it has some chance of going from your home to work, let's say, with\nno interventions. So that's -- it doesn't mean the features are working well, but it means it has above 0\nchance. So I think that's looking like maybe it's going to be a couple of months from now.\nAnd -- but what isn't obvious regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving is just how much work has been\ngoing into improving the foundational elements of autonomy. The core Autopilot software and AI team\nis just, I think, very, very strong and making great progress. And we're really only beginning to take full\nadvantage of the Autopilot hardware, the FSD hardware. So I think it's -- the apparent progress, as seen\nby consumers, will seem to be extremely rapid. But actually, what's really going on, it seems like that is\njust having the foundational software be very strong, have really strong foundation.\nAnd then a really fundamental thing is moving to video training. So in terms of labeling, labeling with\nvideo and all 8 cameras simultaneously. This is a really -- I mean, in terms of labeling efficiency, arguably\nlike a 3 order of magnitude improvement in labeling efficiency. For those who know about this, it's\nextremely fundamental. So that's really great progress on that.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you. And the last retail investor question comes from Kendall. \"Since most retail investors seem to\nunderstand Tesla better than analysts and are risking a larger part of their own personal wealth on Tesla,\ndoesn't it make sense to take mostly questions on these earnings calls from us, via Say? Do you even\nhave to take questions -- answer questions from analysts?\"\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWell, I guess we don't have to. I do think that a lot of retail investors actually have a deeper and more\naccurate insights than many of the big institutional investors and certainly a better insight than many of\nthe analysts. It seems like if people really looked at some of the smart retail investors, analysts and --\nwhat some of the smart -- smaller retail investors predicted about the future of Tesla, that would -- you'd\nprobably get the highest accuracy and remarkable insight from some of those predictions.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. So now let's switch to institutional shareholder questions. The #1 question is, you have spoken\npreviously about Shanghai Giga being 65% lower CapEx per unit of capacity. Have you learned to do\nanything better or different from an OpEx perspective? And if yes, what kind of impact might we expect on\nthe long-term gross margin?TESLA, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  JAN 29, 2020\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Elon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nSure. Go ahead, Zach.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items of COGS for\nthe Model 3 there. We have talked a lot about the CapEx per unit of capacity being lower. But -- and you\ncan basically run down an entire list of COGS between labor cost, material cost due to localization. So it's\nopening up suppliers that would not have made economic sense from the States. Localizing the supply\nchain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well. So we're not shipping cars from\nCalifornia over to China. And then that has a corresponding savings on our lower import-related costs.\nAnd there's a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility\nhere in California and also the Model 3 factory in China. And the simplification in terms of the flow is pretty\nevident from that layout, and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for the operations of the facility.\nAnd so if you add all of this up, our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of\nModel 3 in China relative to Fremont. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that the cost of the\nStandard Plus that we're selling out of Shanghai is also lower than that of the similar car coming out of\nFremont, from price perspective. And so -- and I've said this on previous earnings calls, I think it's fair\nto expect the margin coming out of the Shanghai facility to match the same margin for the vehicle in\nFremont.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. I think there's a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars, especially\naffordable cars than 3 and Y, at least on the continent where the customers are. It kind of makes sense.\nBut what we're doing -- or have been doing in the past was really pretty silly, making cars in California\nand then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe. And this created a lot of cost\nbecause you've got to ship those cars. So you've got a lot of finished goods sitting on order or waiting at\nthe port or going through customs. You got tariffs, transport.\nAnd then the factory complexity in California is very high because you've got different regulatory\nrequirements in China, North America and Europe. So there are 3 different types of cars that are being\nbuilt. It's very complex. And just having a factory in China or a factory in California or a factory in North\nAmerica and a factory in Europe, just that alone, is a massive improvement in our fundamental operating\nefficiency. That, I think, is -- may not be fully appreciated.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd also on working capital.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes, absolutely.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nOr reducing OpEx here, too, [ to ultimately change ].\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor RelationsTESLA, INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  JAN 29, 2020\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11Okay. The next question from institutional investors is, \"given the recent run in the share price, why\nnot raise capital now and substantially accelerate the growth in production, i.e., build the Gigafactories,\ninvestment in Supercharger and customer service?\"\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWell, we're actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly. So if there's any sensible\nway to spend money, we are spending it. There is no artificial holdback on expenditures. Anything that I\nsee that is -- looks like it's got good value for money, the answer is yes, immediately. So we're spending\nmoney, I think, efficiently and we're not artificially limiting our progress. And then despite all that, we are\nstill generating positive cash. So in light of that, it doesn't make sense to raise money because we expect\nto generate cash despite this growth level.\nZach, I don't know if you want to...\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nNo. I completely agree with that. I think some of our learnings during the Model 3 launch period were we\ngrew too quickly and with too much complexity, and it held back our ability to continue to scale. And part\nof the journey that we've been on in 2019 is to unwind a series of unintentional bad processes that kind\nof accumulated in the company over time. And so that's kind of what contributes to the reduction in OpEx\nover the year as we get smarter about that.\nAnd now we've laid a good foundation, I think. And I agree with you on that, we're not holding back on\nthe growth. I mean we have 2 products -- 2 vehicle products launching right now. And that will consume\nmuch of the bandwidth of the company to stabilize those over the course of the year. And then looking into\nnext year, we have even more products launching, more factories. And so we want to be smart about how\nwe spend money and grow in a way that's sustainable, so we don't fall victim to the mistakes, I think, we\nmade 1.5 years or so ago.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes, absolutely.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. The next question we've already answered regarding Autopilot time lines. So the following question\nwould be, \"can we please talk about cost control and OpEx sustainability in terms of growth versus gross\nprofit growth? How did we achieve the recent OpEx trends? And how should we think about OpEx needs as\nwe grow both vehicles and geographic workloads?\"\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. I commented briefly on this in my opening remarks. We did see an increase in operating expenses\nfrom Q3 to Q4, even excluding the portion of that attributed to stock-based compensation. And when you\ndouble click into that growth, it's supporting the Model Y program and also Shanghai program as well.\nAnd so I think we, as a company, are now at the point where we've learned a lot on cost efficiency, as I've\njust mentioned. And we've unwound a number of the processes that were not in the right place, including\nautomating with things that need to be automated. And we'll continue on that journey. But I think we're\nat a point now where OpEx will start to tick up, at least if you look annually from 2019 to 2020, to support\nour international footprint and then the growth of the company. Our job is to grow that significantly slower\nthan the pace of growth of revenue to improve the operating leverage, which we're very, very focused on.\nMartin ViechaTESLA, INC.

And the last question from investors is, \"the sales of model S and X have stayed flat for several\nquarters. The main reason is that they still use 18650 batteries. When will S and X use 2170 batteries?\nManufacturing capacity of 18650 may be used for battery storage systems instead.\"\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nSure. Well, actually, the core chemistry inside the 18650 cell has improved many times over the years.\nSo it's really just a form factor as opposed to a core technology. So it's -- I think we're pretty happy with\nwhere the -- with the energy content of the cell and the improvements in efficiency of the vehicle. We're\nrapidly approaching a 400-mile range for Model S, for example. So this is -- it won't be long before Model\nS is 400 -- has 400-mile range.\nDrew, is there anything you want to add to that?\nAndrew D. Baglino\nChief Technology Officer\nNo. Other than to say that the 18650 lines have been running smoothly for a really long time in a world\nwhere cell supply is fueling growth like we're part of the fuel of growth. I don't see a reason to turn that\ncell supply off.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. And actually, the Model S and X actually have more range than we are just currently stating on the\nwebsite. We just haven't gotten around to updating, the, I guess, the EPA certified number. But the actual\nrange of the Model S and X are above what the website says there are.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nThe existing cars.\nElon R.

So Elon, do you see potential for Tesla\nvehicles to be fitted with user terminals that are compatible with the Starlink constellation in the near- or\nmedium-term future?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWell, it's certainly something that could be happening in the coming years. There's no plans for it this\nyear. The focus of Starlink is really for high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity for homes and businesses,\nand I guess, aircraft and boats and that kind of thing. But the antenna for that high-bandwidth, low-\nlatency thing is sort of about the size of medium pizza, which you could put on a car, but I think it's more\nbandwidth than you would really need. Technically, you could buy one and just stick it on the car. Yes, it\nwill work. Space range.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nAnd maybe just as a follow-up for my follow-up. How would -- assuming that we get the antenna\nform factor and cost down to a point where that could be integrated to the roof of a car, for example,\ncost effectively and aerodynamically, et cetera, how would compatibility with the Starlink architecture\ntheoretically improve the Tesla customer experience or the capability of the network?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWell, I think it actually most possible that we'll just use the cellular connectivity, just use 5G. It would be\nthe recommendation, certainly, in like any cities or something like that. But if you're out in the countryside\nand there's not good cell connectivity, then maybe you could connect with a Starlink antenna. And you\ndon't need to like have like gigabit level or level of connectivity. You can -- probably like 20, 30 megabits\nis probably fine. And you can have much lower antenna.\nSo yes, I guess it could be good for making sure there's connectivity and -- outside of major cities and\nthat kind of thing. But I mean that's -- yes, I'm sort of, I'd say, relatively obtuse. It's not -- we're not\nthinking about it very much, to be honest.",

Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nAbsolutely.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\n[ Just on the right ] metric.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes, it's a good -- yes. I think there's so much at Tesla where the core technology is improving radically\nthat maybe you wouldn't necessarily notice as an end customer. Or some of them, you'd notice; some of\nthem, you wouldn't. But it's just -- there are these things that have a big effect on the efficiency of the\ncompany, like our internal applications team that kind of builds the Tesla internal operating system and\nimproves the sort of core automation of the company. That makes a big difference to our productivity. But\nyou wouldn't necessarily -- you would see it effectively in healthier financials, but you wouldn't necessarily\nnotice it as an end customer.\nDaniel V. Galves\nWolfe Research, LLC\nOkay. Got it. Maybe I could follow up. I mean your kind of operating cash flow, EBITDA is annualizing at\n$4.5 billion right now. As I look out to the future, I'm kind of guessing that, that could fund somewhere\naround 200,000 to 250,000 units of capacity a year, which would be maybe a 30% CAGR over 5 years.\nI mean is that something that's feasible for you guys to execute on, on a consistent basis, a level of\ncapacity building that large?\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nI mean, I think...\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWe're heading for more than 30%, yes.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, I think the math -- I'm not sure of the math that you've done, but I think our internal plans are\nfaster. And just back on your first question, we will have additional detail on CapEx in the 10-K. But back\nto the growth rate, I mean, one thing to keep in mind is that the Shanghai facility, we do have a loan\nfacility in place to support that growth. So that helps. And then as our production volumes increase, that\ngenerates more cash flow in the business as well that allows us to continue to fund additional factory.

        "paragraph": "Our next question from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures.\nCharles Eugene Munster\nLoup Ventures, LLC\nCongratulations on the progress. First question related to Cybertruck. You mentioned you'll sell as many as\nyou can make. Can you remind me how many you think you can make? And any thoughts on the cost of\nproduction for making those Cybertrucks?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nI think we don't comment on those detailed numbers, except the demand is just far more than we could\nreasonably make in the space of, I don't know, 3 or 4 years or something like that. So the thing we're\ngoing to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that's very fundamental\nbecause if you don't improve battery production capacity, then you end up just shifting unit volume from\none product to another, and you haven't actually produced more electric vehicles.\nSo that's part of the reason why we have not, for example, really accelerated production of the Tesla\nSemi because it does use a lot of cells. And unless we've got a lot of battery cells available, then say like\naccelerated production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making fewer Model 3 or Model Y\ncars. So we've got to really make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery production and continue to\nimprove the cost per kilowatt hour of the batteries. This is very fundamental and extremely difficult.\nSo I said we're going to do like kind of Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this and what our\nplans are. I think probably it's going to make sense to do that after the end of this quarter because I think\nit's going to be kind of an intense end of quarter as it was last quarter. So tentatively, sort of in the April\ntime frame, we'll do a Battery Day and kind of go through what the challenges are, how do you get from\nhere to, I don't know, a couple of thousand gigawatt hours a year or something.\nCharles Eugene Munster\nLoup Ventures, LLC\nGreat. I look forward to that Battery Day. You also mentioned in your prepared comments about other\nproducts that may come up, and the only vehicle not announced for master plan part 2 is a high\npassenger density vehicle. Any light that you can give us regarding that project?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. Going back to what I just said, the -- we've got to improve the total battery capacity. Otherwise, we\nadd complexity, but we do not improve the number of vehicles on the road. So while we do some sort of\nhigh-capacity vehicle at some point probably, but we need to make sure we got the batteries to make cars\nthat we've already got already on our plate. And it's just generally true.\nAnd I've seen some, I think, sort of sensible comments by ARK Invest where they're pointing out that\nreally people do prefer to drive in their cars mostly by themselves. And like the average -- I mean the\naverage number of occupants in a car, I think, is like 1.2. And maybe with autonomy, maybe they'll go to\n1.4, maybe. But I'm not sure if it even goes there.\nSo yes, will it make sense for us to do sort of a minivan or sort of Sprinter-like van at some point?\nProbably. But like I said, we've got to solve this battery -- we've got to scale battery production to crazy\nlevels that people cannot even fathom today. That's the real problem.",

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 16Our next question comes from [ John Sager ] with Evercore ISI.\nUnknown Analyst\nI want to talk about the differences between the Model 3 and the Model Y beyond the sort of 10% rule\nof thumb just around cargo and size. Are there other features that are going to differentiate the 2\nmodels? And then as a follow-on to that, you've talked in the past about how Model S sales grew with\nthe introduction of Model X. So are you planning on setting up your production facilities to align with that\nthesis that essentially Model 3 sales will expand alongside the introduction of Model Y?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWe're not quite sure what's going to happen, but it is true that Model X -- the introduction of Model X\nactually increased Model S sales because people would come in and look at the Model X and they like\nsaid, \"okay, I prefer the sedan.\" And we're worried that X sales would cause S sales to drop but it actually\ncaused it to increase. So from -- like I said, we're not too worried about demand. We're worried about\nproduction, make sure we get that production ramp going and reach volume production as soon as\npossible with Model Y.\nAnd it's hard to -- it's always hard to predict what that S -- the exponential part of the S-curve of\nproduction. Our production pretty much always follows this S-curve, or it's kind of like a herky jerky S-\ncurve. And you can -- it's easy to predict what it's going to be like in beginning because it's low, and it's\neasy to predict what it's going to be like at the end, but that intermediate portion of the S-curve is very\ndifficult to predict. So that's -- and it involves a massive amount of hard work and just reacting fast to\nissues that arise.\nSo yes, I think we'll just go as fast as we can with Model Y and make sure it's a great product. I think\nthere are some things that will differentiate it but not -- it's not something we want to talk about on this\ncall. And I think when they do -- when people do a teardown of the Model Y, I think they'll be impressed\nabout some of the things they see.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd just to add to that, I think it's important to keep the Model Y launch in context of the next 18 to 24\nmonths. What we're working on here between Berlin and Shanghai and Fremont is to have 3 and Y locally\nproduced in all locations. And so Model 3 is expanding as Model Y is expanding. There may be ups and\ndowns in various factories as we get to the journey of having these products on the major continents.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nAlso, the rule of thumb of 10%, I think you need to see it. When you see the car, you'll realize that it's not\njust a 10% different car. It's not just -- there's more change happening, like to the customer's perspective\nas well.",

Our order rate supports the pricing that we have right now. We're working very\nhard to reduce costs and expand production because, I mean, we feel from the data, it's pretty clear that\nthere's a lot of interest in our products. And so what we're working on is to increase production, increase\navailability of the products with time. And the price reduction in China, kind of the first step towards this\nglobal localization, more accessible price. And we'll continue to work on cost reductions in China as we do\nin Fremont and grow production.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. I mean the thing that's really going to, I think, probably just have a profound effect on our financials\nis like -- is high volume and high margin, obviously. And that high margin part comes from autonomy. So\ndo people buy the Full Self-Driving package or not and do they buy it worldwide or only in certain places?\nFor example, our autonomy is not as good in China as it is in the U.S. So fewer people -- a very small\npercentage of people buy the FSD package in China.\nBut as we fix that, then we will see a much higher people -- percentage of people buying. And as we\nare close to Full Self-Driving, that's just going to become more and more compelling. So that's -- from\na financial standpoint, that's the real mind-blowing situation, is high volume, high margin because of\nautonomy.\nColin William Rusch\nOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\nOkay. And then just shorter term, there's significant discussion in the industry around moving to higher\nvoltage on the powertrain and then some challenges around the supply chain's preparedness to support\nthat. Separate from the battery pack, since we'll talk about that in a couple of months, can you speak to\nthe areas of focus on powertrain technology-driven cost reduction over the next 12 to 24 months that we\nshould be thinking about?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWell, our powertrain is pretty damn good. I mean it's way better than anything else out there by a country\nmile. It's worth noting, for example, that the Model S has like a 100 kilowatt hour pack, but Taycan has\n100 -- like 95 kilowatt hour pack. The Model S is steadily approaching 400 miles range, but Taycan has\n200 miles range. So we must be using that energy pretty efficiently and the powertrain is a big part of\nthat.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nI would just say the focus is on cost on the powertrain. When we're thinking about technology innovations,\nit's how do we how do we continue to drive the cost down. And that's through -- voltage is maybe one\nangle, but there are certainly others that just enable more power density and lower cost.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & DirectorTESLA, INC.
