        "paragraph": "Instructions]\nSo Jason, over to you.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSure. Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everybody for joining. I just want to make a few brief comments to add a\nlittle bit more color to the shareholder later.\nWe're clearly disappointed with our delivery numbers but there's some underlying stories that we feel\nreally good about, and I want to walk you through those. Automotive gross margin expanded this quarter.\nAutomotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits grew from 20.1% in Q1 to 21.2% in Q2. A couple of\ndifferent factors here. One was the Model S refresh. There was a modest price increase on the refresh but\nmore importantly, we had baked the number of cost-downs into that vehicle before the launch. And then\nthe second big factor is obviously X production. We've talked a lot about how we have come through the\nstruggles on that and how we've managed to climb that production ramp, so that's looking great.\nOn a go-forward basis, the way we're thinking about margins is we certainly see opportunities for\ncontinued cost-downs, both on the engineering front, also on the commercial front as well. We've got\na supplier base that is very excited about the Model 3, and it's giving us the ability to leverage that,\nincluded for cost-downs and also continue manufacturing efficiencies. As we mentioned in the shareholder\nletter, labor hours per car is trending quite positively right now and we're laser focused on continued\nimprovement in that key metric.\nNext, talk about the cash position for a second. Here's one way to think about it. We ended up with $3.25\nbillion on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. We started off the year, in December 31, 2015,\nwe had $1.2 billion. We raised $1.7 billion in our secondary offering and we collected on our Model 3\nreservations. Therefore, we are in a very healthy position from a cash perspective.\nA couple of different factors here to talk about. One, we've got $678 million drawn on our asset-backed\nline. This is something that we've talked about in the past. That is definitely backed up by our operations.\nTwo things there. One, approximately 5,000 cars in transit to customers at quarter end. We're financing\nour FGI. And we're monetizing our direct lease portfolio.\nSecond factor on the cash position that we'd like to highlight is our continued CapEx discipline. As we\ntalked about in Q1, we had $217 million of CapEx in that quarter. In this quarter, $295 million of CapEx.TESLA, INC. FQ2 2016 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 03, 2016\nWe compare that to averaging nearly $400 million a quarter throughout 2015. We're actually very pleased\nwith these results and we're comfortable that we aren't doing anything to adversely impact our future. On\na go-forward basis, thinking about CapEx efficiency, you've heard Elon talk a lot about that machine that\nmakes the machine. A big part of that is focusing on volumetric efficiency. In our call on Monday, I talked\nabout how when we started to review a lot of the Model 3 CapEx plans across the company, there were a\nbunch of new buildings everywhere. And the reaction to that was: wait a second, we've actually got a nice\nfacilities footprint already, and how can we just amplify those facilities and not have to invest further in\nthis area? And we're starting to see a lot of that take hold now.\nSecond, I think we're making an attempt to crush the conventional wisdom that capacity increases only\nhappen in step-change increments and the capital that follows that in step-change increments as well. And\nto put a little bit more color on that, there are many ways to optimize our current operations. The way to\nthink about this is we can just drive greater throughput through the same investments. So that's our cash\nposition.\nFinally, I'd just like to talk for a minute about expense management. In addition to our efforts on CapEx\nefficiency, we're also very focused on OpEx discipline. This quarter, SG&A would have been flat quarter-\nover-quarter in spite of our continued expansion in service and sales, were it not for the payroll taxes we\npaid on our CEO's options exercises. SG&A was up $19 million quarter-over-quarter on a non-GAAP basis.\n$17 million of that was the payroll expense associated with those option exercises.\nR&D now does continue to increase as we continue to march towards the Model 3 launch and continue to\ninvest in our future. This is as predicted and as we've signaled in the past.\nSo to wrap it all up, we're very happy with the gross margin expansion in the quarter and we have\nincreased our emphasis on OpEx discipline and CapEx efficiency. We believe our Q2 results reflect that and\nwe're not backing down as we move forward.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nGreat. Thank you, Jason. All right, Latif, let's go to the first question, please.TESLA, INC.

He had to drop off the call. This is Neel Mehta.\nThis is coming directly from him. You have explained -- Elon, you've explained the strategic rationale for\nhaving SolarCity and Tesla Motors join in a combined company. When we think of SpaceX, is there any\nconceivable strategic rationale for Tesla Motors and Tesla Energy or Tesla Solar to work closely with the\nefforts of space exploration? And when we're thinking about this, we're thinking proprietary lower at the\norbit satellite network to enhance the connected autonomous car ecosystem. And so yes, I just want to\nget your thoughts on that, first of all, and I have a follow-up as well.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. I don't think there's a strong park rationale to combine SpaceX and Tesla, whereas there is for Tesla\nand SolarCity. It's really quite tenuous for SpaceX and Tesla.

First is just around\ncustomer deposits which were a source of cash in the quarter but looked to be about $288 million. As of\nMay, you had 373-ish (sic) [373,000-ish] Model S -- Model 3 preorders which would imply about a $375\nmillion inflow [indiscernible]. Could you maybe walk us between that number and what the actual change\nin deposits were? And in particular, where did Model 3 preorders end the quarter at?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSure. So in terms of thinking about the cash flow, yes, you're doing your math correctly, but we also\nrelease deposits when we deliver cars, so there's an inflow and there is an outflow there. And we had --\nthe deposits on the early Model X cars were larger than the later Model X cars as well, so that's one of the\nimpacts there as well. In terms of the Model 3 reservations, the 373,000 number that you reference is\nwhat we talked about when we did our secondary offering, and we're sticking to that number in terms of\ndisclosure.TESLA, INC. FQ2 2016 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 03, 2016\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nOkay. Second question around the shift from increased on-balance sheet captive lending. My quick\ncalculations, if you go up 8% in the back half off of your 50k guide, that seems to be, at 100k, about a\n$350 million cash need. And merely you're paying [ph] -- actually would be less with the cost of goods\nsold, call, $250 million, $280 million. Are you going to finance that out of your ABL? How quickly can you\nget another lease partner? And what do the amendments to the credit agreement for SolarCity kind of do\nto your ability to borrow against that for this captive financing?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSure. So in terms of -- the ABL is definitely available for some of that for sure. And then the overall\nliquidity position gives us confidence that we'll be able to do this. At the same time, we do have a lot --\nmany active discussions going on with other lease partners and we're looking at other ways to do this as\nwell. And I don't want to talk a lot about SolarCity on this call. That's not what it is, but they've got some\npretty advanced capability in thinking through how to walk through this as well.",

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson of Dougherty & Company.\nCharles Lowell Anderson\nDougherty & Company LLC, Research Division\nMy first question is around the sharing of vehicles described in the updated master plan. So if we're\nmoving from 5% to 10% utilization of the vehicle to some larger number, I wonder what you think the\nramifications of that might be on the number of cars that need to be produced every year. And then\nmaybe, the ramifications as it relates to the supercharger of the cars or the supercharger network, if the\ncars are always driving around? And then I have a follow-up.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, I think that the demand for autonomous cars will pass that way to the production capability. So I\nmean just want to bear in mind that the global fleets of vehicles is about 2.5 billion roughly and total new\nvehicle production ever year is only about 100 million. So the fleet's base would be turning over every\nroughly 20, 25 years. So if we -- we would have to make some truly enormous number of autonomous\nvehicles for there to be any demand saturation because it'll basically be the only car anyone wants to buy.\nCharles Lowell Anderson\nDougherty & Company LLC, Research Division\nAnd then for my second question, I wonder if you could clarify comments made on the last call about\ninverter technology. You mentioned having some of the best in the world for power electronics. So I\nwonder if you could just comment if that's the case that you will be making your own inverter. And if so,\nwhat will be the benefit to the overall system with your inverter technology versus what's used today?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. I think there's no question Tesla's going to do integrated inverter. Logically too, I think we've got\nthe most advanced inverter engineering team in the world. And so it makes sense to just as we do the\ninverters on vehicles to do it with solar as well and have it in a very tight package at a cents per watt level\nthat is, I think, probably twice as good as anyone else, I think maybe better than that. So that's like the\nobvious move there. And as part of what I was referring to is kind of an integrated product. I mean, if\nyou're -- if you put yourself in the consumer's shoes, you just want it to work. You don't want to know how\nit works, what you -- you don't care about the details. It's just got to work reliably, look good, not take up\na ton of space. The buying process has got to be easy, there's a -- you can check up on it with the app onTESLA, INC.

So that's what we're going to do.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And I think just add to that, I mean, when power electronics work well, you really don't even notice\nthem.

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nCan you just give an update of the Model S demand? In the press release, you indicated S and X orders\nwere up about 65% year-over-year, but if we look at deliveries and production of the S, it hasn't changed\nthat much since Q4 and you're rolling out the lower-priced 60 version. So if demand is up so much, why\noffer a lower-priced model and why hasn't production really been up that much more?\nJonathan McNeillTESLA, INC. FQ2 2016 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 03, 2016\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nSure. It's Jon, I'll give you a little bit of color on the demand which has been healthy for Model S in the\nsecond quarter and into the third quarter as well. As we mentioned in the shareholder letter, we didn't\nhave cars in the European market with the new refresh until the last month of the quarter. But despite\nthat, we had year-over-year growth in Model S demand and we also -- we had some very healthy growth\nin the markets where we had cars in stores. So we had double-digit growth in both North America and\nChina, really healthy growth in both of those markets. That growth has continued into the third quarter.\nBut one of the things that -- one of the reasons we introduced the 60 was we saw more Model 3 demand\nthan we anticipated, we talked about that last quarter. And a number of those reservation holders said\nto us we'd love to be in a Tesla today if you could provide a more affordable version of the Model S. Our\nbattery technology allows us to do that. And so we introduced the 60, and that's generated demand out\nof a new market segment. It is reaching down into that Model 3 reservation holder territory and portends\nreally good things for future Model 3 demand, but it's opened up a very nice segment for us for Model S.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. So whereas that -- like the -- people are not buying the base model, they're like -- they buy the\n60 and then they option it up quite a bit, so it ends up having like an average sale price and like over\n$80,000. And then since actually all the 60s actually have the 75 capacity, it's just software limited,\nthere's potential for them to upgrade over time and certainly, for the resell value of the car to be enhanced\nwhen it's returned to Tesla by unlocking the additional 15 kilowatt hours of that battery capability. But, I\nmean, I think in sort of a nutshell, the way to think about Tesla right now is that we're right around 2,000\ncars a week, and we try to balance the mix to be about roughly half X and S. There are some variations\ndepending upon regionality. Some parts of the world prefer more SUVs; some prefer more sedans. And we\ndo tend to batch up our cars, so this is why occasionally you see nonsensical articles about Tesla's demand\nsuddenly rising in some country or suddenly falling. It's got nothing to do with that; it's just happened to\nbe when the ship arrived. But high-level overview is just we see demand being fairly strong at an average\nof 2,000 cars a week, and we are able to maintain production at that level, notwithstanding occasional\nsupplier hiccups. And then hopefully, we can grow that a little bit towards the end of the quarter and then\na little more in Q4. And our aspiration, this unvarnished here [ph], this is just what we're aiming to do\ninternally, is to do a little better than 2,000 a week in sales and deliveries in Q4, combined S and X. I feel\nfairly optimistic about achieving that goal. Yes, I think our core business is actually doing quite well right\nnow.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nJust as a follow-up, any update on stationary storage? I think your original target for 400 million to 500\nmillion for this year and 2 million to 5 million for next year. Any just color on how that's trending.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nHeavily enduring production constraints. There were -- we've got some next-generation technology\nand we've got to school [ph] up that production line. So it's going to be heavily concentrated in Q4 and\nprobably even heavily in November and December, but it's -- I think it's going to be really exciting when\npeople see it. So that's why I expect kind of exponential growth from there. I think it's really going to go\nballistic.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, and we have been making quite a few background investments in the markets where we're growing,\nsetting up the teams and setting up to get ready for expanded product installation and distribution,\nespecially in places like Australia and in Germany.

So I think the way to think about warranty, and we put this in the shareholder letter, ongoing\nreserves is roughly consistent with what it's been, with what it was last quarter. And the RVG really\ndoesn't have an impact on warranty expense. Really, warranty expense is all about reliability and reliability\nis something that we are constantly monitoring.

Brinkman\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nThanks for taking my question which, I guess, is really for Elon. As Tesla grows very quickly and becomes\nincreasingly diversified, going from just the Model S to recently include the X and now, the 3 soon\nand you've added Tesla Energy to the mix now, SolarCity. So I'm really curious how you think about\nmanagement focus and attention and what you and your team are going to be doing to ensure strong\nexecution and focus as you head into the very important and, by your own admission, very challenging\nlaunch of the Model 3?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderTESLA, INC. FQ2 2016 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 03, 2016\nWell, I mean, the Model 3 is overwhelmingly our focus. Things are -- things feel really quite stable with\nS and X. We're kind of in the mode of continuous improvement, but no fundamental issues, so it's -- I\nfeel like the machine that's making X and S is actually functioning quite well right now and we're just -- I\ndefinitely burnt out a few neurons and a lot of other people solving the production ramp earlier this year.\nI feel we're in a good place at this point. So the focus really is on Model 3, followed by full autonomy as\nprobably the top 2 priorities.\nRyan J. Brinkman\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nOkay. And then the follow-up is as you're starting here in 3Q to ramp up the spending on both the\nGigafactory and the Model 3 development capacity, et cetera, are you seeing that one or the other, the\nModel 3 or the retrofit of Fremont, is providing more or less potential bottlenecks than the other in terms\nof getting to that July 1 Model 3 launch?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI don't actually know of any -- there's not any one standout issue for July 1. Now, I do want to -- I did say\nthis on the last earnings call, and I think it's probably better just reiterating because it's -- I mean, I think\nit makes sense to think about it, but it does require a bit of thinking about it. I don't expect us to be at full\nproduction on July 1, but I have to drive all suppliers and internal efforts to that date, knowing that some\nwill fall short. And if some fall -- and those that fall short, the suppliers that still fall short will be cut out\nof the picture. And if there are teams internally that failed to execute effectively, we will reorganize those\nteams. But if several thousand parts are not driven to a particular date, there is no chance of making any\npoint even past that date. So now, in an ideal world, this would be a confidential internal -- dry run [ph]\nwould be a confidential internal target. Given the amount of attention that Tesla receives and the fact\nthat there are several -- or if you count 2 or 3 -- 3 and 4 suppliers, there's several thousand companies\ninvolved. It's obviously impossible to keep that confidential, it's not -- you can't. So then, in order to have\na consistent message internally, knowing that, that message will also leak externally, that's where the July\n1 date comes from. There isn't any other way to do it. And if anybody's got better suggestions, I'd like\nto hear what they are. So I expect production to occur some point after July 1, and I don't -- but I don't\nknow what today would cause us to slip past that date. And if I did, I would take action to address it.",

Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure, so -- go ahead, Elon.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. So I was going to say, because people are optioning up the 60, it actually ends up being decent. I\nmean, it's not -- I mean, maybe it's sort of like 15% to 20% gross margin, whereas say, something like if\nsomebody orders the performance dual motor, that might actually be more like a 30%, 35% gross margin.\nBut there's just a small number of people that want high-performance cars and are willing to pay triple\ndigits or 6 more -- 6 digits, I should say, so -- but there also remains to be seen how many who order\nthe 60 then choose to do the upgrade to the 75 kilowatt hour rate. So there's going to be some number,\nit's too early to tell, of people who buy it at 60, realize they want the extra range, and then they canTESLA, INC. FQ2 2016 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 03, 2016\njust order a kind of like an in-app purchase on the car's screen and unlock it. I suspect we'll see a pretty\ndecent number of people do that but we don't -- it's still very early. So it's hard to say what number that\nwould be. And if they do, do that, then it will push gross margins up into the 20s, like in the mid-20s or\nsomething.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nOkay, that's helpful. And then just, Jason, maybe just 2 quick sort of housekeeping questions. CapEx,\nthe $2.25 billion, you're running a run rate that's less than half that for the first half of the year. So\njust curious how realistic that number is for the full year because you guys have committed to it in the\nshareholder letter again. And then also, the auto gross margin going up 200 to 300 basis points off of\nwhat base? I'm just -- it's not clear what base that's coming off of. I'm just trying to understand the exit\ngross margin for the year you're expecting.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. No problem. So, I mean, I want to add just a little bit of color onto the 60 gross margin\nnumbers, too. We're aspirational on those but the way to think about this is very important. Those cars\nare gross margin positive, and they're producing cash. So if you think about from an overall operating\nleverage perspective, even if the gross margin profile on those is less than our other variants, it's still\nproducing contribution margin to pay for the fixed cost of the business. So -- and it's the right economic\nthing to do. And even more importantly, it's right for the customer to continue to broaden the market\nthat way. On your 2 housekeeping questions, your questions on the CapEx front. As you heard in my\nopening comments, we are deadly focused on CapEx efficiency. So I think we can beat the $2.25 billion\nnumber, but we didn't see any need to update that guidance at this time. And then your question about\ngross margin on the basis, I was just looking at the quarter-over-quarter. In Q1, automotive gross margin\nexcluding ZEV credits was 20.1% and we expanded that to 21.9% in Q2 and it's expansion on both the X\nand the S variants.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nBut the 2 to 3 points of expansion in Q3 and Q4 is off the 21.9% basic second quarter?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nOh I see, you're asking about the forward-looking.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nYes.\nJason S.

So even 2 or 3 points on gross margin sequentially,\nthat seems below the prior guidance which you then called for 30% to exit the year on the Model S andTESLA, INC. FQ2 2016 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 03, 2016\n25% on the Model X. So is it related to the updated mix view on the 60? Was there something else going\non? Or what's the source of the change?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes. No, a couple of things there. And our previous guidance had been approaching 25% on X and\napproaching 30% on S. So I think we're maybe a quarter or 2 off on that, but you're pointing to the\nright things. One is just the mix shift that we're seeing with more Xs being produced. Those margins are\nhealthy and heading in the right direction, but they're obviously less than S. And now that we're halfway\nthrough the year too, we've talked a lot about just the production issues we've had overall. And those\ncertainly had an impact on the first half of the year and it's just difficult to make up for all of that in the\nnext 6 months. And then the impact, you talk about the 60s. The 60s may have some -- one other impact\non gross margin.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIt's pretty small though.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nPretty small, yes.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIt's pretty small. I mean, I'm cautiously optimistic that we'll actually meet those numbers by the end of\nthe year. Maybe not for Q4 as a whole but exiting Q4, I -- my best guess is we're just under 30% for S\nand around 25% for X by the end of this year. And that's what it looks like to me.\nJoseph Robert Spak\nRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And then, Elon, just as a philosophical question. I mean, as you transition to an in-house autopilot\nor autonomous solution, would you consider, in order to help build public support and confidence, about\nreleasing regular reports similar to like Google does on what the technology is doing and open the data?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, unfortunately and fortunately, I mean, Tesla can't sneeze without there being a national headline.\nSo I think you don't have to worry too much about whether we'll report it because the media will and then\ninflate it in size by 1,000. You know what I mean? Like last year, there were 35,000 automotive deaths in\nthe U.S. How many did you read about?\nJoseph Robert Spak\nRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nRight. I guess, maybe instead of public support, what about regulator support? I mean, what are the\nviews on sharing the data in that respect?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI mean, actually, with the regulators, we share the data well in advance of -- as soon as we know it. I\nmean, we shared the data regarding the state of Florida's fatality like a month, I don't know, so many\nweeks before it's an actually open investigation. In fact, I mean, we're not totally clear on why they open\nan investigation because they actually had all the information before they made a formal investigation.TESLA, INC.

I've heard and we saw obviously in the second quarter, there was\nsome lumpiness in the production and you ended up I think, with 50, 100-or-so vehicles in transit at\nthe end of the quarter. And I've heard Elon or Jason say stable or stabilization here a few times in the\ncall. Just want to get a sense for how we should be thinking about the back half deliveries and back half\nexpenses. Should it be relatively linear from here as we work toward, for example, your 30% year-over-\nyear expense guidance?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, I mean -- sorry, so I'll just start, say a few words and then Jason can address them. I mean basically,\nwe were in production hell for the first 6 months of this year. I mean, mean, it was hell. And then we\njust managed to sort of climb out of hell or -- in like basically part way through June and now we're --\nthe production line is humming. And our suppliers mostly have their sh*t together. There's a few that\ndon't. One of them, I know you're visiting on Saturday personally to figure out what the hell is going on\nthere, but we'll solve it. But I mean just like -- the thing that's crazy hard about cars is that there's several\nthousand unique items and you move as fast as the slowest item in the whole car. So yes, but that said,\nlike production is like -- it feels like we're -- I'm not losing sleep at night literally because of the production\nissues right now. 2,000 feels like a good number. That was like a slow steady increase in that number. And\nthen continue the cost efficiencies which help with gross margin. Some features that are going to come\nout, that will also help on the revenue side. And so I feel like actually really good about S and X right now.\nBut I get some -- a whole lot of mental scar tissue from the first 6 months this year. Jason?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I think, Elon, you covered it well. In terms of the modeling question, yes, I think it's kind of\nextrapolating from where we're at now. We're stable. We'll continue to get better on production\nthroughout the course of the year. We've got a couple more holiday weeks in Q4. You might want to think\nabout that when you're doing your modeling. But yes, I think Elon covered it well.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\nGreat, and if I may\u2026\nElon R.

Elon, I mean, as we think about the stages of autonomy, I believe NHTSA's sort of outlined sort of\n5 stages or 0 to 5. And we've seen some competitors of yours outline, with some detail, 2017 to 2020 to\n2022 type targets. How should we think about sort of your target? Or can you help us sort of dimension\na little bit more your targets in the past to level, I guess, 5? Let's assume for the moment that nothing's\nchanged, and given the accident in May. And if it has incrementally, that would be helpful but I just\nwanted to understand, I mean, in more detail, I think, how you plan to get to fully autonomous?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell. Again, major product announcements are not -- it's not -- you -- one shouldn't do those on an\nearnings call, obviously. So -- I mean all I would say is that full autonomy is going to come a hell a lot\nfaster than anyone thinks it will. And I think what we've got under development is going to blow people's\nminds.

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nI had a couple things. One is just following up on Tesla Energy. Can you talk a little bit about the business\npipeline, what's the mix of customers you're selling the product to? And is there a significant contingent\nof solar? And I wasn't clear on -- there was an earlier question on whether the business is still tracking to\naround 500 million this year. Could you just elaborate on that business line?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. It's heavily dependent on the production ramp in the last few months of the year. So the -- like,\nthere's definitely nothing even remotely close to demand constraints on the Tesla Energy side. It's entirely\ngetting the insuring done and getting it validated, getting your all [ph] certification, scaling up all elements\nof the supply chain, and being able to produce in volume. So the reason it's tricky to predict is because\nthe volume ramp looks an exponential. And so if you move the dates around even a little bit, it can quite\nsignificantly change what occurs in a quarter just because the production ramp is an exponential and\nshifts up a couple of weeks. It can make the quarter look low but actually, it's in vertical climb mode, so\nthe following quarter will look amazing. So what I'm highly confident of is that the next-generation of\nstationary storage is head and shoulders above anything else that I've even heard announced as future\nplans from other companies. So it's not -- and so we just got to build those damn things.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nYes. The customers that you're anticipating, are there significant kind of renewables in there? Is it\ncommercial, residential? What are you sort of seeing or affects the above?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, it's -- we just got to -- we got to scale up production. And production is a hard thing, it's real hard,\nparticularly when it's new technology. If it's some standard technology that's been made for a long time,\nit's fine. It's cutting-edge technology, it's really hard to scale up reduction. Because you got to design the\nmachine that makes the machine, not just the machine itself and -- but the results can be amazing. This\nis -- like I said, it's going to be head and shoulders above anything else that's -- it's better than anything\nI've heard anyone even announce that they will do in the future, and we will do it in the present.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionTESLA, INC.

Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, absolutely.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nTypically, as I'm sure you know, the bottlenecks in auto manufacturing are really not in the automated\nfunctions like the body shop. They're in things like final trim and assembly that are more labor-intensive,\nand you've got people crawling in and out of vehicles. Do you see a significant step-function improvement\nthere like inside-out manufacturing or something like that? And is that something that we're going to see\non the Model 3?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nThe Model 3, I mean, the internal name for the designing machine that makes the machine is the --\nwhat we call the alien dreadnought. At the point at which the factory looks like an alien dreadnought,\nthen you know you've won. It's like what the hell is that? So we've got alien dreadnought version 0.5\nis -- will be Model 3. It'll take us another year to get the version 1 and probably, a major version every\n2 years thereafter. By version 3, it won't look like anything else. It might look like a giant chip picking\nplace machine or a super high-speed bottling or canning plant. And you really can't have people in the\nproduction line itself. Otherwise, you automatically drop to people speed. There's still a lot of people at the\nfactory but what they're doing is maintaining the machines, upgrading them, dealing with anomalies. But\nthere's -- but in the production process itself, there essentially would be no people. But not -- with version\n1, not version 0.5, so -- but I don't feel or think oh, it's just Tesla's going to have a factory without people.\nThere's going to be a huge number of people, but they will be maintaining the machines and upgrading\nthe machines and dealing with anomalies, and the output per person will be extraordinarily high.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nSounds like a lot of innovation there.

I guess, just an accounting question maybe for Jason. With the residual value guarantee going\naway, what happens to the accounting for revenues? Do you kind of get to something more close to what\nwe see in other OEM financials and maybe just have the portion that's direct lease be accounted for as\nleases? And what would be the timing of changes assuming they do have them?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ2 2016 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 03, 2016\nYes. No, absolutely, and the answer to timing, it changes right away. So a car that is sold without in -- so\nwith an RVG, that drops us into lease accounting. And what we've done historically and we'll continue to\ndo for RVGs is we recognize the full revenue on a non-GAAP basis. What changes when there's not an RVG\nin the equation is you get full revenue recognition on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis. So good\nthings happen on the accounting side.\nPatrick Kenehan Archambault\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nOkay. And then this is something that, I mean, within the next quarter or something, you'll -- we'll already\nsee a significant reduction in that adjustment, obviously.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYou'll see that but the other thing I want to point you to is what we've already talked about and probably\nan uptake in direct leasing. When we have used a partner in the past for leasing, that gives us non-GAAP\nrevenue recognition on that. Our non-GAAP revenue recognition is very simple, we follow the cash. If\nsomebody pays us for -- pays us cash for a car, we recognize it in non-GAAP revenue. When we do direct\nleasing, then that drops us in to pure lease accounting so there, it will be that way on a GAAP and a non-\nGAAP basis.\nPatrick Kenehan Archambault\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nAnd I mean, is the 8 to 15, is that just kind of a temporary measure while you're setting up these new\npartner relationships? Or do you actually expect to stay at 15 for some time?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSo 15 is what we're talking about for Q3 and I think I mentioned earlier, we've got a bunch of active\nconversations with new partners. There's another factor too which is I think, important to point out. We've\nintroduced some pretty compelling loan programs, particularly in North America in the last 90 days. And\nwe're starting to see some shift from leasing towards loans. And to bring the answer to your question full\ncircle, loan is full GAAP and full non-GAAP revenue recognition.\nPatrick Kenehan Archambault\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nGot it, that's helpful, and I think it will be helpful for just the users of financial statements as well. The\nZEV credits, you mentioned that they weren't material. I feel like it's been written that there was kind of\na glut of supply on those. And I don't know, is that just the lumpiness of it or is that sort of a revenue\nprocess that's going nowhere?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell actually, if I could say something and I really want to emphasize this quite strongly and I hope it\ndoes get picked up in the media, is that the California Air Resources Board is being incredibly weak in its\napplication of ZEV credits. The standards are pathetically low. They need to be increased. There's massive\nlobbying by the big car companies to prevent CARB from increasing the ZEV credits mandate which they\nabsolutely damn well should; it's a crying shame that they haven't.

The first one is on the sharing\npiece. So definitely, a very exciting goal. At the same time, I feel like a lot of automakers as well as\nmunicipalities are all working sort of like on their version of sort of ride sharing through autonomous, I\nguess, driverless cars. And to the extent that a lot of sort of what buyers are looking at in Tesla now is the\ndriving experience and that it really doesn't matter as much when you're being driven, what do you view\nas sort of your future competitive advantage in a sort of like ride-sharing type of environment?\nElon R.

So it's -- I don't think cars are going to\njust become some boring utility.\nEmmanuel Rosner\nCLSA Limited, Research Division\nGot it. And I guess on the piece about expanding the product line out to other major segments. What do\nyou view as your target timing for that? I know there was a mention of some of these cars being sort of\nlike -- I guess, at least sort of like available sort of like to be unveiled next year. So does that mean that\nwe're looking at sort of like the following year, or is that into the next decade? And what sort of, I guess,\ncapital needs that we're looking at for that?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI think we want to postpone anything that's a heavy capital impact until after the Model 3 production\nis ramped. We don't want to stack Model 3 CapEx on top of other program CapEx, so -- but there's a\nlot we can do. Because the development of a vehicle, there's a long sort of tail at the beginning of the\ndevelopment of a vehicle which involves a lot of time but doesn't involve a lot of cost. And it's only when\nyou begin tooling up full production that the cost really ramps dramatically. So there's a lot we can do\nbefore that -- before we have to sort of dive into ramp CapEx. And we won't do that for any products\nuntil after Model 3 is in high production, yes. But I think there's going to be some pretty exciting unveils\nfor the Tesla semi and the Tesla minibus or bus. We have actually -- we don't actually have a name for it\nyet. That's just off of the Model X platform. So it doesn't involve a lot of CapEx actually. But we expect to\nprobably unveil those, I think, for the middle of next year, maybe in the next 6 to 9 months type of thing.\nAnd then have a better -- a more fleshed out plan for when those would enter production. But it's not --\nthey would enter production within like, low single-digit years, not like -- I mean, I consider like anything\npast 5 years is infinity. Yes, and so I'd say, I mean, also to be clear. Like, the priority vehicle development\nafter the Model 3 would be the Model Y, I guess, the compact SUV because that's also a car that where we\nexpect to see demand in the 500,000 to 1 million units per year level.

One, can you discuss when you expect to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis?\nAnd then #2, you had mentioned on the last call that the Gigafactory may actually have the ability to\nproduce about 3 times of your original estimate? Will that entail significant CapEx in the future or are you\npreparing that foundation right now to reach over 100 gigawatt hours?\nJason S. WheelerTESLA, INC. FQ2 2016 EARNINGS CALL  AUG 03, 2016\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. On the profitability question, just reiterate what Elon said earlier. If we can execute on our\nproduction and our delivery goals in the second half of the year, we've got a great chance to be non-GAAP\nprofitable.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, clearly Model 3 CapEx. The real question on profitability is where do we set the dial on growth? And\nobviously, if you set the dial on growth to be super high, then you'd face dilution because of that increased\ncapital. If you set it too low, there's less dilution but then you grow slower. So you want to set it at kind\nof the right level where you're the right mix of dilution and growth. I mean, as it is, it's just important\nto bear in mind like, as a manufacturing company, our percentage growth, I think it's unprecedented\nin the modern era. It's really nutty. I mean, in 2010, we were making 600 cars a year, and Lotus was\ndoing most of the -- was doing the chassis -- body and chassis. And then 5 years later, we were making\n50,000. And it was a much more sophisticated car to Model X, and we were doing the whole car without\nany partner. So when you have like, in same percentage growth like that in a manufacturing company,\nit's not like you're shipping copies of software here. It's a real tricky, strategic business to where do you\nset things from a dilution versus growth standpoint. So I mean, the right way to look at the product line,\nthe companies -- look at say the product lines and say -- and value them as that -- sort of do an NPV of\nthe product lines. And then, for any given product line, you can say, okay, this is what that is likely to be\nworth, the S, the X, the 3. And then you can parse it out relative to the CapEx on new vehicles. And to\nthe degree that the past predicts the future, then you can pretty much count on, like, the new vehicle\nprogram also being incredibly valuable. And something where it would be mad not to spend the money to\ndo it. But it can be -- when all of that's kind of lumped together, it can be confusing. And then people will\nthink Tesla is a money-losing company. Like, well not really. Not if you're growing at like 100% a year or in\nthe case of next year, I mean, our unit volume, we'll probably exit next year at unit volumes that's 200%\nor 300% what our current volume is, maybe 400%. So it's just real important to parse things out and\nto understand what the real health of the business is. Right now, I mean, in a nutshell, we're like we're\nshipping $10 billion a year of product on an annualized basis at somewhere around a 23% to 25% gross\nmargin.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nAnd just quickly to your Gigafactory question, this is J.B. A lot of the improvements that we've made\nare actually increasing the density of the Gigafactory and the density of how much equipment and\n[indiscernible] in the existing footprint. So in that case, there's a lot of investments we've already made\npreparing the site, some of the infrastructure for the site that we would get to continue leveraging as we\ngrow capacity even higher than our original plan. There would be some other investments, of course,\nand equipments and things like that, that would be incremental, tied to that much higher volume, but\nthose would also be enabling vehicle volumes and energy product volumes way beyond what we'd initially\npredicted.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nAll right, guys. We're at the hour mark. Shall we call it a day? Yes. Let's do it. All right. Thanks a lot,\neverybody, for joining us and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Bye-bye.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nThanks a lot. Bye.",
