I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ3 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Paci\ufb01c Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent \ufb01lings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. All right. So Q3 was our best quarter in history. We achieved record production anddeliveries, record revenue, record net income, both GAAP and non-GAAP, and record free cash\ufb02ow of $1.4 billion. This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team. I could not bemore proud to work with such a great group of people. Just really (expletive) performance across --throughout the world.Of course, we had our Battery Day. So we hosted -- showed our"

There's only -- acomment I made in the past is that I think Tesla's long-term competitive strength will be primarilymanufacturing. This is counterintuitive, but I'm quite con\ufb01dent this will be what happens.All right. So we presented what the team has been working on for a long time with batteries. Wewanted to step back and really rethink batteries from scratch. First principles thinking, just look at itfrom fundamental physics and say what -- rather than compare to other products in the market, justsay from a physics standpoint, if you -- what's the limit of physics? What's the platonic idea of aperfect cell and how close can we get there? And that was our aspiration. And I think we've got apretty good approach to it, which will only get better over time. And we went through all of theinteresting solutions for every important part of battery design and production. And we'll continueto iterate on that and just recursively improve the core cell and battery technology. The result, we think, in"

And we expect Giga Berlin will see our\ufb01rst battery cell production line at scale.Regarding the Full Self-Driving beta release. The Autopilot team, again, just a really all-star team. Ispent a lot of time with the Autopilot team. And there's a lot of really talented people in that teamwho've worked incredibly hard to make the -- to get the beta release out. So I'd just really like tothank them for their hard work. And it's just a very smart group of people. So I think we're startingvery slow and very cautiously because the world is a complex and messy place. And so we're -- weput it out there last night, and then we'll see how it goes and then probably release it to more peoplethis weekend or early next week. And then just gradually step it up until we have, hopefully, a widerelease by the end of this year.And of course, as the system collects more data and -- it becomes more robust. So it's sort of likehow does Google as a search engine get better."

Having on theorder of 1 million cars that are providing feedback and speci\ufb01cally feedback on strange corner casesituations that you just can't even come up with in simulation, this is the thing that is reallyvaluable. It's not like the obvious stuff, obvious stuff you can do in simulation. But weird cornercases, only a reality can give you that. So that's -- but we're able to say, okay, we need to train thesystem on this corner case situation and look for examples so we can then try it against thoseexamples and improve some very esoteric corner cases.And it's also important to emphasize that this is a generalized neural net-based approach. There isno need for high-de\ufb01nition maps or a cellphone connection. So the car -- the system is designedsuch that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you're in a place that you have neverbeen to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like"

We're continuingto expand Shanghai signi\ufb01cantly, which is going incredibly well. The Tesla China team is just, Imean, incredibly good. Super smart, work hard. It's like I'm always amazed by how much progressthe Tesla China team makes. It's beyond all reasonable expectations.And then we're under construction in Berlin and Texas -- and Austin. So we're also making goodprogress there. Yes. Good. It's overall going well. I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin,we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next year. But because of the exponentialnature of the spool up of a manufacturing plant, especially one with new technology, it will start offvery slow at \ufb01rst and then become very -- upward, will become very large. Just in general,manufacturing follows the S-curve. And I think sometimes, people, if they haven't spent a lot oftime manufacturing, kind of think that once you have a factory, you can just sort of turn it on andit's at capacity. But it will typically take about 12 to 18 months to reach capacity."

On net income, we achievedour \ufb01fth sequential quarter of pro\ufb01tability, our best net income, and nearly double-digit operatingmargins.Two things that are important to note to set context for Q3 pro\ufb01tability. First, the regulatory creditsbusiness was stronger than our expectations, and we are tracking to more than double this yearcompared to last. Second, as a result in the rise of the market cap of the company, the second andthird tranche of the CEO grant vested during the quarter. Additionally, we have begun expensing 1more tranche, resulting in roughly $300 million of combined period expense.I think it's reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the healthof the core business.On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from 18.7% to23.7%, with some of our programs achieving greater than 25% gross margin.

This isdriven by an increase in in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturingas well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future.

The \ufb01rst questionfrom retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start 4680 cell production at Giga Berlin at the sametime as vehicle production? Can Tesla share more information on what products will use the batterycells from the pilot line in Fremont?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Drew, do you want to take that?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSure. Yes, we will incorporate 4680 design solutions into many applications in time across bothenergy and vehicle.

Does it improvethe required taper curve?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. The fundamental limitation on charge rate in lithium-ion batteries is avoiding lithium platingon the anode. And while the tabless architecture helps avoid overheating because it's a more power-dense architecture at high continuous charge rates, it doesn't change the anode plating story. Electrodesign and anode material choice more directly determines the maximum charge rate and how toavoid that lithium plating problem."

What products are going to make your life better? What future doyou want?

Could you envision any ofthem ever spinning out from Tesla?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, yes, as I think about this today, I mean Tesla is probably -- there's in excess of a dozen start-ups effectively in Tesla. Every major product line is a start-up. Every new -- big new plant is a start-up. And sometimes, frankly, we have to learn the lesson a few times before it sinks in. But eventhings like service and sales are start-ups. Other car companies, OEMs, they don't own their salesand service. So we have to create our service network. We have to create our sales and deliverynetwork. We have to do this in, I don't know, 40 countries, multiple languages. Something thatpeople don't really even know much about is our internal applications team that writes the coretechnology that runs the company.We are not dependent on enterprise software.

You can have the car be -- share with friendsand family. You can add or remove it from the network. You can have it be entirely in the network. Imean if you're an Uber or Lyft driver, you could be managing a \ufb02eet of 10 cars. This sort of seemslike a shepherd tending the \ufb02ock type of thing. It's like you just get more, way more leverage. So Ithink that's sort of -- we could do that.

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringI was just going to say, I mean, I think one of the things we focused on with the Model Y and nowModel 3 heat pump system was learning how to build a tightly integrated system capable of movingheat to and from anywhere really, powertrain, battery, cabin, the environment, in -- outside ambienttemperatures, all the way down to like negative 20 C, so 30 C.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely. I think like the heat -- for heat pump in the car, being able to use the batteries bothas a thermal and an electric energy reservoir is very signi\ufb01cant. Same thing could be applied to ahome with the water heater, so -- and the back of pack itself, of course. So I think there's potentialfor an integrated home system that kind of does power generation/storage, heating/cooling, air\ufb01ltration, water puri\ufb01cation in a really tight package.

So it is important to lower the prices in order to -- suchthat people can literally just have enough money to buy it.

Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of wheredirectionally Model Y and China Model 3 gross margin was in the quarter relative to FremontModel 3?

On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release. It'snot particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter. With respect to product margins,what we're seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really across every product.Shanghai continues to make good progress there. Model Y cost is also coming down quite quicklyas we ramp that. But we've guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to theModel 3 built in Fremont costs. It's not quite there, and it's also a bit of a moving target. As Model 3Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to come down with that. But we're generally seeingstrength in Shanghai margin, strength in Model Y margins. And not too far off of this, we're seeingstrength in Model 3 Fremont, S and X margins.

We continue the development of the Semi. And in particular, Megachargers, we realized thatthe 350-kilowatt or so that we might be looking for cars is not going to be enough for Semi.
