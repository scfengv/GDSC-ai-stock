        "paragraph3": "But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nThanks, Martin. On Monday, we hosted our first-ever Autonomy Investor Day, showcasing our new in-\nhouse designed full self-driving computer and our AI-based software trained by more than 400,000\nTesla vehicles. All Tesla cars being built today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving, and\nover the year updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate\nincome which, as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago, we think is somewhere between $10,000\nand $30,000 a year, in some cases, perhaps more. We're the only company in the world producing our\nown vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for full self-driving. We're in a position unlike\nanyone else in the industry. And in 2020, we expect to have 1 million robotaxis on the road with the\nhardware necessary for full self-driving. We believe we'll have the most profitable autonomous taxi on\nthe market and perhaps the -- yes. Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume\nin Europe, similar to what North America experienced last year as well as a massive increase in delivery\nvolume to China.\nAs far as challenges go, this was a good one to have because we booked vehicles and consumers bought\nthem, but this rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resulted in over half\nof our global deliveries occurring in the final 10 days of Q1.\nThis was the most difficult logistics problem I've ever seen, and I've seen some tough ones. So I'll say\nit again, equipment fleet delivered the half of all vehicles produced -- delivered all half -- all deliveries\noccurred literally in the final 10 days of Q1.\nAs a result, a large number of vehicles -- the vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2 which, of course, Q1 net\nincome to be negatively impacted. As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customers specifically in\ntime. In response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle booked throughout\nthe quarter. This will make the -- this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery\nexperience for customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the\nquarter.\nIn Q1, Model 3 was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner-up by almost\n60%. It's worth to dwell on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared to predictions that were\nmade several years ago. There were literally, to the best of my knowledge, 0 predictions that this wouldTESLA, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL  APR 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5happen, if you go back just even 5 or 6 years ago, that an electric car would be the best-selling premium\ncar in the U.S. And we believe, over time, we'll be the best-selling premium car throughout the world.\nAnd in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever. And that'd be\nsomething similar in Switzerland as well. So these were really incredible achievements by the Tesla team.\nSince the introduction of Standard Range and Standard Range Plus, nearly 70% of trade-ins from Model\n3 have actually been nonpremium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car than they have ever\npaid for a car. They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model 3 more\nthan they ever wanted a vehicle, they're willing to pay more to get a Model 3.\nAnd keep in mind, global expansion for the Model 3 has just begun, and this segment is vastly larger\ninternationally than it is in the U.S. We're continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle\nlineup, including updating the Model S and X production line to accommodate the next generation of\npowertrains. So we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with the significantly more\nbalanced powertrains for the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to the suspension system to have active\nadaptive damping in the suspension system and to enable charging at 200 kilowatts, which is -- and there\nare a number of other small changes. If anyone is thinking about upgrading their Model S or X, this is a\ngreat time to do it. And we also introduced the loyalty program where if somebody has -- is an existing\nTesla owner and they buy a performance Model S or X, they get the Ludicrous upgrade for free. So this is\n-- yes, as a thank you and an appreciation to existing Tesla customers.\nSo they have a longer range. The Model S now has a range of 370 miles. This is actually EPA range of\n370 miles, and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop all the way from San\nFrancisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds. And they said they could have even gone faster. And\nthere weren't any headwind as well. So this is pretty remarkable that an electric car could go nonstop\nbetween the 2 biggest cities in California. I mean, I remember back when I was driving gasoline cars, I\nalways had to stop at a gas station. This is literally better than a gasoline car with the rare exception. And\nthere's also an increase in power. It accelerates faster. Just better, better in every way. And we're able to\nthis without increasing the size of the battery pack, which is a testament to the powertrain team for it to\nbe able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain by such a significant margin.\nSo with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continued expansion\nof Model 3 globally, we expect our order rate to increase significantly throughout the year and\ncommensurate with our production levels. And in terms of other products, I'm very excited about the\nfuture for other products, especially for full self-driving, which will fundamentally transform transport as\nwe know it; the Tesla Semi truck; Model Y; improvements to Powerwall; Powerpack; the Solar Roof version\n3 on the energy side. And no question in my mind that Tesla has the most exciting product road map of\nany consumer product company in the world.\nAnd finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for their continued\nsupport.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you very much, Elon. And I think Zach -- Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, thank you, Martin, and thanks, Elon, as well. Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, this\nwas one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in the history of the company. And it was\nambitious even by Tesla's own standard. The global expansion of Model 3 was a huge theme within the\nquarter. We launched the Standard Range lineup for Model 3, product retooling for Model S and Model\nX, which Elon just talked about with the range enhancements and suspension upgrades, and then we\nimplemented various pricing adjustments and worked to do the corresponding impact that had on our\norder mix in deliverable cars. So there's 2 key themes that I'd like to discuss briefly, and then we'll open it\nup to Q&A, around cash and profitability for the quarter.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL  APR 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. This was a\n$1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to 2 factors. The\nfirst is that we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1. Note for those of you looking to the cash\nflow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows. The balance to the $1.5\nbillion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model 3 operations\noverseas. And the 2 components to this which we have discussed, is that an international operation\nnaturally commands additional working capital because of transit times, but then also the stress on our\ndelivery operations meant that not all of our cars will be delivered. Both of these factors which occurred\nin Q1 we do not expect to repeat in Q2. And we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to\nincrease going forward. I'll also note that we're tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries for a\nmonth 1 in the history of the company.\nOn the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of\nthe quarter. This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then\nU.S. local builds in the second half. This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEA and China and\nsignificantly stressed the delivery operations. Note, we also faced import issues in Shanghai and Beijing\nand worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries towards the final couple of days and weeks\nin the quarter. So we're addressing this by regionally on balance -- by building regionally balanced, and\nwe've already executed on this for Model 3, and S and X will be implemented in the next week or 2.\nThe secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter. So we\ndon't have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the peak. We expect significant\ncost savings to come from this.\nOn the P&L side, we incurred $188 million of one-time adjustments that flowed through to net income.\n$120 million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February 28. This\nincluded a reserve for a potential increased return rate for our Residual Value Guarantee and Buyback\nGuarantee of vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of our used Tesla inventory and\nservice deliveries. There's an additional $67 million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges that\nflowed through.\nWithin the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was\nnegatively impacted by $501 million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted. If you\nadjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline in deliveries.\nWithin automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately 28 -- to 20%.\nThis is due to 2 factors. One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February 28 as well as a mix shift\ntowards the Standard Range lineup which we launched. We also successfully executed on a number of cost\nreductions which offset this impact. Labor content, warehousing and scrap, as examples, all had double-\ndigit improvements from Q4 to Q1.\nIn spite of launching the Standard Range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs are close to\n$50,000, with the majority of our orders being for long-range variants of Model 3.\nIn S and X, the impact on margin was more significant. Two major pieces here: the volume reduction led\nto a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our margin as well as the pricing actions that we\ntook on February 28. Even though S and X had been in production for a while, we still continue to make\noperational improvements there, the labor content as an example, which improved quarter-over-quarter.\nAs we look to the future here, I agree with Elon's sentiments about the excitement of our product lineup.\nBut from a financial standpoint, what we've effectively done here is build an incredible base of knowledge\nand assets that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around the world.\nSo Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this. As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing up capacity\n50% for Giga Shanghai as compared to the Model 3 in the U.S., and that 50%, our internal forecast that\nwe're executing against, is actually better than that.\nAnd Model Y, as we've noted, is built on the Model 3 platform, so we're able to leverage the knowledge\nthere for capital-efficient expansion.TESLA, INC.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7In energy as well, as we've noted previously, 2019 is a big year for storage, so a lot of exciting\nimprovements coming there. And the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilize some of\nthe assets that we've made investments in that.\nSo just to conclude the opening remarks here, I've personally never felt more excited about the future of\nthe company, and I'm looking forward to the discussion.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you very much, Zachary. Let's take some first questions from retail shareholders who have been\nsubmitting their questions on say.com.So the first question is, will Tesla be able to complete their purchase\nof Maxwell Technologies? What is holding that back?TESLA, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL  APR 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8Question and Answer\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nJonathan, do you want to?\nJonathan A. Chang\nVice President of Legal & General Counsel\nYes, it's Jonathan Chang, Legal Counsel here. Right now, we're just going through approvals with the\nSEC. There's not a whole lot of things holding it back. We're on schedule. We're on track. Right now, we're\nlooking to close in mid-May.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you. The second question is, is Tesla considering and creating an insurance program in order to\nfurther simplify the ownership experience and to more accurately take into account safety of driving an\nAutopilot? The insurance market is very unreliable for Tesla owners right now.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nThe answer is, yes, we are creating a Tesla insurance product, and we hope to launch that in about a\nmonth. It will be much more compelling than anything else out there.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nGreat. Thank you very much. The next question is, Elon, most people when they think of Tesla only see\nit as an automotive company. Can you speak to the energy side of the company, specifically the road\nmap for when you see the energy side of things really taking off and generating major revenue for the\ncompany?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nSure. The challenge really is battery cell scarcity. As far as the stationary storage is concerned, we\nbasically need an upsell to support the vehicle production as well as to both Powerwall and Powerpack.\nLast year, in order to have enough cells for Model 3, we actually had to convert all of the lines of the\nGigafactory to produce cells just for the Model 3 as opposed to Powerwall, Powerpack. And so we're\nessentially scrounging cells from all around the world to, at least, continue some level of production on the\nPowerwall and Powerpack. This year, we think that we'll be able to allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of\ncell outputs. [ I incur ] J.B., like what do you guys think?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes, something like that.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nBetween 5% and 10%, exactly that.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL  APR 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9Elon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes. So there are far fewer cells in a Powerwall than in a car, so that translates to quite a decent number\nof Powerwalls. And then we will continue to use cells from various suppliers around the world. The\nPowerwall and Powerpack, because they don't have to go through vehicle homologation, are much more\nadaptable to using a variety of cells from other cell providers. So are we expecting that Powerwall and\nPowerpack to see a very significant percentage growth this year, maybe on the order of 300% or some\nquite high number. Sorry? Sorry? Yes, 300%. I guess he was just confirming it, 300%. So this is a very\nbig percentage growth rate. It's much faster than an automotive. So over time, we would expect that to\n-- that sort of growth rate we hope will be able to continue and then battery storage will become a bigger\nand bigger percentage of Tesla's business over time. We also have -- we're also planning a significant\nincrease in retrofit solar this year because we've finally refined the product offering to be something\nthat's extremely compelling and much more cost efficient to deliver and install. So a radically streamlined\nprocess from what has been done before, and we'll have more to say on that possibly next week. And then\nthe Solar Roof tile, we're on version 3 of the design. That necessarily takes a while to scale up because\nwe have to be confident that the Solar Roof is going to last for on the order of 30 years and because the\nwarranty is sort of 20, 25 years. And so the rate at which you can iterate on Solar Roof is necessarily\nslowed down by the -- according to the rate which you can do accelerated aging on the roof. And we want\nthe installation process to be simple and easy. So I was just actually at the Buffalo -- Tesla Buffalo factory\na few weeks ago and I was pretty impressed with the team, and we're looking forward to scaling that up\nsignificantly through the balance of this year and next.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you very much. The next question comes from [ Jeffrey ]. When and where will the Tesla Semi\nproduction begin?\nJerome Guillen\nPresident of Automotive Division\nThis is Jerome. Next year, we'll start production. We're very happy. We're driving the trucks extensively\nwith, I think, so far quite amazing success, yes.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nThe prototypes are working amazingly well.\nJerome Guillen\nPresident of Automotive Division\nYes, very well. We just use them all the time. We load them to the maximum weight and continue to make\nimprovements. So...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nWe even used them to deliver some Model 3s.\nJerome Guillen\nPresident of Automotive Division\nYes, that was fun. So yes, we'll start production next year. The location is not yet set, but it's pretty clear\nthat we make all the batteries and [ driving units ] in Reno.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nGreat. Thank you very much.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL  APR 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Elon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nThat was Sparks, technically.\nJerome Guillen\nPresident of Automotive Division\nYes, Sparks. Yes. Northern Nevada.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes, Northern Nevada.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nAnd perhaps the last question from retail. How soon should current owners that purchased FSD get the\nnew FSD computer?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nI think the -- from features and functionality standpoint, I think there's no point getting the FSD upgrade\nif you don't really have it in the car for probably about 2 or 3 months. That's when we'll start releasing\nfeatures that are materially different from the feature set available on the version 2 hardware. So just\nno need to rush to the -- get your computer replaced. It's like 2 to 3 months before it becomes relevant.\nAnd then it will obviously increase rapidly from then. One other comment I'll make in case, since nobody\nasked this explicitly. For Model Y production, we are right now trying to decide whether Model Y vehicle\nproduction should be in California or Nevada, and we expect to make a final decision on that very soon.\nBut in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling and equipment required for Model Y. So we don't\nexpect this to, in any way, delay production of Model Y, but it's currently a very close call between Nevada\nand California as to whether we do the Model Y at Giga or at Fremont. But those are the 2 options, and\nhopefully, we'll be able to make a decision in the next few weeks.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you very much. Cherie, we can go to analyst questions in the question queue."

        "paragraph4": "Our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.\nRyan J. Brinkman\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nYour guidance for 90,000 to 100,000 2Q deliveries when combined with the full year outlook, it suggests\nsomewhere between 35% and 45% sequential growth from the first half to the second. Can you talk\nabout what is giving you the confidence to project that growth? And in particular what the order book or\nreservation list may be telling you?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes. The -- we do see strong demand for vehicles, the -- both S, X and 3. The Standard Range Plus Model\n3 with Autopilot included at $39,500 is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and affordable to probably\nsomething on the order of like the top 40% income earners in the U.S. and Europe. So it's -- I think we'll\nsee a lot of interest and demand in that. We are. And then with the upgraded S and X, I think a lot of\npeople were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X upgrade, and this really is kind of a game\nchanger of an upgrade. So I think we are seeing an uptick in demand, and we expect to see that to beTESLA, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL  APR 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11quite significant. So -- and we're also out of the seasonality of Q1 with a few people just generally don't\nlike buying cars in winter, and we're getting past the overhang of that tax credit cliff which, for us, ended\nin the U.S. on December 31. So these were all very positive factors. We also have just a lot of markets\nwhere there's -- where we haven't yet tapped into demand, especially for Model 3. So we'll be releasing\nthe right-hand drive Model 3 and expect to see significant demand in right-hand drive countries. Overall, I\nfeel really good about where things are headed.\nRyan J. Brinkman\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nOkay. And then my follow up -- I'm sorry...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\n[indiscernible]...\nRyan J. Brinkman\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nI was just going to say, on a previous call, you indicated that the Y would not be built in Fremont because\nit was, I think you said, packed to the gills. I heard today that it is now a close call between California and\nNevada. Is anticipated demand for Fremont-built vehicles less than was previously thought? Or have you\nmanaged to maybe find more capacity in Fremont, for example, with the tent or some other production\nmethod?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nWell, first of all, obviously, on kind of tents, like I mean, real like hardcore tents, so not like Cub Scout\ntents, which are fine. But this is actually -- credit goes to a number of Tesla team because they actually\nlook at how could we do this in Fremont if we had to, and we feel that we can actually append building\nspace to the -- basically to the west side of the building and use a lot of internal space that's currently\nused for warehousing in the Fremont factory. And so we believe it actually can be done with minimal\ndisruption to add Model Y to Fremont."

        "paragraph5": "Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.\nPierre C. Ferragu\nNew Street Research LLP\nMy first question is really on the Model S and Model X and, Elon, you say you're comfortable with them.\nYou see -- based on what you saw in April, do you think that the 25,000 units per quarter is the level\nof demand that is where you see the market coming back already? Or are we not there yet? And more\nspecifically, in the U.S., the pull forward in Q4 could hurt a lot of demand for S and X? Is that something\nthat you still see in the numbers today in recent weeks? Or is that behind us? And I'll have a follow-up on\nQ2.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes. I mean, I think something like the -- returning to the 100,000 a year annualized demand for S and X\nis what we anticipate. That's to the best of my knowledge. We don't have a crystal ball, but that's probably\nour best guess. And sorry, what was the other part?\nPierre C. Ferragu\nNew Street Research LLPTESLA, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL  APR 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12My question was about the run rate of demand you see at the moment. Do you still feel like weak demand\nin the U.S. because of the pull forward in Q4? Or do you think demand returned to normal already?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nI think we expect demand to -- we are seeing demand returning to normal in Q2. And it might be a little\nbetter than normal. It's -- I don't have a crystal ball, so it's hard for me to say, but my impression right\nnow is that demand is quite solid, quite strong, yes.\nPierre C. Ferragu\nNew Street Research LLP\nAnd then my second question was briefly on the...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nSorry, Zachary would probably like to...\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. But just one thing I wanted to add to that, just on the production side of S and X. We did reduce\nproduction in Q1, as was noted. That was part of the retooling that we put in place to get the longer-\nrange vehicle out with the improved suspension. And we're in the process of increasing production back\nup over the course of Q2. So just for the purpose of expectations, I mean, we will exit Q2 at a higher\nproduction rate than we did in Q1 on S and X and then return back to a more normal volume in Q3. I think\nit's already increasing.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes. Yes.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. What was your second question?\nPierre C. Ferragu\nNew Street Research LLP\nAnd my third...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nPart of the S, X. Yes -- S, X, yes. Or by an S, X. Yes.\nPierre C. Ferragu\nNew Street Research LLP\nAnd my follow-up was really on Q2 like with 90,000 to 100,000 units, you're getting back to fairly nice\nvolumes, and I'm surprised you don't -- you still expect a loss. So maybe if you could take us through\nwhere we will see in Q2 pain points compared to Q4 and Q3, where you had a profit for similar volumes.\nHow much of the loss in Q2 would be the one-off costs? How much is the price points coming down in the\nmix? And how much is related to pricing and other things?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectTESLA, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL  APR 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 13Sure. So quite a bit -- but we think if we didn't unwind or pulled the wave where we, yes, made cars in the\nfirst half of the quarter almost exclusively for Asia and Europe and the second half almost exclusively for\nNorth America, and then actually even that is subdivided depending upon whether it's West Coast or East\nCoast, then we could deliver more cars. But we think it is important to unwind this wave because it ends\nup being sort of optimizing for 1 quarter, but really adding a lot of cost and difficulty and not just -- not\nbeing a good experience for customers and putting great stress on the Tesla team. So if we were to fully\noptimize for profitability in Q2, I think we could do it, but then we would be unable to unwind this crazy\nwave of deliveries. And it also helps on working capital within the quarter to not have the wave. And then,\nZach, do you want to talk about some of the other items?\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. No, I think you summarized it well, Elon. Two other things that I would add. One is that we did make\npricing adjustments to our products in Q1, which puts pressure on margins. And so that's part of what we\nwill see in Q2. The teams are working extremely hard and making terrific progress on improving the cost\nefficiency of the business without sacrificing growth. And that, in combination with the efficiencies from\nunwinding the wave, is where we feel we'll be comfortable returning to a place of profitability in Q3 once\nall of those pieces are in place."

        "paragraph6": "Our next question is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nFirst question, Elon. A couple of days ago, I asked you how safe is the Autopilot technology and you said\nsomething like twice as safe as normal driving. But you seem to be in a really unique position to really\ncollect exabytes of data and that you can't potentially be externally validated much more rigorously\nprovided to a regulatory body or insurance institute to just show how much safer Autopilot is. When can\nwe -- could we expect to see Tesla do that, that type of validation that investors could also get a sense of.\nIt seems really, really important for adoption. And I have a follow-up.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nI think we're just going to continue to report the absolute numbers. So I think reporting in detail just\ngives those who are opposed to Tesla, they can sort of like data mine the situation and then try to turn\na positive into a negative. So we're just going to keep reporting what we report. We do give some more\ndetailed information to insurance companies and to help with rates. And obviously, as we launch our own\ninsurance product next month, we will certainly incorporate that information into the insurance rates.\nSo we can -- because we essentially have a substantial price sort of arbitrage -- or information arbitrage\nopportunity where we have direct knowledge of the risk profile of customers and basically the car. And\nthen if they want to buy Tesla insurance, they'd have to agree to not drive the car in a crazy way. Or they\ncan, but then their insurance rates are higher. So we're just going to keep reporting the numbers at a\nbroad brush-stroke level, which I think is really what matters. Autopilot...\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nOkay. I understand it.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nThat's for safety.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionTESLA, INC.

And just a follow-up, Elon, and you kind of alluded to it a little bit. There's just so much drama\naround Tesla's share price and quarterly results. From the outside, at least, it just looks like a huge\ndistraction. And at the same time, there's so much alternative capital and large amounts of strategic\ncapital that is incrementally deployed in domains where Tesla has real leadership. So how important is it\nfor Tesla to be a publicly traded company, Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nWell, this may -- I don't want to surprise you, but I would prefer we were private. But unfortunately, I\nthink that ship has sailed. So...\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nBut is it important? I mean, do you think the company's value is maximized being public? Or is there just\nonly so much you can do and you just got to play the hand that you're dealt?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nWell, being public does feel like the sort of price of the stock is being set in kind of a manic depressive\nway. And I think Warren Buffett's analogy is just like perhaps being a publicly traded company is like\nhaving someone stand at the edge of your home and just randomly yell different prices for your house\nevery day. It's still the same house. So it's a little bit of a distraction at times, but I'm not sure what to do\nabout it."

Any thoughts there would be helpful.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nNo, there really do seem to be different market segments. Yes.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nAnd also, about only 3.5% of our trade-ins for Model 3 are coming from Model S.

        "paragraph8": "Our next question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research.\nDaniel V. Galves\nWolfe Research, LLC\nI got a couple of questions. One, you mentioned a $50,000 ASP for North America Model 3s. Can you give\nus a little bit more detail on kind of -- is that a number like since the February 28 price adjustments? Is\nthat what you're kind of seeing as order flow? I'm sorry, is ASP is in kind of the current order flow since\nthose price adjustments?\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, this is Zach. I mean, what we saw on February 28 when we launched the Standard Range, the\nStandard Range Plus variance is that there's pent-up demand for those products that released very quickly\nafter it was announced. And then as more time has passed and order rates have stabilized, it's starting --\nthe average ASP has actually been increasing each week ever since as the order rate stabilizes. And just\nunder $50,000 ASP represents the most recent data, and we think it's starting to stabilize there. And we'll\nsee where things trend in EMEA and China as well, but what we're seeing in North America is that over\n50% of our orders are of the long-range variants and the ASPs are profitable enough.\nDaniel V. Galves\nWolfe Research, LLC\nThat's really helpful. And the follow-up is, I know order questions have been asked before, but let me\nput it this way. So the -- I imagine that S and X orders need to have a couple of days to pick up after\nthe upgrades. But on Model 3, whatever your assumption is within the 90,000 to 100,000 Q2 deliveries,\nwhatever that assumption is for Model 3, does your current order flow support that? Or do you need\nsomething kind of positive to happen over the course of the quarter to get there?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nI think we'll -- I think it'll be fine. Yes, I don't think that there's any major thing required."

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nElon, I was wondering if you could talk about this whole notion of raising capital. For about the last year,\nyou sort of eschewed it as almost an evil thing, and I think a lot of investors believe that the company\nmight be better served in its growth aspirations if it did raise capital or had a stronger cash base. And\ngiven that you used up about $2 billion worth of cash in the quarter, aren't you potentially trying to go\nthrough a very thin space while trying to grow quickly and be self-funding, which, quite frankly, may be\nunrealistic? So why not raise capital? And why do you view that as something that Tesla shouldn't do or\nwouldn't do? And I have a follow-up, please.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes. I don't think raising capital should be a substitute for making the company operate more effectively.\nSo that in that sense, I think it's just -- it's important to have a strong financial discipline of the company\nand just -- to make sure we don't have extraneous expenses and that we're just being frugal with capital.TESLA, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL  APR 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 16If we just keep raising capital every time, then it just takes -- we don't have the forcing function for\nimproving the fundamental operation of the business. So I think it is healthy to be on a Spartan diet for\na while. At this point, I do think there are -- is some merit to raising capital. That's a -- but this is sort of\nprobably about the right timing, but yes.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nSo does that mean that investors should expect the capital raise in the near to medium term? And I\nhear you on the force and constraint, but I mean, growth does eat cash, especially in a capital-intensive\nbusiness. And if you really do believe you have a first-mover advantage, why wouldn't you want to push it\nas quickly as possible even if it meant raising capital in the short term.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes. First of all, I'll just say I don't think that capital has been a constraint on our growth thus far. And if\nI thought there was a fundamental constraint on growth we would have [ faced ] capital before now. But\nI think it is very important as company scales to make sure we are on a solid foundation and that we're\n-- we have the appropriate financial discipline throughout the company and are spending money very\nefficiently. At this point, I think we are doing that, but there's more work to do. And Tesla today is a far\nmore efficiently operating organization than it was a year ago. We've made dramatic improvements across\nthe board. And so I think there's merit to the idea of raising capital at this point.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nJust to add to that, the journey we've been on for the last 12 to 18 months on being more efficient in how\nwe spend money has really changed the culture inside the company. It enabled us to accelerate a number\nof cost reductions on the COGS side of our products and then make improvements in operating expenses\nas well. And then as we look forward to capital investments for Giga Shanghai and Model Y and ultimately\na European facility, our CapEx per unit of capacity has come down significantly through the work from the\nteam here. So I think it has been a very productive journey for us.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nAnd technically, we did raise some debt capital in China for the Shanghai Giga on the order of $500\nmillion. So that -- we want to make sure that we don't have to draw upon global capital to fund the\nShanghai factory."

Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nNo, they would actually receive their cars sooner. It just means that instead of building cars in batches,\nwhere, say, the first half of the quarter is just dedicated to China, Europe cars, and the second half is\ndedicated to North American cars, that we blend vehicle production for customers throughout the world,TESLA, INC. FQ1 2019 EARNINGS CALL  APR 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 17throughout the quarter. And then this puts much less strain on us. We don't want a situation again like\nwhat we had like in Q1 where essentially all the cars were arriving at customers worldwide at the same\ntime. We literally delivered half of the entire quarter's deliveries were in the final 10 days of Q1. That's\ninsane. So I think we need to unwind that. It's also just not a great customer experience because we're\nshorthanded and then we have to redeploy like people from -- like that are working in sales, HR, legal,\nengineering, everyone, just to deliver cars. And then we -- then they can't do their regular jobs. So it just\nmakes sense to just blend the production according to demand throughout the quarter.\nAlexander Eugene Potter\nPiper Jaffray Companies, Research Division\nOkay. That makes sense. And second question, I guess on go-to-market, there was some period of time\nthere where the company was focused on closing storefronts, a fair amount of noise made around that.\nAnd then it looked like some of the commentary was hedging that strategy. I was just wondering if there's\nany update there. And if you have one, that would be helpful.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nSure. I think Tesla just sort of -- specifically, I didn't handle messaging of that well. The -- I mean, that's\namplified by the statement -- we make a statement, it's sort of taken to an extreme when there's a\nmisunderstanding. We certainly will continue to have stores, and we will continue to add stores provided\nthey are in locations where there is high foot traffic and for people that are in our target market. So we\nactually will continue to add stores in locations that are no-brainers. We will close stores in locations where\nthey are incredibly hard to find and the foot traffic of potential buyers is very low such that it does not\nsupport the cost of the store and the people in it. So I think it's just common sense. And then all sales\nonline just means that even if you go into a store, you -- we would guide you to order the car on your\nphone. The store is essentially like -- they're like information centers, a place you can get a test drive and\nbuy some Tesla merchandise, that kind of thing. But all sales online doesn't mean all stores are closed. It\njust means that when you buy a car, you always do it on your phone in the store or at home or anywhere.\nYou also -- all orders online doesn't meant all stores are closing. That's not what is meant."

So\nwe must abide by that.\nPhilippe Jean Houchois\nJefferies LLC, Research Division\nAll right. And can I ask you a question of coming back to what Adam was saying about the drama that\nsurrounds your stock, unfortunately. Why don't you reduce some of it by disclosing on a monthly basis\nyour deliveries and also maybe disclosing early your greenhouse revenue instead of just reserves, so we\nget right away a better view on some of these details that kind of move the stock?\nElon R.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 18I think that would actually be counterproductive because people read too much into what occurred in\na month. I mean, even at a quarterly basis, things can be lumpy. And so the more granularity that's\nprovided, let's say, on a monthly level, the people would reach all sorts of conclusions that don't make\nsense. It's like -- literally like sales to a particular country, say overseas, are affected by when the ship\narrives. And so if the ship arrives on the 31st of the month or the first of the next month, this will make\nit look like something dramatic has happened. But actually the ship was just a day late. So people read --\nthat would increase the drama, not decrease it.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd we're filling the ship 100%...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nFilling the ship 100%. So it's like it just ends up being lumpy. So like if you managed -- if you've\ncalculated like GDP of a country to offset the U.S., GDP on Sunday is extremely low, but GDP on a Monday\nis extremely high. It does not mean -- nothing has really changed."

Is that over the mid-term? Or is that something you expect to hit by the end of this year? And if\nso, what gets S and X back higher given the price cuts?\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, this is Zach here. That guidance that we're targeting for the end of the year. Although internally,\nwe're working towards S and X non-GAAP gross margin achieving that sooner. The biggest lever there is\nactually 2 components. One is, as we increase volume back on our S and X production line, there's just a\nnatural benefit there from the fixed cost absorption which will help us. But we also have a number of cost\nreduction projects in place that we're executing on over the course of the year. And then the third piece\nwhich applies to S and X, but also Model 3, we're seeing an increased take rate on our full self-driving\noffering. And there are revenue deferrals associated with that given that the full suite of functionality\nis not there. And as that option becomes -- approaches sees us continually roll out more, we will be\nable to have more revenue on that. And so all of these things together within our internal plans gives us\nconfidence.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes, we should -- I should mention that the upgraded powertrain for S and X was actually results in a\nsignificant cost down because we essentially took the high volume rear-drive units of the Model 3, which\nis extremely efficient but [ the same magnet motor and power ] electronics already in it and we made\na version for that -- of that for the front-drive unit of S and X. And so we're actually able to get a cost\nreduction while improving range and performance of the car. That's just one example.\nJoseph Robert Spak\nRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And the second question is just looking at the 10-K, you've continually noticed $4.9 billion\npurchase obligation, which I think is primarily related to Panasonic Giga 1. And then Elon, in some of\nyour communication, you've indicated production constraints. So I guess the question is, does that $4.9\nbillion correlate to reaching that 35-gigawatt hour rate?

        "paragraph15": "Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nI mean, it sounds like from the tone of the call that you don't see that there's a demand issue for some of\nthe product, but margins seem to be under pressure and typically automakers stop pricing when there is a\ndemand issue. So what is the logic of the price cuts during the quarter?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nI mean, our goal, as we've been very clear about from beginning of the company, is to make our cars\nas affordable as possible. And we thought it was important to offer the $35,000 Model 3 and then to\ncreate a sort of bundled package for the Model 3 with the increased range because we think actually that\ndifference between 220 and 240 is quite important, the more point people realize in range and having a\nposher premium interior and then finally, Autopilot. So we thought those -- [ like we went and paired like ]\nproduct that's really just nailed the sweet spot, which I think the $39,000 -- $39,500 Model 3 is just really\nnailed the sweet spot and we're seeing consumer response accordingly. People can still buy the $35,000\nversion of the Model 3 that, of course, didn't have Autopilot and has a software range restriction, that kind\nof thing. It's like slightly more inconvenient to buy. You just have to make a phone call or visit a store.\nSo it's just not like you have to complete the obstacle course or something. But we see very few people\nactually taking us up on that $35,000 offer, but it is there and will remain there.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nAnd as a follow-up, you're still targeting the China facility ramp by the end of the year. Are you still\nconfident in the 3,000 per week? And do you have a battery supplier yet that's getting pretty close to that\npoint?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect\nYes, the Shanghai Gigafactory progress is going incredibly well, a testament to the outstanding execution\nof our team on the ground there. I get daily e-mails with Tesla pictures from one day to the next from\n[ Tong Zhu ], who leads the Gigafactory program. And so we're obviously discussing it or getting updates,\nso 7 days a week so the -- in that Gigafactory e-mail. So in terms of execution, it's outstanding but, of\ncourse, the production goes as fast as the slowest item. That's very important to bear in mind. So we have\n99% of things in good shape, but 1% is missing is what can make a car. So with respect to -- that said,\nit looks like we'll reach volume production at the end of this year with, let's say, more than 1,000 cars a\nweek, maybe 2,000 from Shanghai Giga at the end of this year. That's what it looks like to be a case right\nnow. If it's not at the end, it will be shortly thereafter.
