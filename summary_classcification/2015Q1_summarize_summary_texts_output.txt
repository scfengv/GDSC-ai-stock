"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We expect to see a significant ramp in Q4 for the X and have something that may be as much as 2x other quarters. There are huge advanced orders for the Model X, and we see a steady climb in demand for the S. The development took a lot longer than we originally anticipated."
"summary_text": "The amount of credits, ZEV credits, we earn depends on the size of the pack, different for what we're doing for the 60 versus 85, and now the new ones at 70. We have hundreds vehicles in the battery swap pilot program. We've just found like it's -- there just is not a lot of interest in people doing pack swap. The response to the power wall has been overwhelming."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We'll see demand for stationary storage as measured in sort of megawatt hours or gigawatts hours to be approximately double that of the car. That's our best guess for long-term demand yet. The high-energy pack is more like around the -- maybe depending on how it's used, anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 cycles. And the daily cycler one, I mean, we're expected to be able to daily cycle for something on the order of 15 years."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We're confident what we're using is going to be the best. But if there's something better, we can also adjust and change over time. Jeffrey B. Straubel: I think there's also a substantial benefit to the sort of track record of the Tesla fleet."

Also related to this business, it seems like you're using third parties for most of the distributing, installation. If you achieved maybe a 20% gross margin, can you pass along any thoughts on how we should we be thinking in terms of SG&A is allocated?"
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: It is tricky, as companies grow, to maintain a consistent culture. I think we're doing okay.Jeffrey B. Straubel: Having a general mix of people that have been here for a very long time and have seen the company when it was even much smaller."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I think we're past almost sort of answering super-detailed questions about the X ramp. We want to make sure we really are delivering a product that has been thoroughly validated in hot and cold weather and through millions of miles of travel. Apple has kind of still, undocumented, been making inroads into building up its vehicle engineering and transportation capabilities."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: All we know right now is like we have demand, like, well in excess of our production ramp. We think ultimately, we think things will get there, it could take a long time, but that's kind of where we Think things will end up."
"summary_text": "We do expect to be free cash flow positive in Q4, that doesn't change. And as we go along, clearly, we areoptimizing for efficiency, which results in increase of our finished goods inventory. So we'll take those actions to make sure we have a solid balance sheet. Elon Musk: I think it's -- yes, I think things are looking pretty good for Q4."

"summary_text": "I was a little surprised by the sequential drop in ZEV gross margins. I think you guys had obviously very good gross margins this quarter relative to some of the headwinds that you were facing. And I guess I was surprised to see that x ZEV, they go from 26 to 25."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: A big factor is labor hours per vehicle. That has steadily improved. We've made good progress on that in Q1, we'll continue to make good progress through the rest of the year. We're focused across every line item of our COGS, so material cost reductions, freight."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: Probably 3 months from now -- no, actually, I'm sorry. We're in May, so it's like -- this is probably July. And it will be very similar to the S, like, it's not going toTESLA, INC. FQ1 2015 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06, 2015."
