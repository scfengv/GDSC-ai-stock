"summary_text": "Tesla Motors, Inc. Third Quarter 2015 FinancialResults Q&A Conference Call. The conference call is being webcast on Tesla's website at http://www.telsa.com/investor-relations/tlsa-financial-results-Q&A-conference-call."
"summary_text": "The conference is being recorded. Jeff Evanson, Head of Investor Relations, will host the call. Elon Musk, Tesla's Chairman and CEO; J.B. Straubel, our CTO; and Deepak Ahuja, the company's CFO, will be on the line."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We see no fundamental issues on the production ramp. It's just a question of how quickly we can solve each issue. We feel very confident at being able to get to several hundred vehicles per week by the end of the year. The -- with respect to stationary storage, I mean, the -- that is, again, sort of a production limited thing."
"summary_text": "Most people who ordered the car actually ordered with the Autopilot convenience features. The convenience features like Autosteer are $2,500, but like most people have actually -- had actually already ordered that. Those that hadn't -- haven't ordered it can actually turn it on for -- it's actually slightly more if you get it after."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: There's a right time to make announcements, and this is not that time. On Autopilot, can you share any early data you might have collected with us post the automated driving software update? How many miles have been driven with Autop autopilot engaged? And how many accidents prevented?"
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: There's been some fairly crazy videos on YouTube. We are -- this is not good. And we will be putting some additional constraints on when Autopilot can beactivated to minimize the possibility of people doing crazy things with it. We're looking forward to hearing from you."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We try to be proactive, so if we -- without -- well before we're sort of forced to do a recall, we proactively try to fix things in the cars that we think might, in the future, be issue. 97% of respondents said that their next car would be a Tesla. Frankly, this is the only question people should care about."
"summary_text": "Jeffrey B. Straubel: We definitely read the report and we're not terribly concerned about it. I mean, we are constantly agonizing about cell costs and pack costs. And we don't think anyone is on a path to be even close to us. If they are, I would be the first tocongratulate them."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We don't see any fundamental obstacle to achieving a production rate of several hundred per week sometime next month. We -- I think it's likely that we can be in that 1,600 to 1,800 range -- per week range in Q1. I mean, I'm guessing, we'll probably be towards the lower end of that range."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We have substantially in-sourced the seats at this point. The big variables are what -- technically, in which week do we -- are we able to really spool up Model X production? And a few weeks movement, one way or the other, has quite a big impact on Model Xproduction. And then of course, we still have to get those cars delivered."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: Right now, we're actually very, very happy with the quality of the drive units. We want drive units that just never wear out. That's our goal. So driving that's going out now are -- and for the last several months, have been excellent."
"summary_text": "A year ago, you guys had been targeting 28% to 30% gross margins by around this time. So what's the right way to think about gross margin over the next 18 months? Well, we -- our goal is to steadily improve gross margin, and hopefully exceed 30% on the S and X line."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: It's not as big a leap as it might seem from Q4 to Q3 because there's a whole weak missing from Q3. It's worth noting that 2015 -- in 2010, Tesla was delivering 500 cars per year. We now deliver 500 cars in just over 2 days."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We expect the similarly equipped Model X to be no more than $5,000 greater than the price of a Model S. He said that deliveries for the Model X initially are clearly a function of how many you can build, given your large backlog of orders."
"summary_text": "Our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Colin, can you talk a little bit about the acceleration in the ramp of the Gigafactory? And when do you think, we might see cells coming out of the factory and into cars? And then, just in terms of the dynamics around leasing, are you seeing any real meaningful changes in overall lease take rates?"
"summary_text": "The next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian, what's going to be different in terms of hitting that ramp-up on deliveries for Model S in 4Q vis-\u00e0-vis drawing down that inventory? And to clarify just the Model X pricing, is that based on range and features? Or is it just based onBattery size, the $5,000 difference?"
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I think we're still aiming to have Model 3 in about 2 years. So but I think the cadence of future products should improve, as we have more resources to shorten the critical path on things that, like I was describing earlier, like stamping tools and molding dies."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I think, in the long term, there's probably close to $100,000 a year -- sorry, 100,000 vehicles a year of S demand. And maybe something comparable to -- for X, holding economic conditions constant and assuming full market maturation, which could take like quite a long time in some markets. And then, on the margins on the X volume, I think they're going to be comparable."
