But first of all, I'd like to announce that our CFO, Jason Wheeler, has decided to leave Tesla\nin April -- so it's at end of next month, to pursue opportunities in public policy. Jason will be replaced\nby Deepak Ahuja, who was Tesla's first CFO and worked for the company for more than 7 years before\nstepping away in 2015. Deepak will formally take over as CFO in early March and with Jason remaining at\nTesla through April to entrust a smooth transition. And let's see, Jason, would you like to say anything?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. First, Elon, thanks for the opportunity.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nThank you.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nIt's been a great ride, and I'm really going to miss working with all the wonderful people at Tesla. This is\nan A team. And when I walked in the door, I was very passionate about the mission of the company. And\ntoday, I'm even more passionate than I was than the day I walked in. And I think it's also important to\nsay that I'm looking to scratch an itch that I've have had for many, many years now. I'm going to go do\nsomething in the public sector, but I wouldn't have felt comfortable about leaving if we didn't have a really\ngood plug-and-play solution in place for the company. And I think with Deepak's history here on the verge\nof bankruptcy and everything he's gone through, he's well positioned...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIt's been [ph] a long time ago.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ4 2016 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 22, 2017\nLong time ago, long, long time ago. He's well positioned to take you to the next level of growth. And I've\nspent a good amount of time with him in the past week, and he's super-energized and ready to go. He's a\ngreat leader, and I think I'll leave Tesla in good hands.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nAll right. So thanks -- and Jason, thank you again for everything you've done.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nAbsolutely, my pleasure.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nSo let's see. I think the -- yes.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nWell, I think we're ready for the first question.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. That's just right. Do you have any question?\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nAll right. Vicky, first question, please.TESLA, INC.

        "paragraph4": "And our first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nFirst, good luck, Jason; and congrats, Deepak. Welcome back. So Elon, a question for you on Mars. Let's\nkick it off at Mars, okay?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nReally?\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nYes. It has Tesla relevance. So just bear with me.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI admire long-term thinking but impressive.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nWell, numerous reports have suggested the new administration may be in favor of accelerating a mission\nto send humans to Mars. I'm curious if you think this is accurate in spirit. And if launched, how could this\npotentially change your balance of time spent between Tesla and SpaceX? Could it potentially change the\nrationale of keeping Tesla and SpaceX as independent companies? And this is a serious question, Elon.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nOkay. Well, yes, but when you started out, I was a little curious as to how this would become relevant to\nTesla. But as I said before, I expect to remain with Tesla essentially forever unless somebody kicks me\nout. So that remains my intention. And I've been pursuing the sort of Mars thing at SpaceX and the same\nenergy at Tesla for a long time simultaneously. So I think it's going through a pretty good rhythm. And\nyes, I'm -- I don't think -- I certainly don't think I'm going to change my actions as a result of an initiative\nby the administration although I think a Mars initiative would be amazing and really energize the public\ndomestically and would apply just as the Apollo mission to the moon that was half a century ago. So that's\n-- yes, that's I think probably the best I -- the most I can say at the -- yes [indiscernible] yes.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nJust a follow-up on insurance. If your cars prove to be as much as 90% safer than other cars on a per mile\nbasis, as I think you've alluded that -- it's a reasonable target medium term, and if insurance companies\nonly offer your customers, say, like a piddling 5% discount versus a comparably priced car, would you\nconsider offering a service or product like P&C insurance directly to Tesla owners from your own platform\nand your own stores?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nJon, do you want to take that?TESLA, INC. FQ4 2016 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 22, 2017\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nHey, Adam, it's Jon. We're actually currently doing that, and we've been doing it quietly. But in Asia\nin particular where we started this, now the majority of Tesla cars are sold with an insurance product\nthat is customized to Tesla. It takes into account not only these Autopilot safety features but also the\nmaintenance cost of the car. So it's our vision in the future that we'll be able to offer a single price for the\ncar maintenance and insurance in a really compelling offering for the consumer, and we're currently doing\nthat today.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. And this is not to the exclusion of insurance providers, but I mean, if we find that the insurance\nproviders are not matching the insurance proportion of the risk of the car, then if we need to, we will in-\nsource it. But I think we'll find that insurance providers do address the insurance cost proportionate to the\nrisk of a Tesla.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nThat's true. That's true. We're doing this with insurance partners today.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nRight."

        "paragraph5": "And our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nCurious as to what has changed on your end. Obviously, you've got -- made an acquisition. You've hired\nthe individual in manufacturing from last year. But really moving from the Model S and X to the Model 3\nramp that you're looking for in the back half of 2017 here into 2018, how have you gone about the Model\n3 development differently versus the Model S and Model X that will really be able to unlock the key to\ndriving production much higher than what your previous ramps have looked like for new products?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nRight, the Model 3 is designed -- is really designed for manufacturing. It's considerably a simpler car\nthan the S or the X. Some of these -- some modifications are obvious. For example, the Model 3 only\nhas one screen, whereas the S and X have 2 screens and 2 separate computers powering each screen.\nThe Model 3 has 1.5 kilometers of wiring. The Model S has 3 kilometers of wiring. So we simplified the\nwiring system considerably. The -- a lot of the bells and whistles that are present on an S and an X are not\npresent on a Model 3. So we don't have self-presenting door handles, for example, or falcon wing doors.\nThese reduce the risk substantially in a ramp and make it just easier to scale. And so I think it's going\nto be a very compelling car, but it's just -- it's a simpler design. And we also understand manufacturing\na lot better than we did in the past. And we're also able to get usually the A team at the A supplier for\nModel 3. It's really that we're now able to get that, whereas for S and -- particularly for S and to some\ndegree for X -- when we trying to get suppliers for Model S, a lot of the top-tier suppliers wouldn't even\nwork with us, didn't believe the car, that the -- they thought we'd go bankrupt. And the -- IHS, I think\nit's called, but they're basically a predictor for -- volume of the Model S predicted -- an official prediction\nof 3,000 units lifetime for the Model S. And for a lot of the big supplier, particularly the large sort of\nconglomerate suppliers, they just plug that number into their predictions but they ignore what we say.\nAnd then basically, the volume is either too small to count or the car cost is enormous because these fixedTESLA, INC. FQ4 2016 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 22, 2017\ncosts must be allocated over such a small volume. Now in fact, we are building something in the order of\n50,000 Model Ss per year. And so having shown the results of the S and the X, the interest from suppliers,\nyou went from basically getting like the worst team on second-tier suppliers to getting the best team on\nfirst-tier suppliers, really a big difference.\nDavid J. Tamberrino\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nYes, okay. And then just following up on that as I think about reduced complexity of the vehicle,\nunderstood. From an actual line speed manufacturing perspective for the Model 3, what are you doing\ndifferently with the manufacturing process that is going to allow you to drive that ramp in production?\nSo think about 50,000 units, Model S, on an annual basis, it's good. It's great. You've been making that\nvehicle for the last 3, 4 years.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nRight, as opposed to -- I mean, for -- yes, an annualized rate of 250,000. 5x that number for Model 3 is a\nreasonable question to ask. The -- there's just a lot more automation than there is for S and X. We have\nthe Gigafactory, of course. That's a huge asset for factory, powertrain, power electronics, chargers and a\nfew other things. So that's a huge asset and yes -- so -- but also we focused most of Tesla engineering,\nincluding design engineering, into designing the factory. The -- I think in the future, the factory will\nbe a more important product than the car itself. I've said this before but we're -- our goal is to be the\nbest manufacturer on earth. This is a real goal. I don't know if we'll succeed, but I think we're making\ngood progress in that direction. And that's -- yes, it's really -- when you think of the factory, it's just an\nenormous product with at least [indiscernible] more complex than whatever it makes. J.B., anything you\nwant to add?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes, I might just add that we really learned a lot of lessons, especially from the difficult Model X ramp.\nThat's something that's in our recent memory, and we fought through it and succeeded. But I think in\nthe design of the Model 3 and the system and the lines that produce it, many of those learnings have\nbeen incorporated from the beginning. So the amount of complexity in the operations to assemble the car\nis dramatically reduced. The amount of operations involved some level of sort of assembly craft, where\nthere's more judgment of the operator. It's dramatically reduced, almost eliminated. And a lot of these\nthings that we could identify directly as the bottlenecks that hurt us on the X ramp, we've been able to\ntarget specifically and reduce or eliminate. So that has -- though painful, it was a very helpful experience\nfor us to get ready for Model 3.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. Now I do want to emphasize with production ramps in general that -- they call it an S curve. So the\nrate of production is as fast as the slowest component in the vehicle. And when you have several thousand\nunique items, the -- it can be as fast as the least likely and worst executing part of Tesla or our suppliers,\nbut that's just the way it goes. So it's -- you're going through a series of constraints. You try to anticipate\nas many as possible. There are new issues that pop up every week. And then we attack them and get\nthem to solve for schedule. And then another issue will pop up in the following week. So it's schedule\nwhack-a-mole. And if we knew what would be late now, we would obviously attack it, but some of these\nthings only come to light late in the game. And when you have a global supply chain, you inherit a lot of\nforce majeure risk from around the world. It's just one of the things that I think we want to do is minimize\nforce majeure risk. This is -- if you inherit like every force majeure risk on the earth, then of course,\nthings are going to go wrong because earth is big. So I think we're going to, increasingly over time,\nrationalize our supply chain to minimize the force majeure risk. It's very important, but yes, the -- it's\nalways tricky being a public company and reporting on a quarterly basis. Even small differences in where\nthat exponential part of the S curve is can make quite a big impact on the quarter because [indiscernible]TESLA, INC. FQ4 2016 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 22, 2017\nimagine datelines moving around an exponential curve. Just small changes here and there have quite a\nbig effect. And then things get more predictable as you get to the flat part of the S curve, the top of the S\ncurve. That's why it's a lot easier to predict, to say what things would be next year or the end of this year\nas opposed to what they'd be month by month this year."

        "paragraph6": "And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.\nRyan J. Brinkman\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nJust regarding the explanation in the shareholder letter that you experienced little Autopilot revenue,\nlittle new revenue in 4Q. Can you talk about what delayed the software updates into 1Q? Was it a switch\nfrom Mobileye in any way? And then talk about how the current capabilities of Autopilot in 1Q in terms of\nperformance and safety, how that's better than maybe what was offered previously.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, we had some challenges in the transition from Mobileye to Tesla software running on GPU. The --\nour original plan was to have a migration strategy where we have Mobileye and our -- and Tesla vision\noperating at the same time to have some kind of a smooth process, but Mobileye did not -- refused to\ndo that. So that forced us to reach in [ph] the board and caused unexpected delays, where we had to\nbasically delete that chip from the board and just [indiscernible] on Tesla vision. Safety is always our\nprimary concern. So we could have released Tesla vision [indiscernible] orders there at high speed.\nProbably 3 months ago -- I was driving at a high speed personally 3 months ago but -- so I think we want\nto just have an exhaustive testing process, a vetting [ph] process before enabling that throughout the\nfleet. So we've been edging our way up gradually now. Longitudinal control, [indiscernible] cruise control\nis at 80 miles an hour and [indiscernible] at 50 miles an hour. And I think we should be able to get both\n[indiscernible] Unless testing shows something different, we should able to get them both to around the --\nmaybe 85 miles an hour next month and be at parity with [indiscernible]. But that's -- and then obviously,\nthings will only improve from there.\nRyan J. Brinkman\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nJust last question on the $500 million cash generation outlook, including growth of nonrecourse debt, how\nmuch of that relates to the automotive operations versus SolarCity? Or maybe you probably don't want\nto break it out that way. Just how are you thinking about the contribution from, like, tax equity funding\nversus maybe, call it, combined like Tesla-SolarCity, like, ongoing operations?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSure, yes. So this is Jason. So that commitment that we made when we closed the deal was on the Solar\nside. So that's what the $500 million really [indiscernible]. And that's going to come from a number of\nfactors. One of the things we're already starting to see great traction on is a shift away from leasing\nsystems to doing loans and cash sales of systems. We provided some information in the letter about that.\nThat's going well. We've also done that on the vehicle side. It's worth noting. And then the other thing is\nas part of the acquisition, we committed to $150 million in synergies. And some of that cash generation is\nobviously going to come from going after those synergies, and we're on track to really hit that. We've got\nlots of opportunities on customer acquisition cost. Tesla has a very strong global brand. We've got a great\nretail footprint. So we've got good pieces in place to really drive customer acquisition cost down. And then\nobviously on the manufacturing side as well, we're really thinking through what that's going to do for us\nand how we can drive cost savings there as well."

        "paragraph7": "And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.TESLA, INC. FQ4 2016 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 22, 2017\nJoseph Robert Spak\nRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nFirst question, I guess, relates to the delivery guidance which I know you limited to the first half. But\nas we think about the full year and the back half, is the -- and the launch of the Model 3, is there the\npotential for disruption to S and X? Is that also one of the factors why you're sort of -- decided to sort of\nguide the way you did?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nAll right.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. I think the way we're thinking about that is there's going to be pretty higher bars on -- with\nthe deliveries only for Model 3 in the second half of the year. And I think Elon described that well when\nhe talked about the S curve. So we didn't want to muddy our guidance by doing some kind of a combined\nnumber for the year. And obviously, execution on X and S and execution on getting ready for Model 3 in\nthe first half is what's important. And those are the things that we really want to point investors to and\nhow we're measuring ourselves.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIt's sort of -- tackling the area under the curve is tricky when you're in an exponential. And it always\nstarts out tiny and then it goes up -- well, it goes exponentially. So -- but generally, people have trouble\nwrapping their minds around an exponential. The natural tendency is to extrapolate on a straight line. And\nso the -- it's just [indiscernible] important to emphasize that this is -- this blow up is exponential. It does\nget into a linear zone, and then it goes into a log curve. So...\nJoseph Robert Spak\nRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nAnd then will -- I guess just to follow on that, I was wondering if you guys would be willing to indicate\nwhen you think configuration for the 3 would open. But separately also, Elon, there's been a lot of news\nor noise around unionization at Fremont, and I was wondering if you guys could give a little bit of color on\nyour views of potentially unionization. And if it did occur, sort of how that changes the cost structure?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nSure. Well, there is obviously quite a strong effort by UAW to unionize Tesla. And actually, a lot of people\nat Tesla have been approached by UAW. They've expressed concerns about this. I -- and there were some\nnumber of claims made by someone who I think is de facto an employee of UAW but at Tesla. And there's\na piece that's probably going to be published in the next day or two, because I wanted to make sure I fully\ninvestigated the claims before writing a thought piece. But that [indiscernible] matters over the last few\nmonths. Tesla's injury rate is less than half of the industry average contrary to the allegations made. And\nthe compensation, if you look at -- if you started 4 years ago, the vesting period for Tesla stock is 4 years.\nSo if you said, \"What is the outcome for somebody who started 4 years ago?\" It's by far the highest in\nthe auto industry. The -- there was an allegation that a few are underpaid at Tesla, but in fact, they're the\nhighest paid in the industry if you include the equity, which obviously you should include. So the -- there\nare really only disadvantages for someone to say that -- to want the UAW here. I mean, the track record is\nworse in every other company. I don't think this is likely to occur."

        "paragraph8": "And our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.\nAileen SmithTESLA, INC. FQ4 2016 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 22, 2017\nThis is Aileen Smith on for John. First in a more high-level question, I realize it's still very early days in\nterms of the new Trump administration, but with Scott Pruitt now head of the EPA, are you anticipating\nany changes with respect to the oversight or regulations under CARB and its relationship to the EPA? Elon,\nis that coming up in your meetings with the Trump team at all or any of the discussions? And how would\nyou respond in the event that regulations and standards or the potential to generate the credits were to be\naltered?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nSure. Well, it's only come up briefly. And my response is that I think it will be fine to get rid of incentives\nand subsidies, but that should be uniformly applied to all industries. It would obviously be wrong to\n-- or to get rid of any sort of government intervention in sustainable energy while retaining it in fossil\nfuels. That -- if the principle is to get rid of government intervention, that should be uniformly applied,\nnot unfairly applied. But that's the only thing -- there was no -- that was my comment, but there's no\nresponse given. They listened to that and that's sort of -- that's how I feel. And as I mentioned on a\nprior call, the reality actually is that if electric vehicle incentives went away tomorrow, Tesla's competitive\nposition would improve. It's probably why GM is able to sell the Volt at the price that they are able to do\nit while on paper, making a loss. It's that they -- their ZEV credits are worth only twice as much as they\nare for Tesla because they get the full retail value of their credits, which is worth about $10,000 more to\nthem than it is to Tesla. We get basically 50 cents on the dollar when we can sell ZEV credits, which is\nnot always. Last quarter, we were able to sell only a tiny amount of ZEV credits because that mandate is\njust already really weak. So the irony of getting rid of it would actually improve our competitive position.\nAnd ZEV credits only apply to 14 states in the U.S., every 14 -- they don't apply internationally. And yes,\nso -- and then things like the federal tax credit for electric vehicle caps out, I think, at 300,000 cars.\nWe're not far from that point. So the ZEV, basically the credits either don't scale to high volume or they're\ndisadvantageous to Tesla. Even in California, which is our home base, California legislature put an income\ncap on any one who could get the California tax credit for EVs, which then excluded a whole bunch of our\ncustomers, which I think is counterproductive to the biggest manufacturing player in California Why the\nhell the legislation? That, I do not know, but it was harmful to the state.\nAileen Smith\nOkay, great. That's helpful. And then sort of a second question. You guys gave some helpful disclosure\nin terms of the vehicle order growth for the Model S and X in the quarter. Can you talk about the order\ngrowth for the Model 3? The last measurement that we received on the size of the wait list or the order\nbook was 400,000 plus or minus. Can you talk about how that's grown over the past few quarters? I\nmean, if we look at the customer deposits on your balance sheet, it actually declined sequentially from 3Q\nto 4Q. So how much, if any, of that is related to the Model 3?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. So it's not related to the Model -- this is Jason. It's not related to the Model 3. We still had\na number of Signature Series Model X reservations, where there was just a higher deposit required for\nthose cars, and we were able to deliver a number of those in Q4. So that's the primary driver behind the\nquarter-over-quarter decrease in the customer deposit decline.\nAileen Smith\nOkay. And can you give any size of the order book for the Model 3 as it stands right now?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nWe're still in great shape.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderTESLA, INC. FQ4 2016 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 22, 2017\nYes. We don't put that number because people read too much into it -- yes, as Jason is saying, that is\nreally not our concern. But yes, we anti-sell the Model 3.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nWe don't want to make the line longer.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, good point."

        "paragraph9": "And our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nCan you -- in the press release, you gave comments on margins for the first half of the year. Any broad\ncolor on how we should think about margins in the second half, particularly as the Model 3 launches? I\nmean, will that be profitable day 1? Or is that going to take some time for that to ramp? Any color there?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nPerhaps that will not be profitable on day 1 because of that exponential issue that I mentioned. The\nonly Model 3s will be like horribly negative margin, particularly on day 1, literally -- as in literally on\nday 1 because just on the -- at a tiny, tiny rate as you go up this giant machine. So it's just -- like no\ncompany on earth could -- there's no point for Tesla. It is like physically impossible. So you have to\nget the production rate to some reasonable capacity percentage of the system. If the capacity of the\nproduction system is X, until you're at least like half X, your gross margin is going to be weak. And it's\ngoing to be terrible when you're like an order of magnitude below -- or if you're 10% of X, like or less, it's\ngoing to be terrible. So -- but then it will get really good as you start to approach nameplate capacity. I\nthink it's great, but -- and then as we get to the initial phase of capacity of 5,000 a week, I would expect\nto see gross margins comparable to that of the S and X.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nSo -- and that's next year that you should get to the 5,000 per week. Is that right?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, I feel pretty confident that we should get there by the end of this year to 5,000 a week. The -- now\nI do want to separate this from parts orders. I know a number of our suppliers are listening. It would\nbe impossible to keep this -- I mean, like nothing is a secret these days, it seems. Yes, it's like major\nintelligence organizations cannot keep a secret. It's like a really -- I mean, who can honestly? So when\nwe place parts orders with our suppliers, we've told them 1,000 a week in July, 2,000 a week in August\nand 4,000 a week in September. These are parts orders and the parts need to arrive, then you can turn\ninto a car and the car needs to be delivered to customers. None of these things occur instantaneously.\nSo -- and we have what I call like maybe the term paper problem of, like -- I was a teaching assistant in\ncollege. And no matter what date we set the exam paper for, when the term paper was due, it's -- there's\nalways like some order of people that are late. It's just the way it goes. People are sometimes -- well, and\nI'm guilty of this, too, like, too optimistic about the timing or they get unlucky or something like that. So\nwe have to set these really strict dates. And some number of people are late, but it only has to be 1%.\nAnd then we'd either have to make those parts manually at great cost or slow down the production rate\nand ramp at great cost. If we make something manually as opposed to mass production, it can be 10x,TESLA, INC. FQ4 2016 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 22, 2017\n20x, 30x more than a product that's made -- handmade as opposed to made with high volume production\nequipment. So that's essentially -- I'm trying to give you what the problem space looks like in my head so\nthat you can try to model it. You know what I know. And if I knew which 1% of suppliers it was right now,\nI would obviously take action. But I don't because I don't know who's going to be unlucky. I don't know\nwho's being overly optimistic. But that's -- the 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, that -- those are the deadlines we set\nup for our suppliers for parts delivery. And parts get made into cars. Cars need to get delivered. And those\nare 3 separate steps.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nOne last -- I just have my last question, just any color on cash burn? And I think last time, you mentioned\nthat you were confident you wouldn't need a capital raise. Do you still feel that way? I mean, I think it was\nclose to $1 billion in the quarter, and it sounds like CapEx is going to rise next year. How should we think\nabout cash burn cadence and the confidence [indiscernible] no capital raise going forward?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell -- so this is really a question of what's the risk tolerance of the company or how close to the edge\nthat we want to go. According to our financial plan, no capital needs to be raised for the Model 3, but we\nget very close to the edge. So then that's probably not the best thing for shareholders on a risk-adjusted\nbasis. So we're considering a number of options, but I think it probably makes sense to raise capital to\nreduce risk.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nColin, I just want to add a couple of points there, too. [indiscernible] on the cash receiving [ph] end, we\nsee $1 billion in cash burn, but I don't think that's fully accurate. We had $522 million in CapEx. So we're\ninvesting at a very healthy rate ahead of what we need to do for Model 3. And then there were certainly\nsome timing differences. We've talked about, in our deliveries press release, we had 2,750 cars that we\nmissed delivering them by a couple of days. So I think there's a little cross-quarter timing going on there\nand it's not indicative of what cash flow from operations is going to look like in the future. Another -- to\ngo -- circle back to your point and one of the questions from earlier about what's different about Model\n3, I thought maybe I'll provide just a little bit more color on costing, and this will help you think a little\nabout margins on a go-forward basis, too. From the very beginning of the Model 3 program, the costing\nof the car was front and center and it's always been a key part of the conversation and the decisions that\nhave been made. And it goes all the way back to principles, as Elon likes to talk about. On a part-by-\npart basis, we've been looking at what is the value of the commodities in that part, what's a reasonable\ncost to fabricate the parts and what's a reasonable margin on top of it. And that's been the starting\npoint for costing for everything that's gone into the Model 3. The other thing that's important -- and we\ntalked about this a lot over the past several quarters, is just being more efficient with our capital spend.\nI mean, J.B. has done a fabulous job with this up at the Gigafactory. I don't know if you had a chance\nto attend the event or not, but the volumetric efficiency there is quite stunning. And if you can do more\nin a smaller footprint, the capital required is less. And the less capital is required to do things, the less\ndepreciation load it's going to be on each unit produced once you get to volume production and deliveries.\n[indiscernible], it's going to be-- that's going to good to add additional color to your comments and your\nquestions.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. That's sort of applying the rocket equation to manufacturing. And it's yes, volume -- essentially, the\nrocket equation technique, it's mass efficiency. But I think volumetric efficiency of the factory, as Jason is\nmentioning, and then -- and X velocity of product from the factory kind of just slow it down pretty much to\nthose just -- those 2 things."

        "paragraph10": "And our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nJust a few questions about the cash flow and cash CapEx and cash needs. First, I recognize that you're\nnow consolidating in SolarCity. But if you were just to very roughly give us what the old automotive\nadjusted cash flow was and try to kind of disentangle that from the cash flow coming out of the former\nSolarCity, what would that roughly look like directionally?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSure. So I think we put in the letter that cash generation was $70 million, about $70 million. So SolarCity\nwas actually a cash generator for the 5-week stub period. Some of that was the cash and the tax equity\ndeals closing. So the way to think about SolarCity on a go-forward basis is prioritizing cash generations\nthrough preservation over the near term for that business. So I don't anticipate any significant -- it's not\ngoing to have a significant impact on our cash position in future quarters.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nOkay. And secondly, the $2 billion to $2.5 billion CapEx guide, that spend, does that imply that that's not\na full -- couple of questions. Does that imply that's not a full year 2017 number given that production\ncadence that you're planning?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nCorrect. That's between now and the start of production for Model 3.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nOkay. And second, can you talk a little bit more about the deferral of cash out for CapEx due to\nagreements with suppliers or some of those equipment suppliers to defer payments? Just what are those\nagreements? Where does that liability show up on the balance sheet? And then is that a hard -- as soon\nthey deliver a proof part, does that come due? Or how does the actual timing of that payment work?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure, absolutely. So I think this is one of the benefits of having a very successful run over the last\ncouple of years. We have developed a lot of trust with our suppliers. So when I started, we asked, \"Okay,\nwhat's our average days payables outstanding?\" and it was lower than it should be. And we've been able\nto renegotiate the payment terms with just about everybody and stretch out those payables. And it's not\na question of just not paying. It's actually we have trust and we're going -- renegotiating lease contracts\nwith suppliers. And I believe we shared this data point last quarter on the call. But for the parts that\nhave been sourced for Model 3 so far, the average payment terms is 59 days. So cash conversion cycle\nis something that we care deeply about and we're paying a lot of attention to. And obviously, as we head\nup this S curve that we've talked about, working capital is going to be very important. So we're going\nto have to keep a good eye on that. But to sum it up, we're making great progress in stretching out our\npayables, and we're doing that in a way that I think is productive and healthy with the relationships with\nour suppliers and members.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nOkay. So those deferred capital expenditure payments are actually in the accounts payable? Or is it in\nmore like an accrued liability line? Just housekeeping.TESLA, INC. FQ4 2016 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 22, 2017\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nIt depends on if there's -- many payments have milestones set to them, so when the piece of equipment is\nactually installed and up and running. And until you hit that milestone, you don't see a payable."

And I'm just wondering, number one, if that's correct, if I'm thinking\nabout right way, and how that would theoretically impact your business. You've talked about how if sort of\nthese $7,500 Federal -- I know I'm mixing ZEV and GHG and so forth. But you talked about how it could\ntheoretically be a competitive advantage for Tesla, and I'm just wondering if you could sort of opine on\nthat.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, it's just that in order to scale, just to [indiscernible] a week -- it's like 1%, less than 1% or some\ntiny number of vehicles made in that state or sold in that state because we're the only ones who currently\nmake a car in California. And I do think California maybe should do a bit more to support its only\nremaining auto manufacturer to remain competitive. The -- yes, it's weird that they need to do more to\nsupport non-California companies than Tesla. But it's -- this mandate becomes irrelevant at scale. Tesla\nwill have as many more ZEV credits than the rest of the U.S. industry combined. So the value of them just\ndrops to a negligible number. And then they don't [indiscernible] major manufactures. They don't really\nneed to sell them either because they make whatever the puny amount of electric vehicles are, 20,000\ncars maybe. We're making 20x, 30x that number. So this is just -- they're just not as important at scale\nbecause the mandate are too weak.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\nYes, understood. I was just sort of getting at the fact that maybe if the Volt sale in California doesn't count\ntoward New York or something that it's actually -- it's weaker. It's tougher for your competitors than it\neven is today. So that's more what I was alluding to. And I agree with you that the mandate doesn't make\na lot of sense.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. They're just very weak. So -- and yes, so they will have almost no impact on Model 3. Like maybe for\na few quarters, that's about it.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\nOkay, great. And if I may on the Model 3 quickly and then I'll get back in queue. The vehicle we've seen, is\nthat a preproduction version and -- or is that the fully -- the version you plan to fully produce? And if not,\nwhen could we maybe expect to see the fully sort of finished product? Just to get an idea -- you alluded to\nat the Gigafactory a couple of months ago, there is still some suppliers that you want to make sure you'reTESLA, INC. FQ4 2016 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 22, 2017\nlining up properly to get everything ready to go for July 1. And I'm wondering if the revealing of the final\nproduction-ready version could be between now and then sort of an additional catalyst?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. I'm not sure if it kind of makes sense for us to show the final version before starting production\nor after. The initial cars are sort of [indiscernible] actually go to company employees because I think\nit's important for us to have a good feedback with on the product that we're making and if there are\nany issues or valuable things that need to be addressed that we can address those before customers\nexperience them. So I think in terms of showing a final version probably at least a few months away or\nmaybe as far as July itself, it's going to be pretty close to what I showed at the Model 3 unveiling but\nwith more polish and refinement and a few more details that are added. It will be better than what was\nunveiled. And I guess in some ways, it will be a lot better."

Taking a step back, looking at the bigger picture, you previously talked about\nproducing 1 million units per year by 2020, and that's 500,000 units in 2018. How confident are you now\nin both of those targets? And is there anything that need to be done from the battery perspective side in\norder to reach those targets? Would you need to build another Gigafactory prior to hitting 1 million units\nper year in 2020? Or do you think that the current Gigafactory will have enough capacity?\nElon R.

But if you say it's somewhere\naround the 60 to 70 kilowatt hour level, then you need 70 gigawatt hours to get to 1 million. And we think\n-- at the cell level. And then we think the kind of Gigafactory should actually be able to do in excess of 100\ngigawatt hours. So that leaves probably a big Gigafactory 1 can manage -- it can support around probably\n1 million vehicles a year plus maybe something like 30 gigawatt hours or so of storage depending upon\nhow fast the storage market grows.

We try to model it out as carefully\nas possible, but there'll be things that aren't captured in the model and -- but I think in a lot of cases,\nwe'll simply be able to run the lines faster as opposed to duplicate the line and that's like, by far, the best\nCapEx maneuver, is just to make it go faster but -- I would say it's going from 5,000 to 10,000 is probably\n-- it's a total wild ass guess.

Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSure. I think the way to think about it is we're going to continue to drive efficiencies in G&A. We have to\ndo that.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nWell, in parking because we can't fit people in the building.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIt seems like that's the only concern but, like, we're -- it's really quite difficult.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nWe have a real volumetric problem, a good constraint to have.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nSo parking is, like, one of my biggest nightmares, like where do we park everyone? And it's like -- yes,\nyou can't fit everyone. So we have to make our OpEx better because there's nowhere for people to go.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ4 2016 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 22, 2017\nSo we're right at the stage now where G&A will continue to scale sublinearly with revenue. And we'll\ncontinue to always push productivity, productivity, productivity. And then we'll obviously continue to make\ninvestments on the sales side. And even in my new adventures, I'll be calling Jon and asking him about his\nnumbers.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, it's [indiscernible] from a demand generation standpoint, like we don't actually need to make actually\nany investment for Model 3 in the year, probably for the next 12 months. So the -- it's actually, the\ndelivery of the cars that -- where the investment is needed [indiscernible] deliver 3 or 4x as many cars,\nbut we don't have 3x or 4x as many delivery centers. So how do we make that delivery process more\nstreamlined, less paperwork, less bureaucracy, get people at a time, really well-produced instruction\nvideos for how to use their car, although of course, the best instruction would be not having instructions.\nAnd you'll actually be able to like, play all of the instruction for your car on your car. So if you don't want\nto have [indiscernible] look at that. If you look at your email or get on the car but there's -- a sale is\nactually demand generation and then delivery of the car. It's -- that's also part of sales of [indiscernible]\npart and then service. We're deciding on [indiscernible] intervention, like we were -- we increased the\ndesign lifetime of the powertrain to -- from roughly 1/4 million miles to, aspirationally, 1 million miles. So\nthat should really help with service and...\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nI guess just still trying to calibrate to this cash flow and cash needs. Is it -- maybe a different way to ask\nthis is, is it reasonable to expect that you would hit for the motors company free cash flow breakeven at\nthe 250,000 unit a year level for Model 3, assuming what we know today?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIt depends on how quickly we want to ramp production to go from 5k a week to 10k a week of Model 3.\nThere could be an argument that you don't want to go to cash flow breakeven or positive because you're\nessentially -- you're losing a lot of sales. And when you do -- when you calculate the present value of\nthese cash flows, then it's like actually not smart to be, in that case, free cash flow positive. Or you maybe\nwant to be a little negative at least and not give up a huge number of sales because we'd be talking -- the\nnumbers get just so crazy. It's 0.25 million units a year. It's roughly $1 billion a month revenue. And so --\nand you double that and there's $2 billion a month advanced. So maybe spending half -- incremental $0.5\nbillion or -- in CapEx would be a pretty smart move if it advances things by 2 or 3 months.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nYes. So it just seems like at that level of 250,000, you'd be generating probably at least $2 billion of gross\nprofit for Model 3. And if you continue this Model X rate, you're at $2.5 billion of gross from that. So even\nwith OpEx, if it's just under $3 billion and CapEx of just under $3 billion, if you add in D&A, it looks like it's\npretty close. But I understand, it sounds like it's within your control.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIt's within our control. I mean, like, if we were to just level off, we could be cash flow positive right now.\nObviously, we're in the sort of low to mid-20s on gross margin in the car. At a $10 billion a year run\nrate, that's $2 billion to $2.5 billion. So we could definitely be profitable and cash flow positive at that\nlevel, but then our growth rate would be way slower. So it's kind of just really like a series of overlapping\n[indiscernible] NPV streams, like that's obvious the obvious way to look at it. And by the way, guys, it\nwould be great to get some feedback if you think we're not making a smart move. Please tell us, like we'd\nlove to hear your feedback. We'll definitely not going to hit the bull\u2019s-eye every time. We're going to make\nmistakes. And hearing feedback from you would be great.TESLA, INC. FQ4 2016 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 22, 2017"
