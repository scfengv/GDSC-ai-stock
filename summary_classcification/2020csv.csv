,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you, Sherry. First of all, I'd like to thank the Tesla team for exceptional execution in the secondquarter despite tremendous difﬁculties. They've done an incredible job, and it's an honor to workwith such a great team. And just what a great group to work with, like I said, it's just an honorto work with such agreat team. So -- and as a result, we were able to announce our second quarter 2020 results at about 1:15 p.m. Paci ﬁc time in the update deck we"
,"Tesla's fourth consecutive proﬁtable quarter. The automotive industry was down about 30% year-over-year in the ﬁrst half of the year. Despite that massive industry decline,we actually went up. We're also very excited to announce that we're going to be building our next Gigafactory in Texas. It will be about -- I'll just go into a bit of detail on this, and thenI'm sure there'll be a lot of questions. But the location is 5 minutes from Austin InternationalAirport and 15 minutes from Downtown Austin, and it's about 2,000 acres. It's going to basically be an ecologicalparadise. So if anyone is interested in working at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please let us know."
,"California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the western half ofNorth America. And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would alsomake sense in California. So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California. And just toemphasize, we'll continue to grow in California, but we'll be creating a massive factory andCybertruck and Semi programs in Texas. And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much for -- to theTulsa team, the economic development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed. Thewhole Tesla team wassuper impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for futureexpansion of Tesla down the road."
,"We've already started work on the facility, so some initial construction work. After the federal tax credit, Tesla Solar nowcosts $1.49 per watt. So deﬁnitely,think about Tesla whether you want a new roof or Tesla Solar Roof or you want solar on yourexisting roof, either way, we're the company to go to. And then you could also get a Powerwall andhave energy independence and be your own utility. So I think that product is really coming together,and it's only going to get better later this year. And we introduced the ﬁrst production car with more than 400 milesrange. So just very excited about that business potential."
,"On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter ofproﬁtability. This is despite a signiﬀcant impact to our ﬁnancials as a result of suspended operationsof our U.S. factories. To ensure the business remains healthy,we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to personnel and noncriticalpatent projects. On automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, this reduced sequentially from 20% to18.7%. This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operationalefﬃciency due to the various shutdowns. Despite these charges, we continue to make progressreducing our costs, particularly in COGS and operating expenses."
,"With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $48 million ofdeferred revenue in the period. We made the decision in Q2 to pass through savings to customers aroundthe world on some of our products. Our Megapack product achieved its ﬁrst quarterly proﬁt. on Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai. We remainproduction-constrained in this business and are continuing to work towards building additionalcapacity. On cash ﬂows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of $8.6 in the second quarter."
,"Elon Musk: I don't think we can comment on our detailed product road map beyond what's announced. But it would be reasonable to assumethat we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher capacity vehicle ofsome kind. These are likely things at some point. But I do think there's a long way to go with 3 andY and with Cybertruck and Semi. I think we'll do the obviousthings. Thank you very much. Back to Mail Online home. back to the page you came from. Back into the page that you camefrom. The question #1 is, as Tesla continues itsjourney towards the long-term goal of selling 20 million units per year, what are the most importantvehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next 3 to 5 years beyond Model"
,"Elon R. Musk: I think the upgrading ofthe ﬁeet to Full-Self Driving, especially with an over-the-air software update, I mean, may go downas the biggest asset value increase in history as a step change. So overnight, 1 million -- depending exactly on when it happens and when it's allowed in various regulatory jurisdictions,you'd have like, I don't know, at least a few million cars suddenly becoming 5x more valuable orsomething like that, something like 5x higher utility. We're already putting some games andstuff on the car, just for fun. But they're all very tiny compared with like the step change to Full Self-Driving, dependingupon how you calculate it, is probably worth at least $100,000 per car. So that's a lot of softwareyou have to sell in the App Store or whatever, yes."
,"Elon Musk: The major milestone that's happening right now is really a transition of the autonomysystem of the cars like AI, if you will, from thinking about things in, I call it like, 2.5D. It's like --think of taking like isolated pictures and doing image recognition on pictures that are harshlycorrelated in time but not very well. So that architectural change, which has been underway for some time but has not really beenrolled out to anyone in the production ﬂeet is what really matters for Full Self-Driving. The third question is also about Autopilot. What are the most important upcoming self-drivingmilestones? And how do you think about timing?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director"
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we bring a massive amount of effort into manufacturing engineering, the machine that makesthe machine. There's probably 1,000%, maybe 10,000% more engineering required for the factorythan for the product itself. We're getting way better at making cars. You can see that in Giga Shanghai. You'll see that evenmore with Berlin. The fundamental architecture of Model Y will be different in Berlin. It may lookthe same, but the internals will be quite different and fundamentally more efﬁcient architecturally than what we've done to date."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. concept is not justautomation but minimizing the number of process steps and complexity involved in themanufacturing system. It involves really integrating design and manufacturing across from likewhen the raw materials enter the factory to the ﬁnished goods exit. And we're learning so muchthrough doing that. Jerome, do you want to...Jerome Guillen - Tesla - President of Automotive DivisionYes. I think the focus for us is increasing CapEx efﬁciency. This is something that we've beenworking very hard for the past 3 years. And you can see that we can build new factories for lessamount."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. It's a better factory for less money and less time. We want every operation to add value to the vehicle. So we do not want any robot that justmoves things or adding parts.Jerome Guillen, President of Automotive Division: ""We want more people. We can't ﬁnd enough people. If we're askingsomebody to do something, are we sure it's useful? Are we asking them to spend their time in a waythat is respectful of their time?"""
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, it's our biggest property, true. And the last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas? Musk: ""Right now, 0. But long term, a lot. ...It's our big property. It's our best property"" He added that the company has no plans to stop making cars in Texas, and that it will continue to invest in the state for the next few years, if not longer. The company is based in Palo Alto, California, but also has offices in California and Nevada."
,"Elon Musk: Long term, Tesla Energy will be of roughly the same size asTesla Automotive. The energy business collectively is bigger than the automotivebusiness. So it's like how big is the energy sector? Bigger than automotive. So -- and in order toachieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think isgoing to be primarily solar and followed by wind. And those are intermittent. So you need to have alot of batteries to store the energy because the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn'talwaysshine. Those 3 things. And the mission of Tesla is toaccelerate sustainable energy."
,"The Megapack is an integrated, rapidly deployable grid-tiedstorage battery of megawatt-hour scale. Autobidder is an autonomousenergy market participation system that does high-frequency trading and ensure...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThat's a bad word. We're not front running. Yes. the battery and solar will both be enormous. And theykind of have to be in order for us to have a sustainable future. And we've got a great product roadmap on that front as well. It's very well received."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. It does grid stabilization at the millisecond level. It's like a UPS, an uninterruptible power supply, of anormal size. But it just ensures that the grid has smooth sailing. And then the batteries, the computers like all interact with each other and make sure that they're working together to make thegrid smooth. And this can be done with the Powerwalls and the Megapacks and the Powerpacks allworking together and interacting with third-party systems as well. Andrew D. Baglino, SVP of Powertrain & Energy Engineering."
,"Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionYes. So we'll start production next year, as we announced before. I'm personally very excited aboutthe project. I can't wait. And the second question is, now that it's time to bring the Tesla Semi to volume production, canyou share more detail on production plans? What weekly production rate is considered volumeproduction? And when does Tesla expect to reach that rate? Tesla Semi will use ourselves, Tesla, to carry our own freight,probably mostly between Fremont and Reno, which is a fantastic test route."
,"Elon Musk: New normal for range is going to be, just in U.S. EPAterms, approximately 300 miles. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efﬁciently and in an environmentally sensitive way, he says. Musk: People don't want to have a -- get to their destination with like a 10 miles range. They want some reasonable margins. So I think 300 is really -- or close to 300 is goingto be the new normal, close to 500 kilometers basically roughly."
,"Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. The next question on insurance. What is the holdup for Tesla insurance outside of California? Willyou release numbers from that part of the business? Will Tesla Insurance be required to participatein the Tesla ride-hailing network as a driver?Elon R. Musk: We're joking before the call that we get the quarterly insurance question that -- from say.comhere. We are working super hard on insurance, and I'll go into a little bit more detail here than I have inthe past.Currently, we have a product in California. As I've described before, it's been quite well received. And I would largely describe it as a fairly standard insurance product with elements of it that areunique to our cars. And so really, ultimately, where we want to get to with Tesla Insurance is with Tesla insurance."
,"The amount of data that is available, with the customer'spermission to use, is not available on any other product or any other vehicle in the world. So thisgives us a unique advantage in terms of information. And we have a decision point here where wecould take the California product and replicate that into other states, or we could delay going intoadditional states and instead put more effort into the telematics side of this. We chose the latter. And where we are now is nearly complete with the risk and cost analysis. We hope to be ﬁling that in a handful of states with regulatorsvery shortly. And assuming that regulatory approvals go smoothly, we hope to have this in ahandful of states by the end of the year. And then we'll continue to  for approval in additionalstates."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean at the heart of being competitive with insurance is what is the accuracy of yourinformation. Like are you dealing with -- are you forced to assess people statistically looking in therear-view mirror? Or can you assess people individually, looking ahead with smart projections, andinform the driver that -- of how they may reduce their -- what actions they can take to reduce theirinsurance. This was actually very helpful for us to have. approval there, we'll continue to roll this out nationwide as quickly as wecan."
,"Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSorry. Will Tesla Insurance be required to participate inthe Tesla ride-hailing network? Yes. It's notdecided whether third-party insurance versus Tesla Insurance will be required. There might be somethings we need to think through there. But Tesla Insurance, at least, will be working, working for the ride-Hailing network. Okay. Thank you very much. Back to the page you came from. Back into the room. Back in the room, back to the front. Back up to the back. Back down to the floor. Back on the floor, back into the back of the room and the front seats. Back onto the front, the front and the back seats. The front and back seats will be the same. The back seat will be different."
,"Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Just to start with the gross margin questions. We did see progress on gross margins in China,and that was despite pricing action that was taken. The factory is still not running at full capacityyet as it was in the first quarter. Thank you very much. And in the interest of time, let's go to the Q&A of analysts on the line.OperatorOur ﬁrst question will come from Dan Levy with CrÃ©dit Suisse.Dan Meir Levy - CrÃ ©dit Su Swiss AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalyst"
,"Model Y , as we mentioned last quarter, was proﬁtable in its ﬁrst quarter of production. And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structurewill converge. They're not quite there. Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, andit's not yet at full production. With Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kindof back into the math there on the relative gross margins. Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory. But -- and it's continuing to do more andmore internally. But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton ofparts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai. And just locally sourcing those components"
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. The suppliers in China have been extremely competitive, possibly the mostcompetitive in the world. There is also a lot of very strong, very competent and very eager suppliers around the factory in Shanghai. Also a lotof suppliers in Germany or the rest of Europe, they are eager to support the factories in Berlin and Shanghai. And so far, we're in negotiations with -- for Berlin, and we've awarded a lot. of business. It will be like 80% by the end of this year, maybe more, Jerome Guillen. has literally been rising at like 5%to 10% a month. From 40 -- it was like 40% at the beginning of thisyear, something like that."
,"Zachary J. Kirkhorn - CFOSure. in the slide deck a couple of times that you were pleased with gross margin, withPTI margin progress and you expect it to achieve industry-leading operating margins over time. Industry-leading for luxury vendors is 8% to 10% PTI. For Porsche, smaller, at 17%. For mass market vendors, it's 5% to 8%. What do we think about?And how much, ultimately, do you believe that EV credits will contribute to that margin? Because Iknow your margin has been 5% over the last 12 months, but it's actually less than 1% excluding EVcredits. So it's a 4-point contribution right now. And how much of that you think is coming from EV credits, regulatorycredits? And I have a follow-up, please. I do expect regulatory credit revenue to double in 2020 relative to2019, and it will continue for some period of time. But eventually, the stream will continue to increase, and that's what we're looking forward to in the future, Zachary."
,"Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce, manufacture and distributeour cars. That cost curve even for mature products like the S and the X continues to come down. And then you can layer on top of that in thefuture our revenue from the ride-hailing network. Yes. There's still incredible opportunity there that we're working on, particularly on how customersinteract with the company from sales. And yet our sales havecontinued to do well. And we're -- buyers of our car in the U.S. received 0 federal tax credit.Whereas many of our competitors are like, they get a $7,500 fed credit."
,"In the medium term here, what our modelingshows is in the low-teens operating margin level. And I think there continues to drive -- theopportunity to drive that up. So we're on a bit of a journey here, and we're continuing tobe [partners].A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystAnd if I could just follow up, Elon, you've talked a lot about the mission of the company in -- andreally trying to drive EV adoption globally. So how do you think about that trade-off betweendriving towards industry-leading proﬁtability, yet trying to make your cars more affordable andbroader?"
,"Elon Musk: I think we can go waybeyond industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people. That was really a mega game changer, gigagame changer. But I mean it is important for people to distinguish between 2 things. There'svalue for money that our product has, and then there's affordability. And even if you rail value formoney and have value for money like inﬁnite, if people don't have enough -- if people do not haveenough money in their bank accounts to buy the car, they simply cannot. So then you used -- havethis like awesome thing that nobody can buy."
,"Elon Musk: We're not trying to be super proﬁtable either. Obviously, we'relike -- pro-tability is like 1% or something. We want to be pro-table and maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible. That's whatwe're trying to achieve. We do have some production. We're making progress in that regard, justsort of steadily gaining progress. So yes, we need to not go bankrupt. Obviously. that's importantbecause we'll fail in our mission. We need to ﬁx that. It's not crazy. Last quarter, it was only like 0.1%."
,"Elon Musk: The things that aretroubling us right now are not demand, but they are just a bunch of ﬁreﬁghting on supply chain andproduction issues. For example, the Model Y rear body casting, obviously, because it'snew technology, it's been tricky to maintain rates and keep growing the rate for Model Y casting. In fact, I'm super excited about this. We're goingto have a -- the world's biggest casting press is getting assembled right now actually in Fremont forthe Model Y front body casting. It's enormous and looks awesome. The Model Y is a 2-piece casting with a bunch -- and there's about half a dozen other parts that areadded on. That will transition to a 1-piece Casting. That's what we're trying to solve right now."
,"The number of rabbits we've had to pull out of ahat for supply chain is insane. So I think also -- so yes, some ofour costs were related to having to use a lot of airplanes to get parts around because of partshortages. So we'll hopefully use fewer airplanes. But it's -- demandexceeds supply right now. That's where we are right now, and that's what we're going to focus on for the rest of the year.OperatorOur last question today will come from Philippe Houchois with Jefferies. Philippe, could you please clarify the scope of the Berlin plant you're building right now?

,"Elon Musk: 2020 was a deﬁning year for us on many levels. Despite achallenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5million cars. Wedelivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history. So really an incrediblegrowth rate and despite a very challenging 2020. So my hat is off. It's such an such an incredible effort. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. Welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2020 Q&AWebcast. We will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements."
,"Full year, we achieved free cash ﬂow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3billion on building new factories and other expenditures. We reached industry-leading GAAPoperating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash. We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and almost reached full productionspeed. We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, andShanghai continues to grow rapidly. We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles. We're also building Giga Berlinand Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year."
,Model S and Model X Plaid are in production now and will be delivered in February. Model S Plaid will be the ﬁrst production car ever that isable to go 0 to 60 miles an hour in under 2 seconds. Model X is a tri-motor Model S with a completely new interior. It's really a tremendous improvementover the prior version. And so Model S will be delivery in February andModel X a little later. The Model S is in production right now and we'll bedelivering next month. We're super excited to announce the new Model S and Models X are inProduction now and are inproduction right now. We are launching the -- we're really excited to announced the newModel S. abattery cell factory.
,"The Tesla Model S goes from 0 to 60 in less than 2 seconds. It can seat up to 7 people with the third-row seats. Tesla will be raising the price of the Model S by $10,000. It's the fastest accelerating car ever made for roads in history, Musk says. The Model S will go on sale in a matter of weeks, he says, and it will be ""the best car of any kind at any price available in the world today"" The company is also working on a self-driving version of its Model S, which will be on sale later this year, he adds. The company will announce more details about that later this week or next, he tells CNN's John Defterios."
,"Tesla's self-driving software is improving rapidly. I'm highly conﬁdent the car will be able to drive itselfwith reliability in excess of human this year. This is a very big deal. If Tesla ships,let's say, hypothetically, $50 billion or $60 billion worth of vehicles and those vehicles become FullSelf-Driving and can be used in robotaxis, the utility increases from an average of $1,000 to $10,000 per car. That's a huge increase. That would be a huge benefit to Tesla's shareholders. It's a very exciting time for Tesla, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the future holds for the company, and for the world, in the coming years. I think it's going to be very exciting to see how far this technology will take the world and the world's car industry in the next few years. It will be a game-changer."
,"On cash, we continue to generate strong free cash ﬂows, reaching a record $1.9 billion in Q4. For net income, we achieved our ﬁrst calendar year and 6 sequential quarters of proﬁtability. Inaddition, auto gross margin, excluding credits, improved from 2019 to 2020 despite reductions inASP and inefﬃciencies from new product launches and transitions. And I think our CFO, Zach Kirkhorn, has some opening remarks as well. Thank you very much.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. As Elon mentioned, 2020 has been an extremely successful year whilemanaging through many unforeseen and unexpected challenges."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So we're actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year. And we hadour best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4. So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar. And actually, an important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwalland the Tesla retroﬁt solar and Tesla roof. And so that's something that we'veaccomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the place that it needs to be. And as Elon mentioned, this is a really important part with industry-leading pricing to become theleader in the space."
,"The second question is, could current owners get ability to transfer their FSD to theirnext vehicle? This would be huge for loyalty and overall increase sales of vehicles while offeringmore FSD sales on the used vehicles.Unfortunately, we're not considering that at this time. We do actually offer an increased -- higherprice than -- for a car with FSD than the one without FSD. And I do think that the market currentlyundervalues -- the consumer market and arguably the stock market probably undervalue just howgood FSD is going to be. But we're Not currently planning on offering -- on allowing it to gettransferred. Thank you. Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director"
,"We will be offering subscription pretty soon, in the next month or 2. So that should address a lot ofpeople's concerns about being able to get it. Thank you.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director. We are happy to answer any questions you may have about our service. Please contact us at [email protected] or on Twitter @teslamotors. We would like to make it clear that Tesla is a private company and not a subsidiary of any other company. We have no plans to make any changes to our service in the near future."
,"The in-house cell manufacturing system we revealed at Battery Day contains newprocesses and equipment. We did expect some unknown unknowns and technical challenges toarise through the production ramp. The Kato team, however, has been able to solve eachmanufacturing problem presented to date. And from a capacity perspective, we have 10 gigawatt hours worth of equipment landed at Kato. The production staff is nearly all hired. Our material supply chain is established and the team is ontrack for full production ramp this year. Meanwhile, we've developed enough engineeringconﬁdence with our 4680 design and the production process and equipment to kick offmanufacturing equipment and facility construction to support our 100 Gigawatt hour 2022 goal."
,"Elon Musk: It's not remarkable at all for the car tocompletely drive you from one location to another through a series of complex intersections. It'snow about just improving the corner case reliability and getting it to 99.9999% reliable with respectto an accident.Basically, we need to get it to better than human by a factor of at least 100% or 200%. And this ishappening rapidly because we've got so much training data with all cars in the ﬁeld. And thesoftware is improving dramatically. The -- we also write the software for labeling. And I'll say it'squite challenging. We're moving everything towards video labeling, allvideo inference. And so there are still a few of the neural nets that need to be upgraded to videotraining. And really, as we transition each net to video, the performancesbecome exceptional."
,"The next question is, what is Tesla's current gigawatt hour run rate of the 4680 cellproduction? How do you see this run rate evolving by mid-2021 or end of 2021?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And we don't see any showstoppers.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla,. Inc. -- SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Agreed, Elon. Thank you. The next question was, what are your thoughts on Tesla's potential growth rate in the next few years? Elon Musk: We are progressing up that S-curve as fast as we possiblycan. We are installing capacity for -- in 2022 for 200 Gigawatt hours a year, and wethink probably we should be able to achieve 30% of targeted design capacity."
,"Tesla had a reputation for outstanding customer service. Now it'simpossible to even call a service center, and appointments are scheduled weeks out. Jerome?Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionYes. Well, as far as best service, no service, so we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the qualityand the reliability of our cars. In the last 2 years, the frequency of service visits are reduced by 1/3. So we're trying to service the cars very quickly so people can get their vehicles back on theroad. Thank you very much. And one more question is from the retail investors. What is Tesla doing toimprove service experience? Tesla had a rep for outstanding service. It's now impossible to evencall a service centers."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So it really goes back to what I was saying a moment ago, which is we need to transition overthe neural nets in the car to video. That means gathering video clips than using -- and this is actuallysurround video. So you've got 8 cameras operating simultaneously with synchronized frame rates. Yes. I really do see this as a question of getting work done. We're getting it done. And you can see theresults in the rapidly improving FSD betas that are leased. And we're also going to be expanding theFSD beta itself to include more and more people. So from my standpoint, it looks like a very clear and obvious path towards a vehicle that will drive100% safer than a person."
,"Elon Musk: I think we're very open to licensing our software to third parties. And we've had some preliminarydiscussions about licensing Autopilot to other OEMs. We haven't thought as much about Autobidder, butthe Tesla philosophy is deﬁnitely not to create walled gardens. We're going to allow othercompanies to use our Supercharger networks, and yes, using our autonomy software andAutobidder and perhaps other things, we'd be ﬁne to. Thank you. Back to the page you came from. The second question from institutionals is, does Tesla plan or expect to license anyof its software applications, FSD and Autobidger in particular, to third-party OEMs? The answer is yes, we're more than happy todo."
,"Elon Musk: We currently are winning that -- we are currently the leader in the Chinese EV market. So Ithink we're must be doing something right if we're the best-selling electric car in China. That said,very few of our customers in China, I think maybe as low as 1% or 2%, actually have selected theFSD option. This is much lower than rest of world. So we deﬁnitely need to make it work well inChina. I think as soon as it works well in China,. then we will have the take rate for FSD. And hopefully, that is later this year. The next question is, key differences in product, customer preferences, FSD strategybetween China and the rest of the world. Do we need to do things differently to win the ChineseEVmarket?"
,"The fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability ofcells, what's the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours. And you can't grow faster than that. Nowat Tesla, we've improved the efﬁciency of our cars dramatically. And withsome slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with the Standardpack, an order of 500 kilometers. But fundamentally,the growth is dependent on cell production. And there's obviously a lot of other companies thatwant to -- that have a need for cells. So there's ef ﬁCIency improvements in the car. But there's also a lot more work to be done."
,"The next question is about 4680 cells, which we already covered in the retailsection of this call. So let's go straight to the last question from institutional investors. What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in2021?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorAll right. So we're no longer iterating atthe design center level or design level. We've got the designs ﬁxed. And I think it's going to be an incredible vehicle. If we get lucky, we'll be able to do a fewdeliveries towards the end of this year, but I expect volume production to be in 2022."
,"The rest of the world is fairly dynamic. In Europe, we see a general slowdown, generally notreaching past Level 3 right now. The -- what we're seeing right now in the U.S., for example, is a pretty dynamic space, but it'soverall not particularly limiting on a rule basis. What we're going to expect is to have to workwith regulators to demonstrate really, really high reliability, as Elon said before. Thank you very much. And now we can start with questions in the queue.OperatorOur ﬁrst question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer."
,"We expect a pretty dynamic 2021 in the regulatory space. China showed an interest in working on Level 4 or even Level 5 later this year. We are entering aseries of long-term agreements with preferred suppliers to ensure that not only we're going to haveenough quantity to support the growth, 50% CAGR. But we're also lookingforward to pricing, and we're watching this very closely for all the components. And our priority now is to deal with the disruptions fromCOVID and shipping, in particular, boats between Asia and North America. And we're entering into long- term agreements with Preferred Suppliers to ensure we have enough quantity for the growth we're experiencing. We're looking forward to a very, very exciting 2021."
,"Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. On the regulatory credit sales side, this is always an area that's extremely difﬁcult for us toforecast. 2020 regulatory credit Sales ended up being higher than our expectations. In the long term, regulatory creditSales will not be a material part of the business, Zachary Kirkhorn said. On capital, what should we think about the use of those funds beyond just covering someof the maturities? And can you just give us a sense of what the elevated liquidity does and doesn'tbuy? To what extent does elevated capital enable you to accelerate plans on buildingcapacity or expanding vertical integration, accelerating timing on full self-drive features? So thoseare the questions."
,"Most of our regulatory credit revenue from Q4 was not lined up prior to the beginning of thequarter. So I wish Icould give you more on this, Dan, but it's a space that's extraordinarily difﬁcult for us to forecast. It's possible that for a handful ofadditional quarters, it remains strong, it's also possible that it's not. and we don't plan the business around that. And so debt reduction is important. That's helpful on interest expense as well. We are also using the money with respect to our investments in future capacity. and so what we'reable to do now that we haven't had the opportunity to do in the past."
,"Service expansion is really important to thefuture strategy of the company. we're building capacity,particularly in Austin and Berlin, we can build that capacity with the expectation of what the endstate of capacity will be. And so we're able now to make investments there and also in the Superchargingnetwork to get ahead of future demand, which will cost us more in the near term but is what theright long-term thing is for our customers and the company, says Jerome.OperatorOur next question will come from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler.Alexander Eugene Potter - PiperSandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior ResearchAnalystGreat. Was wondering, you mentioned how you'd like to build out your Supercharging network. Could you give us an idea of how you would like to do that?"
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorNo, it does not. Although we are talking with them about making the 4680 form factor, but they -- itis not required. For example, the new S currently uses the 18650 form factor. So they're just a moreadvanced cell, and we think we'll continue to use that form factor for at least a few years. But wewill, over time, be retiring the form factors and try to move to a consistent form factor in the future, he said. Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior ResearchAnalystOkay. And then one additional maybe qualitative question."
,"Elon R. Musk: Access to dollars is one thing, but access to human beings thatare suf ﬁciently qualiﬁed is another. That is one of the things that -- or limits the growth rate. It doesn't limit the ultimate size. It limitsthe growth rate, which is what's the rate at which we can onboard great people and get them trainedin the right areas. And at least I'd like to -- yes, at least at least 50% per year for many years to come. I thinkthis year, we may track to track to 50% this year."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think Tesla is deﬁnitely going to make an electric van at some point. The thing to bear in mind isthat there is fundamentally a constraint on battery cell output. It's like -- if one is not involved inmanufacturing, it's really hard to appreciate just how hard it is to make electric vans. a fair bit above 50%, but we don't want to commit to that. But at leastthat's what it would appear, and the same again next year. It appears to be meaningfully above 50%.OperatorOur next question will come from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.Joseph Robert Spak - RBC capital Markets, Research Division - Autos and Leisure Analyst"
,"A big part of the reason -- the main reason we have not accelerated new products is that we simply don't have enough cells built. Like we -- this -- if we were tomake the Semi like right now, which we could easily go into production with the Semi, but wewould not have enough to cells for it right now. Thesame would go for a van. It's the hardestthing in the world. Prototypes are easy. Scaling production is very hard. But it willabsolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint.Joseph Robert Spak - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Autos and Leisure AnalystOkay. And then maybe if I could dig into your past on one more item. About about the Tesla Semi. About theTesla Semi. about theTesla van. About. the Tesla Model S. about. the Model X."
,"Elon Musk: ""The software still does not fully use the capabilities of theFSD version 1 computer"" ""The version 2, we expect to be about 3x as powerful. And this needs to be paired with higher-resolution cameras"" ""It's coming along well and it's in good shape,"" he says. ""It would actually be adistraction right now if we were to introduce the Full Self-Driving -- the Tesla FSD chip 2 becauseit would set us back quite a bit on software"" ""Software is the critical path to Full. Self- Driving,"" he adds. ""I'm personallycertain that you can create Full self-driving with safety Level 5"""
,"So I wouldn't worry too much about that. That's not a -- that's an improvement but not a gamechanger, the FSD 2. Getting the software to work and getting all the neural nets to be video, that'sthe game changer.Andrew. Drew? It's not like year 1. So 3, maybe 4 years, give ourselves a little room. But for 3 or 4 years,. I'd say, yes. Andrew. Drew. The next question will come from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystMy ﬁrst question is about your in-house cell manufacturing efforts. So in addition to building upcapacity, some of the goals you highlighted was to cut the pricing or the cost by about 50% over a number of years."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. We're aspiring to do better than what was presented at Battery Day, but we are conﬁdent of atleast doing what we presented at battery day. We put together the trajectory in the battery day, and we're on that trajectory still. I think that'sprobably the best reference for the cost trajectory that we are on. And then we have -- you're going to Hawaii andsee Larry and the X.com, and I'm trying to put it all together. So there's a lot of questions there. And I expect to be CEO of Tesla for several years."
,"I do -- I think I do probably more -- Ideﬁnitely do more technical work than is typical for a CEO. So it would be nice to have a bit morefree time on my hands as opposed to just working day and night, from when I wake up to when I go to sleep 7 days a week. Pretty intense. But I think the mission isn't over yet, and we still got a long way to go before we can reallymake a dent in the world on accelerating the advent of sustainable energy. I mean the goal of Teslafrom beginning has been to accelerate sustainable energy, but it's still very, very tiny, like an order of 1% or lessthan 1%."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. That's true, yes. As it is, we need to modify the parameters. Software parameters change forAutopilot or Full Self-Driving because it needs to know if it's in a Model 3, Model Y , Model X orModel S. And so this is -- we just need to inform the software. And then the hardware...Jerome Guillen - Tesla. - President of Automotive DivisionIt's the exact same part numbers on the Semi based on the Tesla cars. There's no difference. And let's take the last question, please.OperatorOur last question will come from Gene Munster with Loop Ventures."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorNo. I think there will be -- you have different control functions because there are turns that you cannot do in a Semi. Like you don't want to try to parallel parkthis thing on the street in a city. It needs to know its limitations being a giant truck.Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-founder & Head ofResearchMakes sense. My follow-up question was related to if you could just help us explain why batteryelectric will win versus hydrogen cell fuel tech. Elon Musk: I mean honestly, I've had this question a million times for -- just for regular vehicles, even backin the early Roadster days, even before we had the Roadster out. People were saying that somehowhydrogen is going to be a better means of energy storage in a car than batteries."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThanks so much. All right. And unfortunately, that's all the time we have today. So thanks forall of your great questions, and we will speak to you again in about 3 months. Thank you.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Youmay now disconnect.

,"Elon Musk: Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the ﬁnal few weeks. Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatorycredits, while ramping 2 major products. What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviouslylearned a lot here. After all -- after the Model 3 ramp from 3 years ago, our new products get new products. After the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. (Operator Instructions) The call is being webcast at the following link: Tesla's First Quarter 2020 Q&aWebcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today."
,"In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the ﬁrst quarter thanModel 3s in Fremont. Most surprisingly -- Model Y was proﬁtable already in its first quarter ofproduction. We are collecting data from over 1 million intersections every month at thispoint. This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update. Soon, we will be collectingData from soon-to-be-released self-driving cars. We feel quite good about and where we feel that it is probably asafety improvement. The Model Y ramp has been even faster thanthe Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1. runfaster and become pro-table sooner."
,"Over 1 billion intersections per month. All of those conﬁrmations are training on neural net. We're quite literally orders ofmagnitude more than everyone else combined. I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we're quite Literally orders ofMagnitude More than Everyone Else Combined. We really feel we're -- I feelextremely con ﬁdent that it will be possible to do a drive from your home to your ofﬀce most of thetime with no interventions by the end of the year. So this is -- we can almost do this already. It's very difﬃcult to have a search engine that competes with Google becauseeveryone is training Google all the time with their searches."
,"Teslaspecial. with theleading-edge alpha builds driving in the car. We increased the range of Model S and X yet again, thistime to 391 miles. As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we're actually conﬁdent that we will achieve a 400-mile or greater range with the Model S. For Model Y , we introduced a revolutionary 2-piece rear rear. We're looking -- we're going to continue pushing for improvedrange over time and improving handling, acceleration and all the little details that make Teslaspespecial. With the new Model Y, we're introducing a revolutionary two- piece rear for the first time."
,"Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents ofModel 3s built in Fremont. We also announced a long-range andperformance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China. On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of governmentincentives at the end of Q4. In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again. And now to Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla teamthis past quarter. A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned. We successfullylaunched, ramped and demonstrated proﬁtability of the Model Y , as Elon mentioned. This is our second large-scale product launch since Model 3 in 2017, and it'sevidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp ef ﬁciency."
,"Automotive grossmargin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products. We continue to make progress on OpExefﬁciency as well as our service and other margins. Our energy business was impacted as well byshutdown activities in Q1, limiting deployments. We are taking the near-term actions required to continue thoseinvestments. Model Y remains on track to achieve our long-termplans and technology road map, and we will continue to invest in this area. We expect regulatory credit sales, which are credits we sell to other carmakers, to generally increase with time. This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4. And notethat most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q 1, and it's reﬂected on the balance sheet."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely. As you may be like, at a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area underthe curve of customer happiness. That is our goal. And we think that that's the kind of thing that allcompanies should try to do. And it's what results in long-term value creation. And loyalty begetsloyalty. So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we're conﬁdent thatif we behave like that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us. Thank you very much. So we'll take the ﬁrst questions from institutional investors compiled by SayTechnologies."
,"China recently announced changes to its NEVsubsidy program. To what extentis there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer sothey can qualify for the subsidy? Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production cost in China. And we're actuallyexcited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3basically tomorrow, China time. So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, Chinatime. And that will be a price below the subsidy limit. We feel conﬁdent that, that will still be avehicle that delivers a good gross margin.Zachary J. Kirkhorn -- CFOYes. And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced inShanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's stillsigni�"
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efﬁcient as a company. So I think that there'sclearly an uncertain future ahead. It's a bit of a bumpy road. But I think the long-term prospects areextremely good. Anything you guys want to add? Zachary J. Kirkhorn - CFOYes, I agree with that, Elon. The prioritization on the key projects will enable us to execute moreef ﬁciently and faster on them, which I think is great. Thank you. The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved bycrises. In which way has Tesla improved or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-19?"
,"Elon Musk: We don't want to preempt Battery Day. We want to -- leave theexciting news for that day, but there will be a lot of exciting news to tell. We think probably the right timing will be the -- probably the third week of May. And depending upon whatwe're allowed to do, it will either be in California or Texas. And I think it would beone of the most exciting days in Tesla's history. And we're just trying to ﬁgure out theright timingfor that. Thank you. The next question is from institutional investor is, can you give us a brief preview of theBattery Day by generally highlighting steps Tesla is taking to improve self-energy density and timeline for introduction?"
,"Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSo there's a couple of things on the ﬁnancials for Full Self-Driving. Currently, in North America,it's sold for $7,000 as an option. We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of itgoes into deferred revenue. That's associated with features that will be released with time. Ourdeferred revenue balance is continuing to grow. It's a little bit over $600 million. And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we canrecognize that revenue. So I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful grossmargin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out."
,"Elon Musk: It's possible that it's 40%. I would be very shocked ifit's less than 40% even with force majeure, short of World War III. Thank you. And now let's go to the questions from retail investors. Question number one, Elon hasmentioned a 50% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past. Is this still in line withTesla's ambitions for the next 5 to 10 years? This would be 4 million vehicles in 2025 and morethan 20 million vehicles by 2030. Is 40% a more realistic target?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & Director"
,"Elon R. Musk: We will announce the next Giga possibly as soon as a month. It will certainly be within 3months and possibly 1 month. And that would be in the U.S. So as for how many will be in 5 years? I'm not -- I don't know right now what that number would be. I guess several more than there are today, but some number more than today. And so the absolute number of Giga factories we mayultimately build might be less, but each one is larger. That's under our belief that just signiﬁcantef ﬁciencies by having as much as possible and similar product lines under the same roof."
,"Elon Musk: I think the long-term trend for Solar Roof is extremely good. I'm conﬁdent that, let's say,within the next, I don't know, year -- maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of1,000 a week. That's not in the middle of winter or something. It's like taking seasonality --allowing for seasonality where it's hard to install on roofs that are covered in snow and ice. We're alsoseeing a lot of interest outside of North America. So we do expect this to be a product that isinternational and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from China on the Solar Roof. And internally, we want to have at least 1,000 Solar Roof install teams with -- and taking a week orperhaps a little less than a week to do an install, which gets you 1, thousand a week roof installations. So it's really all about the install. And then like I said alsobuilding out the very diverse group of companies in the rooﬀng industry to alsoinstall Solar Roof that I think will scale -- allow us to scale far beyond 1,00,000 per week. And that's not a problem. We actually have demonstrated the ability tohit 1k a week gross build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already, so that's a problem, too."
,"Elon R. Musk: I'm personally extremely excited to build a kick-ass HV AC system. Model S and X are the only cars in the world that have a hospital operating roomgrade heavy ﬁlters built in. So you can get to a particle count that is insanely lowwith our cars. That's why Model 3 and Y are -- they're no slouches. And 3 andY have like MERV 16 or 15 capable �akltration. Thank you. The next question is, can you elaborate on Tesla's plan to enter the residential and/orcommercial HVAC market? Can you provide some basics of how your system will work? Will youconsider the heat pump water heater market as well?"
,"When will Tesla start acquiring utilities like theHornsdale Power Reserve and Moss Landing instead of selling them battery storage? Does it makesense for Tesla to buy bigger plants and convert them?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we haven't really thought about that yet. It's not out of the question, but our brand is full. Our overarching goal is to helpaccelerate the advent of sustainable energy. And the 3 elements of that are sustainable powergeneration; then you've got to store the power, stationary storage; and then you're got to haveelectric transportation. So -- and we don't have like, say, speciﬁc market share goals or anything likethat."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThanks. Zach, ﬁrst, for you, any real-time update on company liquidity at the end ofApril? Some companies have, given the circumstances, gone out of their way to give a little coloron that. Just want to get your shot at that. And I'd point out, I've had aroot canal before. AndI would agree, Elon, it was less painful than buying a car. Thank you very much. And we can move to analyst questions.OperatorOur ﬅrst question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. As I mentioned in my openingremarks, we do have an increase in inventory of vehicles that we were unable to deliver at the endof Q1. So we're making progress delivering those through April, which is helpful for liquidity. Andas we've been looking at liquidity, we've were looking at this over the next 18 months. And there'sups and downs to the liquidity. But in looking at the long-term horizon, which we're managing it right now, we feelpretty comfortable with the liquidity position of the company. Musk: We are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area,and that should be identiﬁed as a serious risk. We only have 2 car factories right now. 1 in Shanghaiand 1 in theBay Area. And the Bay area produces the vast majority of the cars that we make. It should be identified as a risk."
,"The extension of the shelter-in-place or, frankly, I would call itforcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights, that's my opinion. While Tesla willweather the storm, there are many small companies that will not. And all the people's -- everythingpeople have worked for their whole life is going to get -- is being destroyed in real time. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDElon, on that point, you mentioned people that gave their lives to build the country. There have been a lot of comparisons drawn to the state of the U.S., he said. ""What the (expletive), excuse me, the outrage -- it's just outrage,"" he said of the bill. ""It's causing a lot to strife to a lotof people, yes,"" Jonas said."
,"Elon Musk: It's high time we invested in infrastructure in this country. He says China's infrastructure is much better than ours. Musk: Europe has better infrastructure. It's really quite sad that the U.S.infrastructure, especially sort of roads and highways, is where it is today. And our airports, in a lot of cases, are in a state of disrepair, he says. ""I'm wondering if yousee this as a chance to make the crisis and all the loss and lives lost not be in vain,"" Musk asks. ""It's great. I think it's a great idea"""
,"I think the people aregoing to be very angry about this and are very angry. If somebody should be -- if somebody wantsto stay in their house, that's great. But to say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested ifthey do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This isn't freedom. Give people back their goddamnfreedom. So -- and it's not just a question of money, it's a questionof will. Sometimes, we spend a lot of money on these things, but what are we gaining for it? So -- we really need to be thinking about what is the transportation of the future, not the transportationof the past."
,"A question on Model Y , I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how thegross margin is already positive at such low volume. How much of it is a function of thecommonality with the Model 3? What other factors should we think about? And what does thatmean for the ampler for the eventual gross margin on ModelY?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorZach?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - CFOSure. & Research AnalystA couple of thoughts there for Y . The ﬁrst is it does carry a higher ASP. So on the revenueside, it carries a higherASP than Model 3. And the deliveries that we started with were of thehigher ASP versions of the cars."
,"Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. Sorry, we got disconnected for some reason. What was the question again? Let's go to thenext question, please.OperatorThe next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird.Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - SeniorResearch AnalystSo just wondering about the cell strategy. In Reno, you have, obviously, integrated there. But you'rebuying cells, I think, in Shanghai and then, well, we think in Germany. And so how are you looking at that going forward? And then can you just talk about Mr. Mizuno and that Board addition andkind of the process with adding him to the Board? Zachary Kirkhorn: From a sales perspective, with all the partners we've had historically, in the future, we're justlooking for competitive technology and competitive pricing. I think we'll talk a little bit more aboutthis at Battery Investor Day, like, how we're approaching all of it. But -- so yes, I mean we don'thave like one model we're restricting ourselves to pursue. We're just trying to ﬁnd what's best forthe products in the long run. And then the other question about the Board is about the board. The board is a very important part of our strategy."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think, well, we all need a Hiro. And obviously, he brings tremendous amount of experienceinvesting at the highest levels in the world. And he's a very sensible, smart person who brings a lot to the Board and I think isgenerally recognized as such by many people.Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - SeniorResearch AnalystYes. I was asking about Mr. Mizuno entering the board and kind of the process behind that andwhat he brings to the board. Sorry, we couldn't hear the second part of the question."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorNo. I think this has got nothing to do with the Panasonic relationship. We meet regularly one-on-one and talk all the time. And sothat relationship is strong. Just -- he brings more -- a broader, I think, global strategic view to theBoard.OperatorOur next question will come from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures.Charles Eugene Munster - Loupventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-founder & Head ofResearchCongratulations on the progress. Elon, you talked about full autonomy by the end of the year. Iwould love for you to walk through the rollout strategy of the Tesla Network app and how that'sgoing to look prior to the robotaxi stage. Are you going to gradually take over human routes withautonomous capable routes over time? Or how do you see that playing out?"
,"So we run any car changes through a battery test and simulation. And then we release it to a small groupof private beta testers within the company. Then to a larger beta audience, including people outsidethe company; then to Early Access Tesla owners; and then, ﬁnally, a broad release. And so there aremany stages that these things go through. And the software that's at the very earlystage is much more advanced than what people are seeing.So it just got to go through a very rigorous safety process. So essentially, we need to get very good at extensive testing. And of course,we run it -- we have a simulations team that has, I think, a very good simulation of the real world. And we test the releases in the realworld."
,"The Autopilot's engineering team is -- we just have an extremely talented group, and I'mdeeply involved with the team. So we talk every week and meet every week when we can becausenow physical meeting is difﬁcult. And I feel like we have a tremendous amount of momentum, and we'll have thefunctionality, that's the Full Self-Driving, by the end of the year. Now after that functionality is released, there's still another step, which is to improve the reliabilityof it once it is released. Andthen we keep improving the reliability to a point where it no longer needs to be supervised by thedriver. And we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this is the case. And thenpresumably, the regulators, depending on which jurisdiction it is, will agree."
,"Elon R. Musk: We're going to get owners full autonomy, some level of that by the end of the year and then a human in the loop, Tesla Network app sometime, is it ﬁrst half of next year,would that be the hope? Charles Eugene Munster: The regulatory approvalprocess, that's difﬁcult for us to predict with accuracy because it's out of our hands. But for the restof it, I feel very good about where we are generally, says Munster, co-Founder and head of research at Loup Ventures. The goal is to get approval for theautonomous cars that can drive with no humans onboard. is, would give approval for that, Munster says."
,"Elon Musk: I believe thateverything I've ever said would come true, did come true. It may come true late, but it did cometrue. So punctuality is not my strong suit, but I always come through. I think -- or it might beright but offset by a few weeks to a few months; in some cases, a few years. But I think it's quite likely, in my view -- again, I could be wrong, I'm -- as you see it, we're aheadin some areas, and we're behind in others because -- when I give a guess, I give the guess that Ithink is the likely midpoint, not the point with lots of margin. So then that necessarily means at least half of my predictions will be wrong and half will be right."
,"Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSequential market improvement -- margin improvement?Elon R. Musk - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So I think we couldsee robotaxis in operation with the network ﬂeet next year, not in all markets but in some. in the end.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology Infrastructure. One on gross margin, ﬁrst, and your impressive performance in Q1. The Model Y ramping, even if it broke even, it probably tookaverage gross margin down; and of course, you had like Fremont being closed, shut down the lastweek of the quarter. And so when I looked at how grossmargin evolved sequentially, excluding these 3 moving parts, I felt like your auto gross margincould have been up like a couple of points sequentially."
,"I'll do my best here. a little bit of a hard time hearing the full questionhere because we're having a bit of network difﬁculty in the room. So when welook at margin, we do exclude credit, as you have. Model Y ramping, bringingdown overall gross margin, I agree with that as well. So it was lower than the overall average, andthat will increase with time. And shutdown and ef ﬁciencies in both Shanghai and in Fremont alsoweighed on margin. Even though it'sincreasing quickly and approaching Model 3, it still is below the average. And so I think the sentiment of your question was if you were to remove those factors, was there asequential increase in gross margin. I haven't speciﬀcally calculated that, but I think your intuition isright."
,"Elon Musk: Thank you very much for all your great questions. Unfortunately, this is all the time we have today,and we'll speak to you again in 3 months' time. Thank you, and have a good day.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Youmay now disconnect.

,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. So Q3 was our best quarter in history. We achieved record production anddeliveries, record revenue, record net income, both GAAP and non-GAAP, and record free cashﬂow of $1.4 billion. This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team. I could not bemore proud to work with such a great group of people. Just really (expletive) performance across --throughout the world. Of course, we had our Battery Day. So we hosted -- showed our batteries at our headquarters in California. And we also showed our cars around the world at our booth at the Mobile World Congress in New York City. So that was a lot of fun. It was a great way to kick off the year. And now, we're going to take your questions."
,"I think Tesla's long-term competitive strength will be primarilymanufacturing. And I think we've got apretty good approach to it, which will only get better over time. And we'll continueto iterate on that and just recursively improve the core cell and battery technology. The result, we think, in in. plans for how we can expand in thefuture and improve core battery technology, core cell technology at the form factor level, chemistrylevel and I think most signiﬁcantly at the manufacturing technology level. It's counterintuitive, but I'm quite con ﬁdent this will be what happens. I think it's a very exciting time for Tesla."
,"Giga Berlin will see ourﬁrst battery cell production line at scale. a few years, will be batteries that cost half as much and where the capitalexpenditures required are 1/3 or less of what they are today. And there's a lot of really talented people in that teamwho've worked incredibly hard to make the -- to get the beta release out. And it's just a very smart group of people. So I think we're startingvery slow and very cautiously because the world is a complex and messy place. And so we're -- weput it out there last night, and then we'll see how it goes."
,"It's because everyone is programming it by askingquestions all the time and clicking on particular links. So it's got this great feedback loop, and thatmakes it an extremely effective search engine. It's the same thing for autonomy. Having on theorder of 1 million cars that are providing feedback and speciﬁcally feedback on strange corner casesituations that you just can't even come up with in simulation, this is the thing that is reallyvaluable. But weird cornercases, only a reality can give you that. So that's -- but we're able to say, okay, we need to train thesystem on this corner case situation and look for examples so we can then try it against thoseexamples and improve some very esoteric corner cases."
,"The Tesla China team is just, Imean, incredibly good. Super smart, work hard. It's beyond all reasonable expectations. That is the system that we are developing and aiming to release this year. Then in terms of capacity build out, we're making progress on 3 major factories. We're continuingto expand Shanghai signiﬁcantly, which is going incredibly well.And then we're under construction in Berlin and Texas -- and Austin. So we're also making goodprogress there. Yes. Good. I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin,we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next year. But because of the exponentialnature of the spool up of a manufacturing plant, especially one with new technology, it will start offvery slow at ﬁrst and then become very"
,"Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thank you, Elon. Overall, our ﬁnancial health continues to rapidly improve with Q3 beinganother great quarter on nearly all dimensions, as Elon has mentioned. On net income, we achievedour ﬀfth sequential quarter of proﬁtability, our bestNet income, and nearly double-digit operatingmargins. On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from 18.7% to 23.7%, with some of our programs achieving greater than 25% gross margin. Keep in mind thatinefﬀciencies related to regulatory credits are not included in our financial results for the third quarter of this year, but we expect them to be included in the fourth quarter of 2014. We are tracking to more than double this yearcompared to last. The second andthird tranche of the CEO grant vested during the quarter."
,"Our cash balance increased to $14.5 billion, which includes free cash of $1.4billion, our highest yet. Our operating cash ﬂows were $2.4 billion, including a $600 million beneﬁt from working capital. Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y. In the Energy business, we achieved record storage deployments, aided bythe positive reception of the Megapack and Powerwall products as production and deploymentsgrow. Additionally, our solar deployments doubled, and we're continuing to make progress on thatfront. We continue to reduce ourmanufacturing and operational costs, which is a core component of our cost reduction strategy."
,"As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting theseprograms to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year. We have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash ﬂows to fund. Note that we're currently expecting over $1 billion in earlyconvert paydowns in Q4, primarily associated with the 2021 conversions, but also our 2022 and2024. investments in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin. While we expect thereturn on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope andlocation-speciﬁc costs, the payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we saw in Shanghai and Fremont."
,"Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we're poised for continued strong growth in Energystorage and solar. Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business. We're also aiming to achieve our original 2020guidance of 500,000 deliveries despite the operational interruptions earlier in the year. Our order book is rapidly ﬁlling up through2023 in a multiple of multiple. We have moredemand than supply through 2021. We continue to ramp the product to match unprecedenteddemand across the globe through 2023 and beyond. So congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year. I'll hand it over to RJJohnson, who joined Tesla earlier this year and is leading our Energy business for a fewcomments."
,"Elon Musk: We will incorporate 4680 design solutions into many applications in time across bothenergy and vehicle. And we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the newfactory in Berlin as it ramps. Andrew Baglino: Yes, we will. Thank you very much, everyone. And let's begin with questions from say.com. The ﬁrst questionfrom retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start 4680 cell production at Giga Berlin at the sametime as vehicle production? Can Tesla share more information on what products will use the batterycells from the pilot line in FremONT?"
,"The fundamental limitation on charge rate in lithium-ion batteries is avoiding lithium platingon the anode. While the tabless architecture helps avoid overheating because it's a more power-dense architecture at high continuous charge rates. Electrodesign and anode material choice more directly determines the maximum charge rate. Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question, which is question #2 from retail shareholders. Does Tesla's tabless cell design allow for signiﬁcantly higher peak charging rates? Does it improvethe required taper curve?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes."
,"The third question from retail is, would FSD be able to be transferredto our next vehicle or pay a transfer fee? It would add a broad -- it would add to brand loyalty thesame way gaming companies and cellphone companies keep you in their ecosystem by letting youtransfer purchases to upgraded hardware. I think we'll give it some thought. Okay. Thank you very much.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. We're going to have to wait and see, but yes, we'll have to think about it. It would be a good way to keep people in our ecosystem."
,"The biggest constraintright now in Solar Roof ramp is getting enough installers on board and trained and experienced. We've made a lot of progress on this in Q3, and we're continuing to hire. The next opportunity isimproving the material ﬂow on the job site. Also, we've had great response from third-party rooﬁng contractors as they'reramping up installations for Solar Roof on their customer homes, which is a big source of futuregrowth. The biggest challenge is getting the right packaging, kitting so that every installer on the roof has the parts they need."
,"Elon Musk: Solar Roof is a killer product. This will become obvious next year. I think a future where we've got beautiful roofs with -- generating energy that aretough and resilient and better in every way than a regular roof and alive with energy, that's thefuture we want. Thank you, Carl. Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. You have to say, I think, whatdo you want the world to look like? When you look around the neighborhood in the future, decadefrom now, what do you want? What products are going to make your life better? What future doyou want?"
,"Elon Musk: Tesla is probably -- there's in excess of a dozen start-ups effectively in Tesla. Other car companies, OEMs, they don't own their salesand service. We have to do this in, I don't know, 40 countries, multiple languages. Something thatpeople don't really even know much about is our internal applications team that writes the coretechnology that runs the company.We are not dependent on enterprise software. Thank you. And the last question from retail shareholders is, you recently referred to Tesla as aconglomerate of start-up. What do you suppose will be themost valuable business units within Tesla over the next 5 to 7 years? Could you envision any ofthem ever spinning out from Tesla?"
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWe're -- I think we're going to focus on enabling the robotaxi system. So you can just basically --like that's a sub -- that's just really quite a small subset of the overall robocar thing, where you can have the car be autonomous for you. You can have it be entirely in the network. I mean if you're an Uber or Lyft driver, you could be managing a ﬂeet of 10 cars. It's like you just get more, way more leverage. So Ithink that's sort of -- we could do that. It wouldn't be very difﬁcult, but we'll just befocused on just having an autonomous network that has sort of elements of Uber, Lyft and Airbnb."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Today's boilers and aircon unitsare profoundly unsexy. Could you elaborate on hints that HV AC advances with the Y could also be used in a domestic system. And the second question from institutionals is, residential energy use accounts forroughly the same magnitude of carbon emissions as road transport. Thank you. Andrew D. Baglino, SVP of Powertrain & Energy Engineering, will talk to you about the Model Y and the Model 3 heat pump system."
,"The third question from institutionals is, if meeting your long-term volume targetsrequires price reductions that preclude you from achieving your low double-digit stated margintargets for the auto business, will you still reduce prices accordingly?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we want to make our cars more affordable, and it's really important to separate outaffordability from value for money. If the car is too expensive or any given product is tooexpensive, then -- and people don't have enough money in their bank account, they simply can't buyit no matter what the value proposition is. I do not think we lack for desire for ourproduct, but we do lack for affordability."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. We're ramping up stationary storage a lot. So I mean, it's approximately doubling. We expectit's approximately double next year. So that's pretty good. And hopefully, we can accelerate that inyears to come. And if you just keep doubling things, pretty soon, you hit the mass of the universe,and we'll need to start turning Jupiter into cells. Thank you very much.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd approximately doubling it this year, too."
,"Elon R. Musk: We're trying to derisk 2021 so that there's almost no dependency on ourinternal cell production. The internal cell production will help us ramp in '22,but we're not dependent on it for '21. And our pilot line is pretty big as pilot lines go. It's -- it will be in the top 10 cell factories onEarth, I believe. And the last question from institutionals is, manufacturing is hard. Delays happen. Whatcontingencies do you have in place to ensure that bottlenecks that you might encounter will not preclude you from your ability to hit your Model Y volume targets in Berlin and Texas? Elon Musk: I think it's -- we're -- it's very, very small. Andrew D. Baglino: Yes, that's true."
,"Elon Musk: I think the tricky thing with trying to predict things midway through an exponential isthat if things are doubling every year or even just growing 50%, then if you shift 1 -- plus/minus 1year, it has a huge effect on the number. So -- and it sounds like, wow, you either massivelyexceeded or massively undershot. But it's -- actually, what's going on is a giant S-curve. So a wholebunch of pretty big S-Curves that integrate. Thank you very much. And now we can go to questions from analysts online. Sherry?Operator(Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question will come from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystJust wanted to ask about the targets from your Battery Day. Looked like you could be approachingsomething like 20 million vehicles by 2030 if you hit those goals. Could you maybe share with us alittle bit more of a midterm target, like where would you be by 2025?"
,"It's hard to say. It's like map an S-curve to a $20 million -- a 20 million vehicle target in 2030, and we will slide it around and seewhat that number looks like. That will give you about as much insight as we have. So that's why it's difﬁcult topredict the middle. And I'm not saying for sure we'll hit 20 million vehicles. But it does seem like agood goal to have because that would mean that we're replacing 1% of the global ﬂeet per year.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystOkay. And just secondly, if solid-state lithium metal were to become viable, ifSolid-state Lithium Metal (SSTM) were to be viable, would that be a big step forward?"
,"Elon Musk: The cell production system is fairly agnostic on anode, cathode,electrolyte, separator, that kind of thing. It's quite adaptable. The lithium, like a pure lithium anode is maybe not -- it's not as great as it may sound. Andrew Baglino: Lithium is less volumetrically dense in the pure metal form than it is intercalated into silicon. Elon Musk: Yes. Yes.Andrew D. Baglina - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Elon R. Musk: We could, for example, make ion phosphate or nickelmanganese or something like that. So I wouldn't say just too much more aboutit. Andrew D.baglino - Tesla,. Inc. – SVP. - Powertrain and Energy Engineering. Elon R.Musk: We will change, and we will upgrade, and upgradethe -- all aspects of the cell."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. And then as we showed in our presentation,the total anode cost that we're talking about is only $1 or $2 per kilowatt hour. So the value of likeremoving the anode material isn't super high either. So yes, I fully agree, Elon. The truth is. the truth. But if it turned out that a pure lithium anode is the right move, that would simply --that would be no problem. Agreed.OperatorOur next question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Colin, can you talk about whichprocesses you're moving in-"
,"Elon Musk: Tesla is absolutely vertically integrated compared to other auto companies orbasically most any company. We have a massive amount of internal manufacturing technology thatwe built ourselves. In fact, we design it -- so like, okay, what are thethings we want to make, design a machine that will make that thing, then we make the machine. It gets -- no, no, we don't want to get carried away here. But -- and quitefrankly, we would like to outsource some of our manufacturing processes to other companies. But we're not actually all that opposed to people copying us, but it's quite difﬁcult because you can't do catalog engineering. You can't just pick up the supplier catalog, I'll get one of those machines, one of that machine, bingo, I'm nowTesla."
,"It's like we're just making a crazy amount of machinery internally. This is -- Tesla is notwell understood. If you just walk around the factory, you'd just get a sense for it. And -- yes. I don'tknow if this is like a smart move. But I just know like, hey, if we're trying to make progress andnobody's got the machines that we need, we've got to make it, so we do.Colin William Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior AnalystOkay. And then the second question is really around the balance sheet has really changed. You guyshave run off, land, and you've got a lot more cushion at this point. And obviously, there'sopportunities around insurance to drive out some of the cost of ownership as well as ﬁnancials. How are you guys thinking about that as you move into trying to accelerate demand a little bit andyour ability to leverage your access to capital and enable some of those opportunities? That's the first question. And the second is, how are you thinking about using some of that capital to fund some of your growth initiatives? And the third question is, what are you going to do with the cash that you have left that you don't need to invest in the business? And what are your plans to use that money for?"
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. We're trying to spend money at the fastest rate that wecan possibly spend it and not waste it. We willcertainly waste some of it, but trying to waste, not to waste too much of it is very difﬁcult. Butotherwise, we just try to spendMoney as quickly as possible in a way that is sensible and yieldsmore value than it costs. If LIDAR were totally free, would would you use it? I don't know. If it were totallyFree, would you do it?"
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI mean totally free, well, I think probably -- I think even if it was free, we wouldn't put it on. Amazon appears to be investing and building an autonomous or electrictransport network of some ilk through some organic investments, but also Zoox, Aurora, Rivian, etcetera. I mean I don't know how much he cares about this, but I guess, he sure is investing a lot of money init. If you care about autonomy, you need to focus onvision because the entire road system is based on passive optical. So you have to solve passiveoptical for -- to have a self-driving system that is a generalized solution. And once you solvepassive optical, you've solved self- driving, so why bother with anything else?"
,Elon Musk: We always want to make the car that we deliver be better than the car weunveil. And that's the goal with the Cybertruck. Pierre Ferragu: How fast do you expect to ramp volumes? Then I have a quick follow-up. Elon Musk: I was in the studio actually on -- last Friday with Franz and the team just going over just sort of some improvements to the Cyberruck.Pierre C. Ferragu with New Street Research: How is the ramp of that product looking like? Elon R. Musk: There's like a lot of small improvementscompared to the previous version.
,"Yes. what was unveiled. I think it's going to be better than what we showed. And yes, it'scool. Like it'sGoing to be made in Austin. So it's kind of dependent on completing that factory. If all goes well, we'll be able to do some Cybertruck deliveries towards the end of next year. I would say there's probably a lot of deliveries in '22 and somedeliveries towards theend of nextyear if things go well.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOkay. And now I'm trying to get a sense of how next year is going to look like. So if I look at yourproduction capacity at the endof this year, it’sgoing to be almost 850,000 units on an"
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI mean it's in that vicinity. Yes. You're not far off. And you're going to increase capacity in Shanghai, open Berlin. So you're probably going to end the year above 1 million units. And so am Iright thinking next year we should expect to deliver like somewhere like between 840,000 and 1million cars during the year?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla,. Inc., - CFOYes. We'll provide guidance on 2021 after next earnings call.Dan Meir Levy - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystJust wanted to start with a question on the quarter. Zach, maybe you could give us a sense of wheredirectionally Model Y and China Model 3 gross margin was in the quarter relative to FremontModel 3? And then just a little more color on the gross margin in the third quarter."
,"Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. On your question about FSD, there was a small amount of that deferred revenue release. It'snot particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter. With respect to product margins,what we're seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really across every product.Dan Meir Levy - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystGreat. And then just as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the grossmargin. Just puts and takes on the gross margin in the quarter? Zachary Kirkhorn: We're generally seeingstrength in Shanghai margin, strength in Model Y margins. And not too far off of this, we're seestrength in Model 3 Fremont, S and X margins. So overall, I think it was quite agood story for the products."
,"Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. about your strategy in Europe. And Ithink your strategy generally has been you cut costs and that allows you to cut price, and you cangenerate the extra volume. So once you ramp in Berlin, what's the reasonable expectation of what pricing mightlook like in Europe? And how ﬂexible are you going to be on pricing to generate incremental regcredit, so margins out of the gate that are a little low, but that are then used for the reg credits thathelp to offset that? Yes. I mean what we're trying to do as fast as we possibly can is get production uphigher so that we're not in a position. where we are prioritizing where in the world we send our production. And there'sdifferent factors to that depending upon when different product changes are made."
,"Elon Musk: There are -- yes, I think that getsat the sentiment of your question. of needing to prioritize again. Jerome Guillen: We continue the development of the Semi. And in particular, Megachargers, we realized thatthe 350-kilowatt or so that we might be looking for cars is not going to be enough for Semi. We're looking for something much more powerful than that, that can achieve essentially charging atﬁrst the Semi as during a break, during your driving time so that you can drive until the next break,yes. So there is no usable or ef ﬁcient time wasted for charging the Semi, that's the goal."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Just a note on the sort of Semi. The Semi does consume a lot of cells. So it's, call it, 4 to 6xmore than a passenger vehicle. Vehicle, 5, 5x-ish. So if we are cell-constrained, it is -- it kind of --it's difﬁcult to ramp up the Semi because there's no cells. That's the only real constraint on Semi's progress. Andjust we found over and over again, we just kept running into cell production limitations. And thenwe're just taking things out of one pocket and putting them in another. So we just need more cells sothat we need to solve the cell constraint."
,"Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-Founder & Head ofResearch. How do you think about Semi impactingfreight longer term? I mean is this something that is nice to have and a complement to all of yourtech in new markets? Do you think that this could be a material business?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-founder, CEO & DirectorI think it's very material for sure. I mean really long term, all transport will go autonomous. Yes.Horses are already autonomous. But all transportwill go autonomous, yes, so including Semi. So itwill be pretty signiﬁcant."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I do think there will be other car companies. I don't think we're going to be the only one. So Tesla, we design and build. We're very vertically integrated. So we'redesigning and building so much more of the car than other OEMs who will largely go to thetraditional supply base and like I call it, catalog engineering. So it's not very adventurous, and itbasically ends up like older products end up looking the same because they's going to the samesuppliers."
,"Tesla is like -- we're probably -- I mean we might be, in order of magnitude, more verticallyintegrated than other car companies. And so you kind of need to make new ingredients, new parts, and then you need --then there's no machine to make those parts. So you have to make the machine that makes the part. And then wealso have to create actually our sales and service and distribution system in, I don't know, somethingin the order of 40 countries, somewhere, it will be over 100 countries. And which we're not now, we certainly will be. So it's just like -- it's not just likecomparing Tesla to a car company, like just comparing just really one facet or dimension of Tesla,we're like maybe 10% in common with other car company."
,"I'm just wondering if there's an opportunity where Tesla couldactually share into the savings that utilities, in particular, could be able to achieve in like gridstabilization. I mean we're already seeing this in Australia, where we're seeing behind-the-meter aggregationthat is providing grid services back to the grid, which effectively reduces the price to the customerand reduces the prices for the grid operator. So you're seeing this trend happening across the globe. And it's going to be at the residential level as well as the commercial level. So I think you're probably right about that. And I mean RJ and Zach, what do you guys think?RJ Johnson - Tesla, Inc. - Global Head of Commercial EnergyYes."
,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorIt will be. wholesale level. So Megapack on one endand then Powerwall on the other side. Those 2 working together in tandem and the software layeron top of it, Autobidder being that, that really is going to help make the grid more efﬁcient usingthe hardware platform and software together.Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Automotive AnalystOkay. And the follow-up question I had was, during the Battery Day, you talked about this cellvehicle integration approach. It's very interesting. And when I look at that -- when I think about it, itlooks like this means that the skateboard designed that"
