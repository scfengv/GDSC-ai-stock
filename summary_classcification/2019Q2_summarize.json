        "paragraph": "Instructions]\nBut before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nThank you. So last quarter, we delivered more than 95,000 vehicles, which is a record for Tesla. Put that in\nperspective, it's nearly an 80% increase in deliveries compared to the second quarter of last year. I think\nit's sometimes hard for people to appreciate when you have a large manufactured item with a complex\nglobal supply chain just how difficult that is. I'm incredibly proud of the Tesla team for being able to do\nthat.\nI think this level of growth is possibly unprecedented. It might be the fastest that any large complex\nmanufactured item has grown in history. So just, I think, really great work by the Tesla team to achieve\nthat outcome, and we expect growth to continue in the future at -- for several years to come at the 50%\nto 100% level. So as I said, I think that is not well appreciated how the quotas grow at that rate.\nBut achieving record number of deliveries is an important milestone and shows the rapid progress we've\nmade in managing a global logistics and delivery operation at high volume. And as I said, all of this was\nachieved thanks to the tremendous hard work of the entire Tesla team.\nModel 3 is once again the best-selling premium vehicle in the U.S., outselling all of its gas-powered\nequivalents combined. In Europe, Model 3 is approaching sales levels of its established premium\ncompetitors, and it was awarded a 5-star rating from Euro NCAP earlier this month. This is in addition to\nModel 3 receiving an overall 5-star rating in the U.S. from NHTSA and -- including earning 5 stars in every\ncategory and subcategory and achieving the lowest probability of injury of any vehicle ever tested.\nMotor Trend also recently selected Model S as the best vehicle they have ever tested in their 70-year\nhistory across all other cars. So Motor Trend, which is arguably the leading authority in evaluating\nvehicles, the Motor Trend Car of the Year is the most coveted award. It's pretty incredible that they would\nsay that Model S in their entire 70-year history is the best vehicle they have ever evaluated. This is\ndespite Tesla not buying any advertising in Motor Trend, and it speaks to their journalistic integrity. That's\nsomething special.TESLA, INC. FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5So -- and since the vehicle that they evaluated, we've actually made -- committed to advancements of\nboth Model S and Model X, including our recent update of a new suspension with active damping capability\nand an all-new drivetrain that's capable of a 370-mile range in the Model S and a 325-mile range in\nthe Model X. We've also issued numerous software updates and improvements that have made Model S\nand Model X faster, safer and added dozens of new features. Just like Model 3, Model S and X have the\nhardware needed for future full self-driving capability.\nAs we look ahead to the rest of the year and into 2020, we remain focused on launching new vehicle and\nenergy programs, further expanding on manufacturing operations and continuing to improve customer\nservice. We remain focused on international expansion because local production is essential to being\ncost-competitive. By the end of this year, we will -- we expect to be producing Model 3s in volume out\nof Gigafactory Shanghai. And as you can see from the photos in our quarterly letter, the equipment\ninstallation there is progressing well. We also have to finalize a location for our European Gigafactory\nbefore the end of the year.\nHere in Fremont, preparations for Model Y production have already begun. Since Model Y has high\ncomponent overlap with Model 3, it should be -- we expect it to be a lot easier to ramp. It's something\nin the order of 3/4 of all the parts are common between Model 3 and Model Y. And we expect many\nmanufacturing costs for Model Y, despite additional content, to be approximately the same as Model 3.\nThis quarter, we opened 25 new service locations and added more than 100 Mobile Service vehicles to our\nfleet. And although our fleets have a total -- Tesla fleet size has doubled in the past 12 months, which is\nagain just kind of a crazy thing to consider that Tesla is almost doubling all cumulative production every\nyear. This is a totally mad thing to make as many cars in a year as we've made in our entire history and to\nhave that be an ongoing trend, I think it's difficult for people to really feel an exponential. We didn't evolve\nto feel an exponential. We can feel a linear, but we can only understand an exponential at a cognitive\nlevel.\nBut Tesla is expanding at an exponential rate. And in fact, if you look at the Tesla cumulative deliveries\nchart like year-over-year cumulative deliveries, it's about the cleanest exponential graph I've ever seen.\nSo obviously, if that trend continues, the results, I think, are going to be pretty amazing. And I think that\nwill continue.\nSo we've been able to improve service considerably. You can imagine that if -- obviously, if we're doubling\nour fleet every year, managing service is quite difficult. It's like a total -- because service scales as not just\nwith new production but as the total fleet scales, service needs to scale. And we want to scale service in a\nway that's sensible from a cost standpoint. But it's really quite a difficult challenge to scale.\nNonetheless, we've made massive improvements in service, especially in parts waiting -- time to wait for\nparts and collision repair. And we've in-sourced a great deal of the collision repair activities, which has\nhad, I think, quite a good effect on customer happiness. And this will continue in the months to come.\nSo it's a very important milestone. I think we believe Tesla has -- is now at the point of being self-funding,\nand we expect to be cash flow -- free cash flow positive in future quarters with the possible temporary\nexceptions around the launch and ramp of new product. From a profitability standpoint, we expect to be\nprobably around breakeven this quarter and profitable next quarter. So that's -- I feel pretty confident\nabout that.\nAnd then in terms of deliveries, we expect deliveries to be between 360,000 and 400,000. We expect\nproduction to be a slightly higher number than that and demand to be a slightly higher number than\nthat. So people often confuse deliveries, production and orders for Tesla, and they're actually 3 different\nnumbers. So yes, you obviously cannot deliver more than you make, and so typically, we will make more\nthan we deliver. And then demand generation activities kind of move in kind of like -- to get together with\nproduction like it doesn't make sense to put a lot of effort into demand generation if production can't meet\nthe demand.\nAnd likewise -- so what tends to happen is that we'll solve the production issues, then say, okay, we need\nto increase demand -- address demand then we may increase production, then increase demand. AndTESLA, INC. FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6like I truly get caught up in these details a lot, but if you look at the actual results, like I said, look at\ncumulative deliveries over time for Tesla, cleanest exponential we've ever seen, extrapolate that curve.\nSo there's a tremendous amount to be excited about at Tesla, and we'll have more share in the coming\nweeks and months. Zach, is there anything you'd like to say about our results?\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. And thanks, Elon. A few things I want to highlight before moving into the Q&A. Overall, Q2 was\na strong quarter for Tesla. I'm extremely proud of the team for the progress we've made. We've achieved\nrecord vehicle production and delivery, record storage production and deployment, record services\nand other revenue with a corresponding reduced loss. As we've mentioned a few times, we stabilized\ninternational logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes. And we saw gross margin improvement\nin nearly every aspect of the business, adjusting for the impact of regulatory credit revenue.\nAs a result of these accomplishments, we once again achieved strong free cash flows, which is only\npartially attributed to working capital benefits. We also successfully raised roughly $2.4 billion in net\nproceeds in May. Thus, we exited the quarter with $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, the highest in\nour history. Our net loss reduced significantly relative to Q1, aided by higher volumes in progress on cost\nefficiencies.\nA few things to note. There's $117 million within operating expenses for restructuring. We had a\nsequential reduction of $104 million related to regulatory credit, which is inherently lumpy. And in our\nother income line, we saw a $66 million reduction. This is nearly entirely due to foreign exchange, which\nwe don't hedge.\nGAAP automotive gross margin only reduced slightly despite the reduction in credit revenue and expected\nreductions in our vehicle average selling prices. Adjusting for the impact of credits, automotive gross\nmargin improved materially. For Model S and Model X, ASPs are impacted by pricing actions applied to\ninventory of vehicles built prior to the launch of our powertrain and suspension upgrades in April, the\nmajority of which were sold and delivered in Q2.\nFor Model 3, global ASPs stabilized during the quarter at roughly $50,000, a sequential reduction, yet\ngross profit per Model 3 improved, representing the continued success of our cost management efforts.\nNote that we continue to defer a significant portion of revenue associated with full self-driving, which will\nbe recognized in future periods upon the release of additional features.\nOperating expenses, net of restructuring, continues to improve as well despite the increases in volume,\nreflecting the immense focus on improving our operating efficiency. And while operating expenses and\ncapital expenses may appear to be unnaturally low this quarter, that's not the case. Rather, these reflect\ncontinued progress on cost efficiency and ability to scale our core technologies and processes.\nIf we take a step back here, I think it's important to remember that Tesla is on a long-term journey,\nand it's difficult to see the full picture looking quarter-to-quarter. We committed that Model 3 will be a\ntransformative product, both for the industry and our business. 3 years ago, we unveiled the Model 3. 2\nyears ago, we brought the product to market. 1 year ago, we demonstrated our ability to build the Model\n3 at high rate.\nSo far this year, we've demonstrated our ability to manage global deliveries and logistics at a higher\nrate, but the most important thing is that we've demonstrated our ability to generate significant organic\ndemand as nearly all orders generated in Q2 were nonreservation holders. And thus far in Q3, our order\npacing is ahead of where we were at this point in Q2. And as we noted in our Q2 production and delivery\nrelease, our order backlog increased over the course of Q2.\nUltimately, the Model 3 is accomplishing what our business needs it to do. It expanded our sales and\ncustomer base, enabling us to generate cash we need to reinvest. In the process, we've appropriately\nmanaged our operating expenses and have reduced the cost of running the business. This is criticallyTESLA, INC.

All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7important because I feel as though we've broken through a baseline fixed cost barrier enabled by the\nsuccess of the Model 3 business.\nWith continued focus on execution and cost management, the next 12 to 18 months should be the most\nexciting yet. During this time, we believe that Gigafactory Shanghai will be producing at scale. Model Y\nwill be in production, addressing the most popular vehicle segment. Our European Gigafactory will be well\nunderway. Our autonomous driving feature suite will continue to develop. Energy products business will\ngrow and maybe a few other things along the way.\nAnd while there's inherent risk in any large and ambitious set of projects, our intent is to grow and invest\nas fast as we can afford to. With the cash we have on hand and the stabilization of Model 3 across the key\nareas as I've noted, we believe we're in great shape for this next phase of growth.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you very much. Now let's start taking some first questions -- sorry about that. Sorry. Go ahead.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. So an important update is that J.B. Straubel, our Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer, will be\ntransitioning to a senior adviser from the CTO role. And Drew Baglino will be taking over most of J.B.'s\nresponsibilities. I'd like to thank J.B. for his fundamental role in creating and building Tesla. Thank you,\nJ.B.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nCTO & Senior Advisor\nThanks, Elon.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nIf we hadn't had lunch in 2003, Tesla wouldn't exist, basically.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nCTO & Senior Advisor\nIt's been -- yes, it's been quite an adventurous 16 years.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. Lunch with you and Harold Rosen [indiscernible]. That's the reason Tesla exists.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nCTO & Senior Advisor\nI remember it well. And maybe just to add a bit more to that. I'm not disappearing, and I just want to\nmake sure that people understand that this is not some lack of confidence in the company or the team or\nanything like that. I love the team and I love the company and I always will.\nSo Drew and I have worked closely together for many, many years, and I have total confidence in Drew.\nAnd I'm not going anywhere if there's anything I need to do to be helpful to Drew or the whole team or\nany of the ongoing projects. So yes, I mean I'm actually really happy with how we've kind of phased and\ntransitioned some of these different projects and people in, and I feel like this is a super-good process\noverall.\nIs there anything you want to say?\nDrew BaglinoTESLA, INC.

In fact, we've been talking\nabout this project back in 2003 all along and...\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYou guys talked back in 2003 as well?\nDrew Baglino\nFormer Vice President of Technology\nYes.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nWow. 2003 was a good year.\nDrew Baglino\nFormer Vice President of Technology\nI was graduating, and I didn't know what to do. I was like, oh, let's go do this project.

I think we'll go ahead with some questions now.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThank you very much. So we have some first questions from our retail shareholders from say.com.TESLA, INC. FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Question and Answer\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nAnd the first question is it has been stated that Tesla is supply constrained not demand constrained. Can\nyou help us shed some light on why Tesla is lowering car cost if supply is constrained?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nSure. There's a number of things to consider here. The -- there's really 2 key dimensions for demand.\nThere's value for money, and then there's affordability. Obviously, if somebody simply does not have\nenough money to buy the car, it doesn't matter how much the -- how good the value for money is. You\ncan have infinite value for money, but if someone does not have the funds to buy the car, they simply\ncan't get it. So it's very important to parse those 2, and I think there's like -- there's tremendous amount\nof desire to buy our cars, but people -- obviously, if they don't have enough money to buy them, they\ncannot. So we have to make the cars more affordable.\nAnd effectively back in the U.S., our cars got almost $2,000 more expensive with the expiry of the tax\ncredit on July 1 -- or the partial expiry. And we only dropped the price of the Standard Range Plus Model\n3 by $1,000 -- or actually -- yes, by $1,000. So the base Model 3 actually got $1,000 more expensive,\nwhich seemed like a reasonable compromise. So that's essentially what I mean. We feel like this is\nsometimes just have these sort of pretty absurd notions like if demand is high, you can't just charge any\nprice. Like you cannot charge any price. I think making our cars more affordable is also fundamentally\npart of the Tesla mission. So yes. Is there anything you want to add?\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, I'll just add to that. I agree completely. What I'll add is that, generally speaking, within the Model\n3 lineup, the pricing adjustments for our higher-churn cars was slightly more than that for the Standard\nPlus. So we'll see how the data plays out on this as we take in more orders, but the expectation is that\nour mix will move towards higher trim to some extent offsetting some of the ASP adjustments from the\npricing changes. And one other thing I'll add is that we are focusing on a couple of markets as well to\ntarget and to identify some of our sales, and so some of our pricing adjustments reflect those elements of\nthat strategy.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. Essentially, we expect average selling prices to be the same within a few percentage points.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nThat's correct.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nGenerally on ASP, as we noted in the letter, it was roughly, even over the course of the quarter, stabilized\naround $50,000. And we have good visibility into where our ASPs are going based on order data. And so\nthat gives us 1 to 2 months of lead as to where our actual recognized ASPs will be. And so I would expectTESLA, INC. FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11some adjustment to our Model 3 ASPs as a result of this pricing change, but the trim mix will offset some\nof that. And we continue to make great progress on cost efficiencies. And so overall in net, our expectation\nis that the Model 3 gross margin will continue to grow.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. On the gross margin point, like the full self-driving is just an extremely important part of the margin\ncalculation, and the features for full self-driving are -- only a portion of them have rolled out. So the\nrevenue recognition on the full self-driving option is limited at first until those features roll out. And also,\nthe demand for the full self-driving package is limited because the features are mostly prospective instead\nof current. But as those features roll out, I would expect the take rate for full self-driving to increase\nsignificantly as well as the recognition -- revenue recognition of full self-driving to obviously match the\nrollout of the product. So the gross margin over time will be really quite compelling when factoring in the\nfull self-driving option, which is, yes, accounted to $7,000 in mid-August. And that number will increase\nover time.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nThe second question is many of us who follow Tesla closely are incredibly excited about Battery and\nPowertrain Investor Day and its technology implications. Can you provide us any more detail on when this\nwill be and what will be covered?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes, I think for our Battery Day, we're going to do a comprehensive review of cell chemistry, module and\npack architecture and a manufacturing plan that has a clear road map to a terawatt hour per year. The\ntiming for this probably is about 6 months, like maybe February or March next year, show and tell.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nGreat. Thank you very much. The next question is you stated on the Q4 2018 earnings call that customer\nservice was a personal priority for 2019. Can you update us on what has been done to date to ensure that\nall owners are receiving an industry-leading customer experience?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nSure. I meet with the service team multiple times a week and get daily updates on the reliability of the\nvehicle. We -- the best service, of course, is no service. Like that's the vehicle just -- reliability and quality\nbeing so good that service is rarely required. That's what the main goal is like, eliminate the need for\nservice. Then in terms of increasing service resources, we're opening service centers as fast as we can\nand have already opened 25 new service locations this quarter, and that will increase -- the rate of service\ncenter opening will increase dramatically in through the course of this year as well as more Mobile Service.\nMobile Service is really great because it's like we just come to you and fix the car wherever you are. And\nit's hard to beat that for convenience. For parts delivery, we've made massive improvement to logistics for\ngetting parts to service centers. Hey, Jerome, do you want to -- Jerome is helping to manage the service\n-- global service and...\nJerome Guillen\nPresident of Automotive Division\nYes. As you pointed out, the best service is no service. So we're trying to continue improving the quality of\nthe cars. And we track this daily, and fewer and fewer service visits are required from the most recent cars\nthat we're building. So we're on a good trend there. We also need a lot fewer work to finish the cars in the\nfactory. Besides that, we stock way many more parts in all the service centers, and we ship everything\nsame day pretty much so that people don't have to wait for cars -- for parts. And we accelerate service,TESLA, INC. FQ2 2019 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 24, 2019\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12and we increase capacity. There's a lot of improvements that we've already implemented and many more\non the way. So I'm relatively optimistic, and I'm happy to help with the service team.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. They had the regional service heads in the U.S. at the factory last week, and it was incredibly helpful,\njust a closed loop on -- with service and production and with the software team. And for example, like a\nlot of service visits are just questions about how to use the car and...\nJerome Guillen\nPresident of Automotive Division\nAnd it's the #1 visit is how to use Autopilot. So yes, a bit of education there helps.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nLike literally how do I turn it on.\nJerome Guillen\nPresident of Automotive Division\nYes.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nLike it's -- yes. It's like how do I turn it on. Okay. So just providing better feedback on user interface and\nvirtually how do you turn it on. And yes, a whole bunch of things that are quite elementary to reduce\nservice load.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay. The next question is, in April, Gigafactory 1 had efficiency of about 23 out of the 35 gigawatt hours\ntheoretical capacity. Has this been improved yet? And is Tesla still cell constrained? Are there any near-\nterm plans to increase the plant theoretical capacity?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nDrew?\nDrew Baglino\nFormer Vice President of Technology\nWe have seen improvements in the 23 gigawatt hour number. We're in the high 20s now with the\ntrajectory continuing upward. We're not...\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nSo about 28-ish?\nDrew Baglino\nFormer Vice President of Technology\nYes, 28-ish. I would say we're not still constrained for any of our activities at the moment.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & DirectorTESLA, INC.

Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nGreat. Thank you very much. And the last question is what is the new Lathrop facility.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nNothing major. It's a parts distribution warehouse.\nJerome Guillen\nPresident of Automotive Division\nYes. We're optimizing the real estate, trying to consolidate everything under one roof, reduce the cost.\nThere's really nothing special there.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nOkay.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nI was wondering if you can comment about whether you felt that Q2 benefited from consumers in the U.S.\nsort of rushing out to buy Model 3s in advance of the declining federal tax credit, a phenomenon that you\nsort of saw in Q4. And part of the reason I ask is, at least by my analysis, it looks like maybe 70% of the\nModel 3s sold in the quarter were in the U.S., which is sort of higher than your normalized percentage\nof U.S. sales. And so do you feel that, that phenomenon may have occurred in Q2? And are you still\nconfident that Q3 deliveries can improve sequentially? And beyond the data point that you provided on the\ncall that the orders quarter data are better than last quarter. Is there anything else you can point to that\nprovides that confidence?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. I think we'll -- demand in Q3 will exceed Q2. It has thus far, and I think we'll see some acceleration\nof that. And then I think Q4 will be, I think, very strong. So we expect like quarter-over-quarter\nimprovements. I think Q1 next year will be tough. I think Q3 and 4 will be good. Q1 will be tough. Q2 will\nbe not as bad but still tough. And then I would say like Q3 and Q4 next year will be incredible.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. Just to add on the tax credit step-down, so the step-down from Q2 to Q3 was significantly lower\nthan the step-down from Q4 to Q1. It's also important to keep in mind that there's seasonality in the auto\nbusiness in Q1, which also is part of the impact. But generally speaking, our order rates so far this quarter\nis higher than where we were at this point in Q2, and we haven't seen a significant impact on U.S.-based\norders as a result of the step-down.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nOkay. If I could just follow up. Elon, I'm wondering if you can comment on whether you believe Model 3\nis having any cannibalization impact on S and X sales or why you think that -- or why else there might be\nsort of a structural step-down in the demand and delivery levels relative to what we've seen over the last\n5 or 6 years?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nActually, we were just talking about this earlier today. We're not quite sure ourselves. I think there's some\ncannibalization. In fact, there may be false expectation in the market that there's like some big overhaul\ncoming for S and X, which then cause people to hesitate to buy if they think there's some like radical\nredesign coming, which is why I've emphasized publicly that this is not the case. The Model S and X today\nare radically better than the ones that -- when we first started production, especially S, like I say, like\n2013 or 2012 Model S compared to today's Model S, night and day.

Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nZach?\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. On your question about the cadence of regulatory credits. It is -- generally, as I've commented in the\npast, we expect regulatory credits to become a more meaningful part of our business. On a quarter-to-\nquarter basis, it's very difficult to forecast them. As you saw from Q1 to Q2, that declined. And so as you\nmodel regulatory credits in Q3, I would not expect a significant increase in regulatory credits, although it's\nhard to forecast exactly.\nThe regulatory credits composition is a mixture of these particular deals that are onetime. There's also\nsome that are production-based over time. The production-based ones are easier to forecast because it's\nbased on cars that we build, and we get an offset to that way. The deal-specific ones are lumpier, which\nmakes it more difficult.\nAnd then your final question was on does it make sense to sacrifice pricing to drive regulatory credit in\ncertain markets. It might. I'm not sure if we've specifically gone into the details of that. But generally,\nwe're selling cars in markets at the prices we think are appropriate, and the regulatory credit is something\nthat traditional -- we generally try not to run the business based on regulatory credit revenue.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nThe regulatory credit is like -- I mean it's a relatively small part of the equation for Tesla. And the -- I\nthink the ZEV credit situation, I think really needs reform because the market for ZEV credits is negligible.\nNow some of what's happening here is the other manufacturers are kind of like waiting to see how their\nEV sales do before buying any credits from Tesla. And so it kind of depends on how that goes. If they sell\nmore EVs, then there's not really a need to do a deal with Tesla. And if they sell fewer, then there is.",

How should we be thinking about sustainable volumes\nand pricing on those volumes? Obviously, we're seeing some lower numbers here, and I think that's a core\nelement of what's going on with the story that as we see pricing drop and volumes drop, what are the\nright numbers to think about for you guys from a planning standpoint in terms of sell-through on both the\nModel S and Model X?\nElon R.

So like the main reason -- well, not the\nmain reason, but a reason is we want to keep spelling sexy. So that's -- not that I like -- that is a reason, I\nshould say, not the main reason to keep going with S and X.\nBut the story for Tesla future is fundamentally Model 3 and Model Y. And I think -- so like my guess is\nlike long-term sales of -- long-term meaning couple years type thing, the demand for -- sales demand\nfor 3 is like on order of 0.75 million units a year, and it's probably 1.25 million units a year for Model Y.\nSo combined, it's like maybe 2 million from those 2 vehicles alone. And then S/X is like maybe 80,000 to\n100,000 a year. So it's like 4% or 5% of the volume of 3 and Y.

So\nhow do you see your retail footprint evolving over time?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nAs I said, we opened 25 service locations. I think really what we find is that the word of mouth for Tesla is\nincredibly good. So once there's an increase of customers in a particular area, they love the cars and they\ntalk to all their friends about it. And that's really what drives sales. So if you think of like a retail location\nis kind of like a viral seed in an area. It would grow organically by itself, but the retail location is actually is\nlike a viral seed. It's not that -- they aren't needed. They're like an accelerant.\nBut what is needed for sales in any given area, and I'd say this worldwide, frequently we've been told like\nthis country is different or that country is different. I'm like people around the world pretty much want\nthe same thing so -- in my experience. But they have to have a service location that's convenient. So it\ncan't be like you've got to drive 5 hours to a service location. You have to have service. You have to have\nsupercharging and charging all sorted out. You've got to have good consumer financing. And then the\nprice must make sense. And any place where those 4 things are true, our sales are great. So we're rolling\nout service centers like crazy. Service centers are the key to sales, not the retail locations.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, and we're going city by city on the service center point. We're looking at where our populations are\nof existing customers. We're mapping driving time from the customers to the service centers inclusive\nof traffic to improve densification of our service centers in the locations in which our customers currently\nreside. We do have areas that are underrepresented for service centers where the drive time is too long or\nthere are populations don't have appropriate access to charging in the service centers.

So it's very systematically being mapped\nout with a focus on service and supercharging as opposed to a retail presence.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. Supercharging is incredibly important. You can't just have like 80% of the routes that somebody\nwants to take. You need 100% of the routes because a car is like -- it's really freedom to travel.

We expect to be able to offer full self-driving actually everywhere except EU because there's just\nsome committee rules that were put in place years ago that need to be changed. It's up -- from a\ntechnical standpoint, it's very doable, but we just need to work through the regulatory committees to get\nthe regulatory approvals and rules changed. It's just -- it all just takes a bit longer than in other places.\nBut I think we'll see a lot of pressure from our customers in Europe to have these rules changed so they\ncan have access to full self-driving. And I think at the end of the day, the regulators will answer to the\npublic. So I think it's just a temporary thing, and it's quite specific to EU rules. And we're just not present\nreally when those rules were drafted. So that's what's got put in place. But they're making a ton of sense,\nbut we just got to work through the process to change them.\nJoseph Robert Spak\nRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And then the second question is you mentioned service a number of times. There's obviously\nbeen some, I think, growing frustration with owners. And you mentioned parts availability, and you've\nissued the dealership model. But I guess how do you plan on increasing parts availability without the\ncorresponding working capital commitment that would be required as the fleet continues to grow?\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nIt's actually just taking the parts that were stored in a bunch of warehouses and just moving them to the\nservice centers. And the thing that makes sense is, I think, to have the service centers where the parts\nare kind of all on the wall, and it's like a supermarket. Like you always know where the Cocoa Puffs are,\nand you just go meet there and go to grab it. And then you just replenish the shelves with parts. And so\nwhat we're basically putting all parts that are used more frequently than like 6 weeks literally on the walls\nof the service centers. There's no ordering of the part. You just go take it off shelf and put it on the car.\nWe really want to get to not merely same-day service but same hour. Sort of like Jiffy Lube but applied\ngenerally to service.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. And specifically on the working capital piece of this, we actually have a significant amount of\nservice parts inventory. The challenge is it's not just at the service centers. And so a lot of the lag that is\nexperienced is we have to get the part from the distribution center to the service center. And so by moving\n-- by localizing the parts, I don't expect that to be a large working capital drain on the company. It might\nactually be the reverse where we don't need to store as many potentially.\nElon R. Musk\nFounder, CEO & Director\nYes. And also just having parts, if I may add, if we made them internally or if they're made at a supplier,\njust sending them directly to the service center instead of like having them go through a bunch of\ndistribution outlets. In fact, like when I was in China on my last trip, I was like asking the China team,\n\"Hey, is there anything silly that we're doing that we should fix?\" And they said, \"Yes, well, several of the\nparts that require replacement are literally made in China, and then we end up shipping them to New\nJersey and then back to China. And could we please just ship them like literally across the road?\" And I'm\nlike, yes, no problem. There's always like crazy things that happen, if you're like -- if you have a 45,000-\nperson company and then just kind of basically stop doing silly things. It's, yes, a lot of what is needed for\nimprovement.\nZachary Kirkhorn\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd as the scale of the business increases, the economics of localization of things like parts distribution\nmake a lot more sense, whereas in the past, when the company was smaller, having centralized centers\nwas easier from a cost perspective.
