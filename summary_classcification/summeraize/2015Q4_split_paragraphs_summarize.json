So I think the newsletter probably speaks for itself, but I'll add some commentary on some of the lead points. So obviously, we had a huge increase in Model S deliveries year-on-year in Q4 last year, going up 76%. We had a huge change in our core operational cash flow, which you can really see in the chart, and it's really quite dramatic. That's why I think it's interesting to look at in chart form. It goes from negative to significantly positive in Q4 last year. And then we made modest improvements in Model S gross margin, getting to about 25% excluding onetime items, and we feel pretty good about where we're tracking to probably get close to 30% by the -- by about Q4 this year.

I mean, it was -- the last several months have been quite excruciating, I'd say. I mean, many late nights and weekends, but I think we're through the worst of it at this point. Mike Ramsey Okay. And I had wanted to ask a little bit about also your plans for consolidation. And Dana asked about whether the Gigafactory could handle the Model 3. I'm curious. I haven't been there. There are so many folks working over there",

Dee-Ann Durbin Considering now that the Chevy Bolt is going to go on sale at the end of this year, so that'll be a full year that it's on sale before Model 3 arrives, does that -- I mean, has it taken any wind out of your sails? And -- or do you think, again, that these are very different customers? If you're comparing to an Audi A4, for example, are people still going to be attracted to the Model 3 even though they'll have that option on the market quite a while before the Model 3 arrives? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL FEB 10, 2016 Well, I mean, I would sort of point you to the market share of large luxury vehicles or large premium sedan sales in the U.S. that I talked about earlier in the call. We're currently outsell everyone in that category and had a 51% market growth last year where everyone else declined and the market as a whole declined. So I mean, if Model 3 is at all similar in its market segment,",

Are you guys noticing any slowdown in the pace of orders?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nJon, do you want to...\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales and Service\nYes, I think, Phil, it's a great question. And actually, the answer is no. The demand is very strong. We're\nup significantly over 2014 in the same period. And for both -- for S and X, we -- both the order rate on\nS and the conversion rate to orders on X has been very strong. And we're not seeing that impact at this\npoint in time across really all of our markets, both domestic and international.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. I mean, that said, we don't want to be complacent about demand generation. And as we mentioned,\nthere's a bunch of stores opening that -- in markets where we really haven't had a store or any kind of\nmeaningful store. I mean, our store in Manhattan, you basically need to be shown like almost to find it.\nSo unless you hunt us down, you won't find the store. I think we obviously need to change that and put\nstores where people are likely to encounter them, kind of like a fishing boat or something. It's like you just\ndon't -- you want to be where the fish are. It's like not in some sort of random barren location. So that's\nkind of what we're doing. So we're not complacent about demand. And just in case we see things take a\nturn for the worse, we want to overshoot on demand generation by our stores.\nJeff EvansonTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nVice President of Investor Relations\nAll right, everyone, that concludes the Q&A session of the call. Thank you so much for joining us today,\nand we look forward to seeing you all in the future.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. Thanks, everyone.",
