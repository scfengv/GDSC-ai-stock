Just a couple of points I want to hit on real quickly before we jump into Q&A. One is I just want to point out the prudent financial management that we've been able to accomplish over the last several quarters. An example here is back in 2015, we were spending $400 million a quarter on CapEx. We've averaged about $250 million a quarter in 2016. That will change as Model 3 starts to ramp up in Q4, but we are focusing on making sure that every dollar we spend is in its highest and best use. From a gross margin perspective, if you look at automotive gross margin, and it excludes credit revenue, we had a 140 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter. Lots of different factors there: one, obviously, the increase in volume helps on the labor and overhead front; second, our reliability continues to get better and better; a big change in Model X, over the last 12 months, as we highlighted in the letter; and continued improvements in batteries and drive units across both vehicles.

How should we think about that going into Q4? Does some of that unwind? Were there any changes to higher terms in the quarter? Or is that just this thing with the ramp in production? Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial Officer Sure, yes. Great questions, Jason. So yes, there was definitely an increase in payables and I think that will start to unwind a little bit in Q4, although this is natural. If you look at production, I believe it increased 37% quarter-over-quarter so there's naturally going to be more parts coming into the factory.
