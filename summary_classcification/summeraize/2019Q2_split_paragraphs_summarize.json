As a result of these accomplishments, we once again achieved strong free cash flows. We also successfully raised roughly $2.4 billion in net proceeds in May. We exited the quarter with $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, the highest in our history. Our net loss reduced significantly relative to Q1, aided by higher volumes in progress on cost efficiencies. We had a sequential reduction of $104 million related to regulatory credit, which is inherently lumpy. And in our other income line, we saw a $66 million reduction."

I know previously there was a target out there of 25% kind of on the S, X and Model 3. Just wondering, is the updated one, is that suggesting that that's no longer in play for the year? Or kind of what are the implications with today's update? Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director Well, if you factor in the full self-driving option, I think it is in play for the year. We just need to get the features done, make sure they're great, roll them out and recognize revenue and increase the take rate on full self-driving. But also for the existing fleet, there's a very significant opportunity to upgrade the existing fleet to full self-driving since most of the fleet has not purchased this option yet. So there's a significant margin potential for the existing fleet to upgrade to full self-driving, which most of the fleet can. So yes, absolutely, I think like, long term, we are talking 25%, 30%. Not -- long term meaning like a year. Long term",
