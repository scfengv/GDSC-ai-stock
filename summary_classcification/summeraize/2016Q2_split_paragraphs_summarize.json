I just want to make a few brief comments to add a little bit more color to the shareholder later. We're clearly disappointed with our delivery numbers but there's some underlying stories that we feel really good about, and I want to walk you through those. Automotive gross margin expanded this quarter. Automotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits grew from 20.1% in Q1 to 21.2% in Q2. A couple of different factors here. One was the Model S refresh. There was a modest price increase on the refresh but more importantly, we had baked the number of cost-downs into that vehicle before the launch. And then the second big factor is obviously X production. We've talked a lot about how we have come through the struggles on that and how we've managed to climb that production ramp, so that's looking great. On a go-forward basis, the way we're thinking about margins is we certainly see opportunities for continued cost-downs, both on the engineering front, also on the commercial front as well. We've got a supplier base that is very excited",

We started off the year, in December 31, 2015, we had $1.2 billion. We raised $1.7 billion in our secondary offering and we collected on our Model 3 reservations.
