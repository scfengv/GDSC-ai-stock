        "original_text": "Chunk 1: Before jumping into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect I think our letter says most of it, but I think we're going to spend extra time on Q&A, try to answer as many questions as possible. I think we should really answer -- so we're going to go as long as there are good questions to answer. The thing I'm most excited about is the rapid increase in output. We got -- just in the last 24 hours at Gigafactory managed to achieve a sustained rate of over 3,000 packs per day -- sorry, per week, and actually reached the peak hour with -- if extrapolated outward would be a rate of around 5,000 cars per week. And obviously, you can't take a peak hour and assume every peak is -- every hour is as good as the peak. But it's -- if you can -- if you're going to achieve it even once in an hour, then with continued refinement of the system and improved operational uptime of the machinery, it means that you can achieve that sustained rate with more refinement. So if we spend essentially a month or 2 improving the operational uptime and the system as a whole, we'll be able to do well over 5,000, I think. I mean, what's interesting is that, at least in the case of pack production, we were able to do this with minimal CapEx. And I think, in general, our understanding of production is improving dramatically -- exponentially, in fact, and we are seeing ways to achieve improved volume with dramatically less CapEx by simplifying the production line, by really engaging with our associates, no matter how junior, and improving the way that parts are made. It's amazing how everybody's got good ideas. Just need to solicit those ideas and implement them and then making ongoing design improvements so that when we discover that something is not well designed for manufacturing, that we will very quickly change that part design and introduce that into the flow. One of the things we also found is that there are some things that are very well suited to manual operation and some things that are very well suited to automated operation, and the 2 should not be confused. So I should be clear that the vast majority of the Tesla production system is automated. However, as I mentioned in a tweet a few months ago, we did go too far in the automation front and automated some pretty silly things. One example would be we have this -- so this is sort of ironically foolish. We had these fiberglass mats on the top of the battery pack, but basically like -- they're basically fluff. So we tried to automate the placement and bonding of fluff to the top of the battery pack, which is ridiculous. Like so we had fluffer bot, which was really an incredibly difficult machine to make work.TESLA, INC.",

All Rights reserved. spglobal.com/marketintelligence 5Machines are not good at picking up pieces of fluff, okay. Human hands are way better at doing that. And so we had a super complicated machine using a vision system to try to put a piece of fluff on the battery pack. That same -- and one of the questions asked was, \"Do we actually need that?\" So we tested a car with and without and found that there was no change in the noise volume in the cabin, so we actually had a part that was unnecessary that was -- of course, the line kept breaking down because fluffer bot would frequently just fail to pick up the fluff or put it in like a random location. So that was one of the silliest things I found. We were also -- and this still remains to be fixed, but -- in a lot of cases, but we're overgeneralizing the design. So for example, the current battery pack has a port for the front-drive units, which we then put a blanking plate, a sealed blanking plate on. So essentially, we punched a hole in it and put a blanking plate at the hole and do that for all rear-drive unit cars, which is kind of crazy. We've added cost. We've added a manufacturing step, better failure mode, and for something that is unnecessary. So that is something that's -- or example of some things. That's changed. So -- and then result is we've had a radical improvement in production -- battery pack production went from taking 7 hours to make a pack 3 weeks ago to under [ 70 ] minutes now, so just to show that it's like really radical improvement. It's R&D possible. We also saw a modest improvement in Zone 4 of module production. This, I should point out, is a clearly automated zone, and we're able to also achieve a sustained rate of 3,000 vehicles a week. So we're actually slightly ahead in battery module and pack production than expected. And with some work at the Fremont vehicle plant, primarily in the general assemble -- general assembly area, I'm confident we will very soon exceed the 3,000 mark in Fremont.",

        "original_text": "Chunk 1: Our first question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Arthur Johnson Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division Yes. Want to talk a little bit about some of the -- first of all, if we talk about the -- sort of all relate to the production ramp. If we talk about the 5,000 per week run rate, is that assuming 7/24 ? Or at what point do you think you'd get to sort of 5-day, 2-shift operation? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Well, first of all, I think a 5-day, 2-shift operation is a ridiculous way to operate because that would be a very poor use of CapEx. Nor is it the way that we have operated in -- for most of Tesla. So the module production -- the cell module and battery pack production and powertrain production have always operated on a 24/7 basis. And the exception has been general assembly, which has operated on typically 2 to 3 shifts, so about a 5- to 6-day, 20-hour shift; and paint, which has operated on kind of a 6-day basis. So I think it just makes sense to operate the whole company on the same basis, but a majority of Tesla is always operated -- a majority of Tesla production has operated around 24/7 basis since we started production. Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer Yes. And this is J.B. I can chime in. As Elon said, it really makes great use of the CapEx and the lines, and that's why we did it, starting way back at the beginning of S. But aligning everything to the same shift schedule makes it so much more efficient because we don't have the seesaw of inventory, the underlying inventory between the different shops. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Exactly. And one of the key things to improving the capital efficiency of the system is reducing work in progress -- work in process. And if you don't have -- if the shifts are not aligned, then you have to build up inventory in kind of a storage warehouse and then -- yes. So it's pretty foolish to actually operate on a 5-day, 2-shift in any way. But it's -- this is sort of a -- we're using the chip fab approach to capital efficiency, so it's called [indiscernible]. I don't know where it says what. I'm not sure what it's called. But like this is something called... Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer Ultimate workweek. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Ultimate work whatever, ultimate workweek. Yes.

Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect It's not like one person working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There are like 4 or 5 shifts. Brian Arthur Johnson Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division Yes. So if I just do the math, that would seem like 5,000 to get you to takt time of 2 minutes. And I go back to some of the prior conversations, I mean, that's -- my understanding is best in class is sort of 50 seconds to a minute. And I thought the whole going faster than grandma walker was actually targeted at blowing past that, but sounds like you're sort of 2x the takt time of other factories. Elon R.

Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Let's say it could take us a minute then, because that would mean it's like over a 7-day, 24-hour workweek. Like we could also just say -- actually we did our peak pack production today was 32 packs in an hour, so we're under a minute -- under 2 minutes a pack and rising from there. Jeffrey B.

        "original_text": "Chunk 1: Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Avraham Lache Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Just wanted to follow along on that line of question. So to the extent that you're adding humans in certain automated processes, can you just help us interpret the extent to which these changes affect the economics on Model 3? And to the extent that you've done some competitive analysis, all of these efforts in the Tesla production system, how do you stack up competitively against other OEMs in terms of labor hours per vehicle or depreciation per vehicle? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Well, I'll just say something -- so a few things, then I have -- Deepak can elaborate. Let's see. So the thing that I've noticed is, if you have a really complicated machine like the fluff bot that I was talking about earlier, in order to keep it operating, you have to have a ton of maintenance engineering. So you have like basically pretty expensive maintenance engineers that have to maintain the thing and fix it, like, basically 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. The cost of the maintenance engineer may not be incorporated directly into -- or fully incorporated directly into gross margin, but it's nonetheless a cost that far exceeds the labor cost of simply placing the fluff on the battery pack, which, as I said, that was unnecessary. So I think to actually -- I do not see this having a much of a long-term impact in our cost. I actually see it most likely our cost will decrease, or we consider the cost to producing the vehicles will decrease by getting rid of production stations that are really poorly suited to robotics because of the very expensive cost of robot technicians. Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer Rod, we are very CapEx efficient, or let me just start from that point. And if we look at our depreciation cost on a per-unit basis at steady run rate of 5,000 or so cars per week, we are, in my mind, well below a lot of our -- I mean, most of our competitors, well below $2,000 per unit depreciation cost. And then overall, clearly there is some impact, as we have indicated in the letter, from the additional labor we'veTESLA, INC.

And our expectation fully is a lot of this labor will come out once we stabilize production and then figure out smart ways of automating where it makes sense.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division I just wanted to follow up on the previous question and the gross margin targets. I think you had said last quarter that once you got to 5,000 units, you felt that you could get to 25% gross margins on Model 3, so that feels like at least a 6- or 9-month delay relative to what you thought a quarter ago. And I'm trying to understand what the key drivers are. Is it really the labor for capital substitution? I don't think currency sequentially has changed much. I understand it can be a headwind. But I think relative to when you made those statements, it hasn't changed. So perhaps you can help us understand what has changed in terms of the gross margin ramp for Model 3 relative to what you thought before. And I have a follow-up, please. Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer Yes, it's along the lines of what we said in the letter. If we look at the combination of the recently imposed tariffs, Section 232 and countervailing duties plus commodity price increases as well as the weaker dollar, that is adding significant material cost. And then temporarily, we are using more labor. So when you combine those 2, that's what led to our guidance. And certainly, the material -- the labor cost piece, we will address and that will come out. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Yes. But I mean, we're only talking about a 3% to 5% difference.

Galileo Russell To represent retail investors, I was wondering with Waymo's plans to launch an autonomous taxi service in limited markets this year if you could give us an update on the Tesla Network and any details surrounding the launch date or geographic rollout. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Sure. So I mean, that's -- thank you for an interesting question. The launch involve -- where things are obviously going towards is a shared electric autonomy model. So the -- in order for this to -- obviously for the whole sort of system to work, you need all the pieces in place. You need to have full autonomy, full 4 or 5, whatever you want to call it, and obviously a lot of cars in the road and then build the software infrastructure behind that to enable shared autonomy, so to help enable people to share their cars and be able to offer their cars as effectively kind of a robo Lyft or robo Uber. It's sort of like a combination of like, I guess, Uber, Lyft and Airbnb type of thing, where you can own your car and have a higher percent usage of an autonomous electric car. You can say it's available generally to anyone who wants to use it when you're not using it. You can recall it at will. You can restrict usage to only friends and family or only users who are 5-star. Like this is like the obvious thing that's going to happen. But in order for that to be in place, we have to obviously sell full autonomy, and we're making a really good progress on that front. I believe that the current production of -- the vehicles that we are currently producing are capable of full autonomy, but the only thing that would really be, like, might be needed or maybe is probably needed is a computer upgrade to have more processing power for the vision neural net. But that's a plug-in replacement, a thing that can be done quite easily.

And how many do you read about? Basically none of them. However -- and but if it's an autonomous situation, you -- it's headline news. And the media fails to mention that, actually, they shouldn't really be writing the story. They should be writing a story about how autonomous cars are really safe, but that's not the story if you want a click on, so they write inflammatory headlines that are fundamentally misleading to the readers. It's really outrageous. So -- and this would be true like even if electric cars were -- I'm sorry, if autonomous cars were 10x safer. So instead of 1 million deaths, you have 100,000 deaths, there's still going to be people who will still sue and say, \"Hey, you're responsible for the death here.\" And it's like, well, the 90% of people who didn't die are not suing. They're not -- they're still alive. You just don't know it, so you -- we've got to deal with that. And then obviously regulators respond to public pressure and the press. So if the press is hounding the regulators, and the public is laboring on misapprehension that autonomy is less safe because of that -- of misleading press, then this is where I find the things to -- the challenge of predicting it to be very difficult.

Or is there some sort of new breakthrough or different platform that the Semi and Roadster are going to be built on? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Like even if we didn't -- I mean, even if we didn't improve our battery technology at all, we could achieve a 500-mile range truck. At all. We're going to do better than 500 miles. Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer Yes. This is J.B. I think the key point is it doesn't require some dramatic breakthrough that -- so there's a fundamental misunderstanding, I think, of what the current technology in our existing products can actually do. And maybe that's just a misunderstanding of the current status of the technology versus others in the industry. That could be where some of that's coming from. If they're benchmarking sort of the best battery pack they can buy from a supplier and then mapping that with what the Semi could do, it doesn't give you -- it doesn't solve.

The thing about a 350-kilowatt charger is it doesn't actually make a ton of sense unless you've got a monster battery pack or have like a crazy high C-rate, in which case your energy density is going to be poor. So it's kind of cockamamie. Yes, I think maybe 200 -- on a -- also I don't know if you meant 350 kilowatts for a single car.

And some of it also comes down to an optimization around utility versus cost and trade-offs in the car itself. You kind of hinted at that, Elon, but there is a trade-off fundamentally between charge speed and essentially range or cost of battery. And we look at that pretty carefully. We understand the trade-off, and we could design cells in the pack that could charge it faster than 300, 400 kilowatts. But it's not a very useful trade-off to the customer. That's... Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Let's go to understand the difference between energy and power even, really. Energy -- obviously, energy's rate is essentially, at most, a range. And then power is kind of like your peak acceleration basically, the rate at which you consume energy. So really what -- it's more important to have long range than it is to have a superfast charge time. And you can sort of think about this in the devices that you use.

Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect We've always said that we're -- this is not intended to be a walled garden, and we're happy to support other automakers and let them use our Supercharger stations. They would just need to pay the share of the cost proportionate to their vehicle usage. And they would need to be able to accept our charge rate or at least -- and our connector, at least have an adaptor to our connector. So this is something we're very open to, but so far none of the other car makers have wanted to do this. But it's like not because of opposition from us. This is not a walled garden.

Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Sorry. Can you repeat the question?

But like if your only defense against like invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. What matters is the pace of innovation. That is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness. And for any given company, if the rate of innovation -- let's say, like our competitors, maybe they're -- they come out with something near every 6 years. We're maybe every 2 to 3 years. So if our innovation is, let's say, twice that of any given competitor, then it is simply -- this is true of, generally, of companies in any industry.

So I'm wondering what the philosophy is there. Is it also you're going offer that at cost and reduce that energy price? Or are you thinking of that as a revenue stream for the company? Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer We haven't really talked about any of that and haven't finalized, frankly, any of that. It's -- we want to make sure that there's a very seamless and easy system to operate trucks wherever they need to go. And some customers may elect to work with us on the whole system or parts of it. But I think there's a lot of different ways that, that can be solved. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Yes. I mean, for sure, with commercial trucking like a heavy-duty Semi, economics are fundamental to that situation. We're not making decisions based on aesthetics or consumer-related things. We're -- like we made our -- we're trying to make our Semi kind of cool and sexy just because we think that that's a good thing to do, not because it affects the buying decision of our customers in a meaningful way. It doesn't really move the needle. I mean, there was like a laughable lawsuit recently from some company ironically called Nikola. It's like Nikola is suing Tesla. That's hilarious. Fate loves the irony. And -- but they're like suing us because of the way the trucks look, which is absurd. Nobody's buying a Semi truck because of the way it looks or because it's got like a wraparound windshield or whatever, please. So the economics are incredibly important. And so we have to make sure that the Superchargers or Megachargers, whatever you call them, or the trucks are set up in a way that you'd have very low cost of electricity. Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer I mean, one maybe slightly related point to that, that I think is super exciting about this is the potential to link up renewable energy generation at a very fixed and also very affordable cost to power future trucking fleets. Ultimately, that can give customers an incredibly deterministic cost per mile that will not change with the price of petroleum over decades, which is really, really an interesting proposition for a trucking customer. And that's something that we're pretty excited about. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Yes, exactly. It's really worth emphasizing that.

And fundamentally, it's like what is the cost per mile kilometer of cargo? And that drives the commercial trucking market. You can have the ugliest truck in the world and it still would be victorious. Galileo Russell Yes. And building on that, do you have any thoughts on how the trucking market could change or potentially grow if you guys are actually able to deliver on dramatic cost reduction, especially with things like platooning? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect I think it will take away quite a bit of revenue from railway because the reason rail's heavily competitive is it's effectively just platooning with lots of railcars. And you need only a small crew to operate the train. However, trains don't go everywhere. So you have to like have a truck to deliver things to the train rail spur and then pick stuff -- pick it up. And then at the destination, the truck's got to pick it up from the rail spur over there. So you still have trucks plus train plus transfer. So I think platooning of trucks will quite dramatically affect the rail industry in a negative way. Galileo Russell Okay. Last one, I promise. On Tesla Energy, I assume that you guys are basically supply constrained, not demand constrained on that side of the business.

And in particular, how has this successful project in South Australia sort of changed the industry's perception of what batteries can do? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Yes, I think it's had quite a profound effect. The -- there's -- South Australia took a chance on doing the world's biggest battery. That's worked out really well. If you read the articles, it's worked out far beyond their expectations because the battery's able to respond at the millisecond level, far faster than any hydrocarbon plant. And so it's value and good stabilization is much greater actually than even a gas turbine plant, which can normally respond quite fast. So it's kind of like you get in a Tesla and you can -- you have that instant acceleration. Feels like you like have -- also like a mind meld with the car. It's just like the car is you. And then that same rapid response is true of the battery pack. So the customers that -- the utilities that worked with us thus far have really loved the battery pack. And I feel confident that we'll be able to announce a deal at the gigawatt-hour scale within a matter of months. So it's a 1,000 gigawatts -- megawatt-hours -- 1,000 megawatt-hours",

And we're trying to do our best to prioritize customers between residential Powerwall and utility and commercial. I'd say our longer-term strategy is to shift a little bit of our focus and really catch up on our Powerwall demand backlog, which is quite -- it's too long right now. We know people are waiting too long. So that's -- I think that's generally the direction we're trying to take that.

Can you give us some perspective in terms of how many reservations you guys have now, and where you guys are in the plan for developing it and rolling out the first model? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect My apologies, sorry. We're just discussing something internally. Could you repeat that question? Phil Lebeau With the Tesla Semi, how many reservations do you guys now have approximately? And where are you in the process as far as the development and the rollout of the first model in terms of time line when you guys expect that to happen, et cetera? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect I actually don't know how many reservations we have for the Semi. I don't think... Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer About 2,000. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect About 2,000? Okay. I mean, we haven't really tried to sell the Semi. It's not like there's like an ongoing sales effort. So sales orders are -- for the Semi are like opportunistic, more like companies approaching us. It's just not something we really think about much. Our focus is on the Model 3. We need to get that to above 5,000 a week at a good margin. We need to become a profitable company. That is a good criticism that has been leveled at Tesla, an accurate one. It's high time we became profitable. And the truth is like you're not a real company until you are, frankly. So that's our focus right now. And then -- so we've got an awesome product road map. The Tesla Semi is one of those things. And I think we've got a really good idea for the -- the Model Y is going to be amazing. I'm really excited about that. Tesla pickup's going to be great. So the product road map -- I mean, we have like way more cool things than we know what to do. Like the idea is -- idea generation part to devoted to execute it. So we just need to stay focused and not divide our attention on too many products at one time. Phil Lebeau And a follow-up. When -- given the fact that you're already packed to the gills in Fremont, when will you make a decision regarding a second manufacturing facility? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect So the -- that's probably later this year. It has to be later this year. So I'm not sure of the exact time, but I don't know, maybe next quarter but not later than fourth quarter for Model Y. And then we also expect to announce the location of the Tesla Gigafactory in China soon. Phil Lebeau And",

James Joseph Albertine Consumer Edge Research, LLC And if I can be brief, I wanted to ask, given the coverage that you've received as it relates to these high- profile accidents, one of the things we like most about your company is you have the most miles tested and continue to test daily from an Autopilot perspective. Can you give us any color from what you're seeing in your data as it relates to the confidence that your consumers have in the Autopilot functionality, whether they've used it more or less frequently in their existing vehicles or whether they've opted to purchase the functionality more or less in lieu of these accidents? Because we're really trying to get ahead a sense of consumer sort of -- the ability or the likelihood of consumers to adopt this technology over time. So this would be very helpful. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect We do see a steady increase in the number of percentage of miles driven with using Autopilot. As we roll out more functionality, as we make it better, we see a steady increase. I think it's something -- for cars equipped with Autopilot, something on the order of 1/3 of highway miles, maybe closer -- maybe 1/2 in some cases are -- in some regions are on Autopilot. But then, of course, when there's like negative news in the press, then that dips. And then I was like, \"Okay, this is not good because people are reading things in the press that cause them to use Autopilot less, and then that makes it dangerous for our customers and that's not cool.\" That's why I get upset. And then we get accused of blaming the victim. I was like, \"Look, we're not blaming the victim here, but it is important that people not be under the wrong impression.\" The statistics are unequivocal that Autopilots improve safety. No question. In fact, one thing I was going to mention, forgot to but also going to mention, is that we'll be publishing our safety statistics on a quarterly basis so people know exactly what Autopilot safety is. Is it getting better? Is it getting worse? And it's like, look, coloring those impressions is that when there is a serious accident on Autopilot, people, for some reason, think that -- or some of the articles think that it's because the driver thought the car was fully autonomous and it wasn't, and we somehow misled them into thinking it was fully autonomous. It is the opposite case. When there is a serious accident, it is almost always, in fact, maybe always the case that it is an experienced user. And the issue is what -- more one ofTESLA, INC.

And I don't want to ask a mundane question, so -- but I think it's important because one of your stakeholders are shareholders right now. And so far, we've had a couple pushouts in production. And is there a way that you can update us when you get to that 3,000 number or 4,000 number per week? I mean, you -- you're active on Twitter. Can you just let us know? Because -- we're going to have a big vacuum here and there's a lot of news flow out there that makes volatility into the stock. It makes it hard for people to own even though you have a lot of believers out there. And so even though it would be in my office right now, I think it's very important to get those kind of updates. And so that's -- I think that's my question. Can you give us an update when you get to 3,000 and 4,000 per week on the Model 3? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Yes. Actually, the -- what's -- Tesla's such a leaky server of information that I think the news will leak pretty quickly. Also people track registrations very closely. So at most, any information that we provide would be 1 week or 2 in advance of what will become public knowledge just due to vehicle registrations and shipments that are tracked very carefully. So that really, the problem is like people get too focused on like what's happening in the space of a few weeks or a few months.
