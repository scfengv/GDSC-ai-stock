Firstly, we just kicked off the program in April, so it's actually been pretty heartening to see how it's done so far. And to keep it at a high level, we're actually selling these cars at a faster rate than we are getting these trade-ins to come in. So as this program picks up, it's going to really be a successful program, and it's creating good demand for us on the pre-owned side. Elon R.

It doesn't really sound like this is related at all to the backlog of orders from Model S. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect Correct. I mean, we do think that it's going to be quite a challenging production ramp on the X. And if we are faced with a choice of -- to deliver a great -- we only want to deliver great cars. So we don't want to drive to a number that's greater than our ability to deliver high-quality vehicles.

There are actually -- it's a little bit more complicated than that because there are parts of the factory that are much more automated than other parts.

Does that just simplistically mean that you're targeting the mix to be roughly 50-50 between X and S right from the get-go in 2016? It does. Although it's -- I wouldn't put too much precision on that because what we're going to try to do is to push the production slightly more in the direction of X because people have been waiting for a long time for their cars. But it is difficult for us to say exactly what the S, X demand ratio will be until the car is out there and people are experiencing it and we see what the relative order volume is. But we have so many so many Model Xs and Ss. If you look at worldwide demand for SUVs and sedans, it's almost dead even at 50- 50."
