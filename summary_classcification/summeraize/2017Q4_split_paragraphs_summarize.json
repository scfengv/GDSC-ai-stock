So 2017 was also a big year for Tesla. We launched the Model 3, which was our first mass production vehicle, and it's a huge step change for Tesla. A lot of challenges but I think we made tremendous progress on that front. We also designed and installed and got into operation the world's largest battery in Australia, the largest battery by a significant margin. And that battery is exceeding its performance targets significantly. We also unveiled the Tesla Semi, which is a super heavy-duty truck, maximum load semi truck, and the next-gen Roadster, which we believe will exceed gasoline sports cars on every dimension. And we also achieved record production and deliveries of Model S and X. And overall, I think, while there were challenges associated with Model 3 ramp at the -- we were in a deeper level of hell than we expected. So a few levels deeper than we'd like to be but swiftly exiting, I think. And so it's really, I think, on balance, a phenomenal year. And I'd like",

Maybe if you can just provide us with a little bit more color on where the challenges are at this point?
