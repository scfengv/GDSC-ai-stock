Here's what those fools don't realize. If Tesla is not alone in the car industry that -- all those things would be material if we were the only car company in existence. We are not. There are many car companies. What matters is whether we have a relative advantage in the market. And in fact, the incentives give us a relative disadvantage.

They're making it up in carb credits. But they get the full retail value of the carb credit whereas we get the wholesale value when we're lucky. But the carb credits only -- are only effective at a production rate of about 20,000 to 30,000 vehicles a year. So that's why you'll see, mark my words, it's not going to be any higher than that for the Chevy Volt. That's the 25,000 -- on the order of 25,000 units a year or 1/10th of our initial production rate for the Model 3 or 1/20th of what the Model 3 will be next year. So Tesla's competitive advantage improves as the incentives go away. This is -- it continues to be something that is not well understood. And for that they don't -- I'll also mention that -- the Nevada tax credits, which for the Gigafactory, it makes it sound like we got a $1.3 billion check from the state of Nevada. We did not.

By our math, if you look at the cumulative number of vehicles you've\ndelivered and the amount of stores and service stations, it's a little bit over -- or something around 700\nper I guess station. And I realize you're adding some more of these mobile units. But I just wanted to\nknow bigger picture how you think about coverage in the more steady state or at least at 0.5 million unit\nrate. Like, what is the right level of coverage needed for the larger fleet?\nJeffrey B. StraubelTESLA, INC. FQ1 2017 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 03, 2017\nChief Technology Officer\nI think, rather than thinking about store or service center locations, we think about it in terms of mobile\nunits and lifts. And so we are building larger service centers over time that have more lifts. So our initial\nservice centers, it might have had 2 or 3 lifts. And we're building now service centers with 40 to 60,\nsometimes 80 lifts. And so there's a density within the service centers. But the mobile capability expands\nthat quite greatly. So I think a lot of people do incorrect analysis to take cars in service divided by\nlocations, because the locations varies so widely. But that's essentially how we're thinking about capacity\nand planning capacity. And as Deepak mentioned earlier, our throughputs and efficiency are getting much\nbetter over time, and we'll continue to improve those. So it's our goal to stay ahead of the installed base\ncapacity so we're providing great service. But really the Model 3 has been designed for high reliability. And\nas Elon has said many times, the best service is no service at all.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nExactly. We're -- our aspiration would be we make 0 service revenue because the car never needs -- never\nbreaks.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nAbsolutely.
