On Monday, we hosted our first-ever Autonomy Investor Day, showcasing our new in- house designed full self-driving computer and our AI-based software trained by more than 400,000 Tesla vehicles. All Tesla cars being built today have all the hardware necessary for full self-driving, and over the year updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income which, as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago, we think is somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 a year, in some cases, perhaps more. We're the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for full self-driving. We're in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.

On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter. This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarter and then U.S. local builds in the second half. This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations.

Joseph Robert Spak RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division First question is really just a clarification on -- in the outlook of 25% non-GAAP gross margin that you're targeting. Is that over the mid-term? Or is that something you expect to hit by the end of this year? And if so, what gets S and X back higher given the price cuts? Zachary Kirkhorn Chief Financial Officer Yes, this is Zach here. That guidance that we're targeting for the end of the year. Although internally, we're working towards S and X non-GAAP gross margin achieving that sooner. The biggest lever there is actually 2 components. One is, as we increase volume back on our S and X production line, there's just a natural benefit there from the fixed cost absorption which will help us. But we also have a number of cost reduction projects in place that we're executing on over the course of the year. And then the third piece which applies to S and X, but also Model 3, we're seeing an increased take rate on our full self-driving offering. And there are revenue deferrals associated with",

Colin Langan UBS Investment Bank, Research Division I mean, it sounds like from the tone of the call that you don't see that there's a demand issue for some of the product, but margins seem to be under pressure and typically automakers stop pricing when there is a demand issue. So what is the logic of the price cuts during the quarter? Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect I mean, our goal, as we've been very clear about from beginning of the company, is to make our cars as affordable as possible. And we thought it was important to offer the $35,000 Model 3 and then to create a sort of bundled package for the Model 3 with the increased range because we think actually that difference between 220 and 240 is quite important, the more point people realize in range and having a posher premium interior and then finally, Autopilot. So we thought those -- [ like we went and paired like ] product that's really just nailed the sweet spot, which I think the $39,000 -- $39,500 Model 3 is just really nailed the sweet spot",
