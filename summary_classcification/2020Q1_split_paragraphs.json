I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ1 results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Paci\ufb01c Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent \ufb01lings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the \ufb01nal few weeks.This is the \ufb01rst time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak \ufb01rst quarter.Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatorycredits, while ramping 2 major products. What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviouslylearned a lot here. After all -- after the Model 3 ramp from 3 years ago, our new products get"

Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster thanthe Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1. Most surprisingly is, otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule thatwe were ahead of already. Most surprisingly -- Model Y was pro\ufb01table already in its \ufb01rst quarter ofproduction, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traf\ufb01c lights and stop signs to earlyaccess users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week. Ourcars will now automatically stop at each stop sign or traf\ufb01c lights until the driver gets acon\ufb01rmation to proceed. I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but weare only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel that it is probably asafety improvement. We are collecting data from over 1 million intersections every month at thispoint. This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people startdriving again. Soon, we will be collecting data from"

It's thereason I'd say it's very dif\ufb01cult to have a search engine that competes with Google becauseeveryone is training Google all the time with their searches. So when you search something, andyou click on a link, you're training Google every time you do that. It's just very dif\ufb01cult for any newsearch engine to compete on that basis.So all those con\ufb01rmations are training on neural net, and soon cars will be able to drive through anintersection without a con\ufb01rmation as well as to make turns.

So the car -- and they did this overnight. And sothe car actually went into waiting-for-driver mode and lost 2% of its range and, as a result, had a391 test. As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we're actually con\ufb01dentthat we will achieve a 400-mile or greater range with the Model S.

I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla teamthis past quarter. A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned. We successfullylaunched, ramped and demonstrated pro\ufb01tability of the Model Y , as Elon mentioned, signi\ufb01cantlyahead of schedule. This is our second large-scale product launch since Model 3 in 2017, and it'sevidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp ef\ufb01ciency. It's hard to understate thesigni\ufb01cance of demonstrating pro\ufb01tability of this program in its \ufb01rst quarter of production.Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents ofModel 3s built in Fremont. This is despite not yet running at full capacity while also managingthrough the production shutdown in early February. We also announced a long-range andperformance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China.On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of governmentincentives at the end of Q4.

We also experienced expected launchinef\ufb01ciencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted overallpro\ufb01tability.As I've noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which are credits we sell to other carmakers,to generally increase with time. This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4. And notethat most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it's re\ufb02ected in the accountsreceivable on the balance sheet.Our free cash \ufb02ows were impacted by the temporary increase in end-of-quarter inventory for all ourproducts resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.

        "paragraph": "Thank you very much. So we'll take the \ufb01rst questions from institutional investors compiled by SayTechnologies. The \ufb01rst question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet topurchase or experience FSD despite most vehicles having all the necessary hardware. What leverscould you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage? For example, could youconsider offering FSD as a premium subscription?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards theend of this year. I should say it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as, in our view, buyingFSD is an investment in the future. And we are con\ufb01dent that it is an investment that will pay off tothe consumer and to the bene\ufb01t of the consumer. In my opinion, buying FSD option is somethingpeople will not regret doing.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOI agree. And \ufb01nancially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in thevehicle or a lease is -- will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preservethe option value of increased value of time. But we do understand that some customers who haveownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront. And so this will enablethose customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely. As you may be like, at a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area underthe curve of customer happiness. That is our goal. And we think that that's the kind of thing that allcompanies should try to do. And it's what results in long-term value creation. And loyalty begetsloyalty. So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we're con\ufb01dent thatif we behave like that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us."

        "paragraph": "Thank you. The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEVsubsidy program that disquali\ufb01es Tesla vehicles from bene\ufb01ting from the subsidies. To what extentis there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer sothey can qualify for the subsidy?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production cost in China. And we're actuallyexcited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3basically tomorrow, China time. So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, Chinatime. And that will be a price below the subsidy limit. And we feel con\ufb01dent that, that will still be avehicle that delivers a good gross margin.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced inShanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's stillsigni\ufb01cant opportunity left to take cost out. So our \ufb01xed cost absorption from higher productionvolumes, which are occurring in Q2, will occur through the rest of the year. We're not fullylocalized on the supply chain yet. And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it's notcomplete, and there's additional opportunities there. And so we'll continue to bring the price downand expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this reduction in price that Elonmentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle."

In which way has Tesla improved or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-19?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more ef\ufb01cient as a company.That's -- one always has to do that in a crisis. And just thinking about our core beliefs and what dowe want to do, and we came to a conclusion that the right move is actually to continue to expandrapidly, continue to invest in the future and in new technologies, even though it is risky. And we'vetalked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well. So I think that there'sclearly an uncertain future ahead. It's a bit of a bumpy road. But I think the long-term prospects areextremely good. Anything you guys want to add?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, I agree with that, Elon.

We want to -- leave theexciting news for that day, but there will be a lot of exciting news to tell. And I think it would beone of the most exciting days in Tesla's history. And we're just trying to \ufb01gure out the right timingfor that. We think probably the right timing will be the -- probably the third week of May.

        "paragraph": "Okay. And the last question from institutional investors, could you please update on progresstowards development and commercialization of Full Self-Driving? How much revenue have yourecognized so far?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSo there's a couple of things on the \ufb01nancials for Full Self-Driving. So currently, in North America,it's sold for $7,000 as an option. We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of itgoes into deferred revenue. That's associated with features that will be released with time. Ourdeferred revenue balance is continuing to grow. It's a little bit over $600 million. And so as werelease features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have beenreleased, the associated value, and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into our\ufb01nancials for that quarter. And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we canrecognize that revenue. So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenuewithin period. So I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful grossmargin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorAbsolutely. There's also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the \ufb02eet out there that couldupgrade to turn on Autopilot -- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving. And that's something that wewill enable just as simple in-app purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the end of theyear, as a subscription. So that's just a lot of untapped potential there. That's not in the deferredrevenue line, obviously, but is -- which is certainly a great deal of deferred potential that we think is-- a large portion of which is likely to reach fruition."

Is this still in line withTesla's ambitions for the next 5 to 10 years? This would be 4 million vehicles in 2025 and morethan 20 million vehicles in 2030. Is 40% a more realistic target?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it's always dif\ufb01cult to predict what the macro situation is going to be. I think very few peoplewould have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with -- it sort of came outof nowhere. So I think in the absence of something -- some massive force majeure event, like quitemassive, I think [50%] is the likely number. It's possible that it's 40%. I would be very shocked ifit's less than 40% even with force majeure, short of World War III."

        "paragraph": "Okay. The next question from retail investors, when will you announce the next Giga? How manyGigas do you have planned for the next 5 years?Elon R.

That's -- that could happen. It will certainly be within 3months and possibly 1 month. And that would be in the U.S. So as for how many will be in 5 years?I'm not -- I don't know right now what that number would be.

What is your installation per week target for the end of2021?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWe were actually gaining tremendous momentum with the Solar Roof before COVID, but COVIDessentially shut us down, both from the ability to install and the ability to get permits, like permitof\ufb01ces were closed. And with the shelter-in-place all over the places, so we obviously cannotinstall. And if you can't get permits, then you can't physically do it. It's physically impossible. So --but I think the long-term trend for Solar Roof is extremely good, and I'm con\ufb01dent that, let's say,within the next, I don't know, year -- maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of1,000 a week. That's not in the middle of winter or something. It's like taking seasonality --allowing for seasonality where it's hard to install on roofs that are covered in snow and ice, but likein, say, spring, I think installing, which is the hard part, we actually have demonstrated the ability tohit 1,000 a week gross build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already, so that's not a problem. It'sbuilding up the install teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roo\ufb01ng industryinstallers.And internally, we want to have at least 1,000 Solar Roof install teams with -- and taking a week orperhaps a little less than a week to do an install, which gets you 1,000 a week roof installations. Wesee demand is good. Production is good. So it's really all about the install. And then like I said alsobuilding out the -- training the very diverse group of companies in the roo\ufb01ng industry to alsoinstall Solar Roof that I think will scale -- allow us to scale far beyond 1,000 a week. We're alsoseeing a lot of interest outside of North America. So we do expect this to be a product that isinternational and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from China on the Solar Roof.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think, well, we all need a Hiro. And obviously, he brings tremendous amount of experienceinvesting at the highest levels in the world and has done great work as -- at the Japan pension fund,which is the largest, I think, fund of any kind in the world. And generally, the conversations overthe years is just churning incredible insight into how the securities -- the global security marketswork and what he thinks is -- whether [areas perform]. It just -- it seems like he has a strongphilosophical understanding about how to make the future better. And he shares our view regardingthe environment. And he's a very sensible, smart person who brings a lot to the Board and I think isgenerally recognized as such by many people.Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co.

We meet regularly one-on-one and talk all the time. And sothat relationship is strong.

Elon, you talked about full autonomy by the end of the year. Iwould love for you to walk through the rollout strategy of the Tesla Network app and how that'sgoing to look prior to the robotaxi stage? Are you going to gradually take over human routes withautonomous capable routes over time? Or how do you see that playing out?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it's pretty much going to play out as it has played out, which is we'll release more and morefunctionality. Before we release any functionality, it goes through"

And of course,we run it -- we have a simulations team that has, I think, a very good simulation of the real world.So we run any car changes through a battery test and simulation. Then we have a global QA team,which I'm on actually, I'm one of -- on the global QA team. And we test the releases in the realworld, in the real-world map, [then if it \ufb01ts] in the real world and the simulation, which is -- whichare very many because the world is very complex anyway. And then we release it to a small groupof private beta testers within the company; then to a larger beta audience, including people outsidethe company; then to Early Access Tesla owners; and then, \ufb01nally, a broad release. And so there aremany stages that these things go through. So by the time something is being -- going to a widerelease into the U.S., it has gone through all of those stages. And the software that's at the very earlystage is much more advanced than what people are seeing.So it just got to go through a very rigorous safety process.

So we talk every week and meet every week when we can becausenow physical meeting is dif\ufb01cult. So I have quite a deep understanding where we are and wherewe're heading. And I feel like we have a tremendous amount of momentum, and we'll have thefunctionality, that's the Full Self-Driving, by the end of the year.Now after that functionality is released, there's still another step, which is to improve the reliabilityof it once it is released, kind of Full Self-Driving with the human -- supervised by the driver. Andthen we keep improving the reliability to a point where it no longer needs to be supervised by thedriver. And we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this is the case.

If it's a normal distribution, I'd giveyou the 50th percentile, not the 3 segment -- optimistic or pessimistic. So then that necessarilymeans at least half of my predictions will be wrong and half will be right. I think -- or it might beright but offset by a few weeks to a few months; in some cases, a few years. But I believe thateverything I've ever said would come true, did come true.

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOne on gross margin, \ufb01rst, and your impressive performance in Q1. So there are 3 moving parts: thetailwind from credits, of course; the Model Y ramping, even if it broke even, it probably tookaverage gross margin down; and of course, you had like Fremont being closed, shut down the lastweek of the quarter, it probably was the sort of an extra cost. And so when I looked at how grossmargin evolved sequentially, excluding these 3 moving parts, I felt like your auto gross margincould have been up like a couple of points sequentially. So I wanted to check with you if thatestimate would make sense. And then I will have a follow-up on energy storage.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSequential market improvement -- margin improvement?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes.

        "paragraph": "a little bit of a hard time hearing the full questionhere because we're having a bit of network dif\ufb01culty in the room. I'll do my best here. So when welook at margin, we do exclude credit, as you have, so I agree with that. Model Y ramping, bringingdown overall gross margin, I agree with that as well. So it was lower than the overall average, andthat will increase with time. And shutdown and ef\ufb01ciencies in both Shanghai and in Fremont alsoweighed on margin, and the Shanghai margin was below the average as well. Even though it'sincreasing quickly and approaching Model 3, it still is below the average.And so I think the sentiment of your question was if you were to remove those factors, was there asequential increase in gross margin. I haven't speci\ufb01cally calculated that, but I think your intuition isright. We saw strength in gross margin across the board, as I mentioned. And in particular, S and Xgross margins continued to improve despite slightly lower volumes there and higher \ufb01xed costamortization.So there's good progress happening, both from the ASP side and the cost reduction side, for ourproducts and production. And I think this also lends itself to the power"
