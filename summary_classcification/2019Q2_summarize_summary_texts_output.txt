"summary_text": "Tesla's Second Quarter 2019 Q&AWebcast. Instructions] As a reminder, this conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Senior Director of Investor Relations, Martin Viecha. Sir, Sir, you may begin."
"summary_text": "Last quarter, we delivered more than 95,000 vehicles, which is a record for Tesla. Model 3 is once again the best-selling premium vehicle in the U.S., outselling all of its gas-powered counterparts combined. By the end of this year, we expect to be producing Model 3s in volume out of Gigafactory Shanghai."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We don't talk too much about like detailed price plans, but I mean if you're asking like what do I think the long-term demand for Model 3 is in Greater China region, I think it's about 5,000 a week. Musk: Our plan is to -- well, to source cars to sort of greater Europe area from Fremont, California, and until we have European Gigafactory operational."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I think we'll -- demand in Q3 will exceed Q2. And then I think Q4 will be, I think, very strong. So we expect like quarter-over-quarter improvements. I think next year will be tough. Q1 and 4 will be good. Q2 will be not as bad but still tough."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: Long term, we are talking 25%, 30%. Not -- long term meaning like a \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0year. That 30% gross margin is, I think, quite likely. We continue to take significant costs out of the Model 3 in particular as well."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We are reconfiguring the floorspace in Fremont, and there's like quite a lot of factory space that'scurrently taken up with the S/X parts warehousing. And we don't really need that, so that's where we're putting the Model Y activity. Jerome Guillen: We're improving the material delivery for S and X just like we have done for Model 3."
"summary_text": "The regulatory credits composition is a mixture of these particular deals that are onetime. There's also some that are production-based over time. And then your final question was on does it make sense to sacrifice pricing to drive regulatory credit incertain markets? It might. But generally, we're selling cars in markets at the prices we think are appropriate."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We don't expect to be cell-constrained in China for the next year. Drew Baglino: That's what our plan looks like right now. Colin Rusch: How should we be thinking about sustainable volumes and pricing on those volumes? And can I have a follow-up question around Model S and Model X saturation?"
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: Service centers are the key to sales, not the retail locations. We're rolling out service centers like crazy. We do have areas that are underrepresented for service centers where the drive time is too long or where populations don't have appropriate access to charging in the service centers."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: We expect to be able to offer full self-driving actually everywhere except EU because there's just some committee rules that were put in place years ago that need to be changed. We really want to get to not merely same-day service but same hour. Sort of like Jiffy Lube but applied to service."
