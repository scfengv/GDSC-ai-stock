        "paragraph": "Instructions]\nBefore we jump in to the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nSo, pardon me for 1 minute. I have a bit of a cold. So let's see. Actually, we're doing this call from the\nGigafactory because that's where the production constraint is for Model 3, from the most important thing\nfor the company. And I always move my desk to wherever -- well, it's not like we have a desk, actually. I\nmove myself to wherever the biggest problem is in Tesla. Somewhat, I really believe that one should lead\nfrom the front lines, and that's why I'm here, and I'll go into some of the Gigafactory issues later in the\ncall, but I'd like to start off by acknowledging some, I think, pretty amazing milestones for Tesla.\nOne thing that I thought was really profound was that we surpassed cumulative deliveries of vehicles. We\nsurpassed 0.25 million cumulative deliveries since the company's inception and had record Model S and X\nnet orders and deliveries last quarter. So things are really, I think, going quite well.\nTo put that into perspective, 5 years ago, we had only delivered 2,500 cars. So our -- the Tesla fleet\nhas grown by a factor of 100 in 5 years. I would expect, 5 years from now, to be at least an order of\nmagnitude, we're beyond where we are right now and possibly even closer towards magnitude.\nBut for the skeptics out there, I'd like to say -- ask them, which one of you predicted that Tesla would go\nfrom 2,500 units delivered to 250,000 units delivered now? I suspect the answer is 0, right? So consider\nyour assumptions for the future on whether they're valid or perhaps pessimistic.\nSo for Model 3, we continue to make significant progress each week. We see no primary problems with\nour supply chain or any of our production processes. Obviously, there are bottlenecks, there are thousands\nof processes in creating the Model 3, and we will move as fast as the slowest and least likely process\namong those thousands. In fact, there's 10,000 unique parts. Or I could just say, of the tens of thousands\nof processes necessary to produce the car, we will move as fast as the least competent and least likely\nelements of that mixture.\nSo while the vast majority are going incredibly well, there are some problem areas, and after I give the\nbusiness overview, I'll do a deep dive into the biggest problem area.\nSo based on where we -- what we know now, as we've gotten really into the details of some of the worst\nbottlenecks, we expect to achieve approximately 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by late Q1 2018, soTESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nprobably sometime in March. This -- I think, in the vast scheme of things, this is a relatively small shift.\nThe Model 3 is a 10-year program, and so we're talking about a few months out of a 10-year program\nthat's, in the grand scheme of things, as certainly if one is doing net present value calculations, this is\nimmaterial.\nThe -- and we have a clear path to that. We understand the bottlenecks. It's difficult to fully understand\nthese things as we actually try to do them. And it's worth noting that some of our manufacturing areas,\nwe're actually seeing capabilities that are, we estimate, in the 6,000 to 7,000 unit per week capability, well\nin excess of the 5,000-unit capability. So -- and we're optimistic with further optimization that many of our\nproduction processes will need fairly little, and in some cases, no -- so I'm not saying no, but almost no\nCapEx to reach something close to 10,000 units per week. It's the amount or how much can be done by\njust beating up robots, shortening the path, intensifying factory, adding additional robots for choke points\nand just making lines go really, really fast. Speed is the ultimate weapon. And our -- the design of Tesla\nModel 3 being that it was designed for manufacturability is turning up to be accurate. It's far easier to\nbuild this car than a Model E -- than a Model S and vastly easier than a Model X.\nThe primary production constraints really by far is in battery module assembly. So this is -- so I'll just\ndo a little bit of a deep dive on that. There are 4 zones to module manufacturing. So it goes through 4\nmajor production zones. The zones 3 and 4 are in good shape; zones 1 and 2 are not. Zone 2 in particular,\nthis is -- we had a subcontractor -- a systems integration subcontractor that unfortunately really dropped\nthe ball, and we did not realize the degree to which the ball was dropped until quite recently, and we had\nto -- this is a very complex manufacturing area. We had to rewrite all of the software from scratch and\nredo many of the mechanical and electrical elements of zone 2 of module production. We've managed\nto rewrite what was about 20 to 30 man years of software in 4 weeks, but there's still a long way to\ngo. It's -- because the software work can be fast with the electromechanical elements that need to be\nfabricated and installed, and that -- getting these items in place and rebuilt is, unfortunately, a lot longer,\nand that's -- it's probably more external constraints than software. This is what I spent many a late night\non the Gigafactory working on. J.B. has been here constantly, and we've -- we allocated many of our best\nengineers to fundamentally fixing zone 2 of the module line and then most problem behind that it is zone\n1.\nOn the plus side, we now have a very detailed understanding of what is necessary to fix zone 1 and zone\n2. We also have a new design for zone 1 and 2 that is about 3x more effective than the current design. So\nwhen we put in -- and there are 3 lines of module production. Lines 1, 2 and 3 are essentially identical.\nLine 4, which will have the new design, will be at triple the effectiveness of -- will be as good as the other\n3 lines combined. So we're very confident about the future path of having incredibly efficient production of\nmodules and that this will not be a constraint in the future, but unfortunately, it just takes some amount of\ntime. This is like moving like lightning compared to the -- while there's no one in the automotive industry,\nthere's still some finer amount of time necessary to fix something that we thought was in good shape.\nWe were told by our supplier it was in good shape, but it was really not. So this has now been typified\nTesla\u2019s internal automation group in the U.S. and -- Tesla automation in the U.S. and Tesla Grohmann from\nGermany. We have a large team on -- from the -- from Tesla Grohmann also working the issue and making\nvery rapid progress. And like I said, I am personally on that line in that machine, trying to solve problems\npersonally where I can. And J.B.'s basically spending his life at the Gigafactory. So that's the sort of deep\ndive on that front.\nThe other thing I want to mention is that there are a lot of articles about Tesla firing employees and laying\noff some lines and stuff. These are really ridiculous. And like anyone -- any journalist who'd written articles\nin this effect should be ashamed of themselves for lacking journalistic integrity. At every company in the\nworld, there's annual performance reviews. In our annual performance review, despite Tesla having an\nextremely high standard, and a standard far higher than other car companies, which we need to have in\norder to survive against much larger car companies, you can't be a little guy and have equal levels of skill\nas the big guy. If you have 2 boxes of equal votes and one's much smaller, the big guy's going to crush\nthe little guy, obviously. So little guy better have a heck of a lot more skill. And that is why both are just\ngoing to get hovered. So that is why our standards are high. They're not high because we believe in being\nmean to people. They're high because if they're not high, we will die.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nDespite that, in our annual performance reviews, only 2% of people didn't make the grade. So that's\nabout 700 people out of 33,000. This is a pretty low percentage. GE, I don't know if they still do, but\nthey certainly have for a long time had a policy of firing 10% of their employees poor performers every\nyear, no matter what. If you were to stack Tesla's performance, late releases compared to industry --\nother companies, the number would be low. So the only reason these articles had any play whatsoever\nis because journalists and editors with low integrity, they'll provide any context for where they stood.\nBecause the actual article would've read, \"Tesla fires 2% of its employee base for performance-based\nreasons. They're remarkably lower number compared to other companies.\" But of course, that will be a\nmeaningless article, so they forget to include that. Shame.\nAnd then also, it was not reported that several thousand employees were promoted, and almost half of\nthose promotions were in manufacturing.\nRight. I think let's go to questions.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nOkay, Latif, let's go to that question queue, please.TESLA, INC.

        "paragraph": "Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James Albertine of Consumer Edge.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\nGreat. Wanted to ask with respect to -- and Elon, thank you for doing the deeper dive into the zones and\nthe bottlenecks. How does this change the trajectory -- or does it change the trajectory from a margin\nperspective on the Model 3? And then maybe as an aside, can you tell us where you are today on a\nproduction-per-week basis and where you expect to be by the end of 2017, just so we can get an idea of\nthe ramp?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI don't really like the week-by-week stuff. But the thing -- the reason it's tricky is because people just\nread too much into it. The ramp curve is a step exponential. So it means like as you alleviate a constraint,\nthe production jumps -- suddenly jumps at a much higher number. And then so although it looks a little\nstaggered, if you sort of zoom out, that production ramp is an exponential with giant week-over-week\nincreases. I'd like to state a number at the end of Q4, but there's too much uncertainty right now to give\nthat with any precision. Now I do feel confident about the end of Q1, maybe sooner, but really, it's like --\nwe're like in a vertical climb here. So it's really hard to say it. Yes.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd also to your earlier point -- Deepak here. It does not change any of our projections in terms of the\nlong-term target gross margin. These are all short-term issues.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nRight. I mean, it's -- just let me state, by the end of the year, it will be in the thousands. It's well at the\nend. Yes. Yes.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\nI'm sorry, well into the thousands per week or by...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIn the thousands by the end of the year. But where exactly, it's hard to say. And this way, if you move\nthe calendar by like 2 or 3 weeks, you will see giant changes. So it's like the quarter-to-date will fall\nsomewhat sort of arbitrarily in that exponential curve. So even a matter of a few weeks would show a very\ndifferent number. As far as like people tend to extrapolate on a linear basis instead of an exponential. First\nof all, you all know what an exponential is. So if your intuition is -- tends to be a straight-line extrapolation\nbut really on a very steep exponential. So it's really an S-curve. So it starts off really slow, and then it\nramps very rapidly on an exponential basis. And this starts to go sort of linear right in the middle and\nthen it sort of asymptotes off at the target production capacity. You really target a whole supply chain or a\nfactory for a given production capacity. And yes, probably get this done as soon as possible. We're also --\nwe're highly confident of the long-term margin number of 25% or higher for Model 3. Deepak, I mean...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nYes, none of our projections in terms of our material cost or manufacturing, labor and overhead or\ndepreciation of the other elements have changed as a result of these last few months to modify that\ntarget.",

Elon, you described Model 3 -- the Model 3 launch as production hell.\nHow -- I mean, you have a cold, but how hot is it in hell right now? And is it getting hotter or less hot? I\nmean, are we solving worse problems that are coming up?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, I mean, it's sort of imprecise. I'm just shooting at what this level means really, but let's say level\n9 is the worst, okay? We were in level 9. We're now in level 8, and I think we're close to exiting level\n8. I thought we'd be probably more like in level 7 by now, but it's -- and I have to tell you, I was really\ndepressed about 3 or 4 weeks ago when I realized that we were kind of in level 9. Then we got to level\n8. Now I can see sort of a clear path to sunshine. And so I feel really pretty optimistic right now. If you\ntalked to me 3 to 2 weeks ago, I'd be -- I would've been quite pessimistic, and I was for sort of quite\ndown the dumps. But now it's very obvious what we need to do. It's just a matter of work to get there.\nWe're working 7 days a week to do it. And I've personally been here on zone 2 module line at 2 a.m. on\na Sunday morning, helping diagnose robot calibration issues. So I'm doing everything I can. J.B. is doing\neverything he can. The whole team's on it, we're on it. And we are on it, we've got it covered, it's going to\ntake us a few much longer than we expected.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nGot it. Just one follow-up for Deepak. The -- on the secured bonds due 2025, the issuance from last\nAugust, was this meant to be a permanent part of the cap structure? Or is it more of a bridge loan to help\nfund some of the near-term cash absorption issues related to the Model 3 delay and things of that nature?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nIt is. It's an 8-year tenure on that debt offering and meant to give us that capital for that time frame.",

        "paragraph": "The next question comes from Tyler Frank of Baird.\nBenjamin Joseph Kallo\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nIt's been Ben Kallo for Baird. Elon, you guys talk a lot about the 3 being easier to manufacture than the\nS and the X. Could you just give us a sense, though, about the difference of manufacturing the volume of\nthe 3 compared to -- you -- basically 10x the volume that you're trying to get to in the near term? Then I\nhave a follow-up.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. There's vastly more automation with Model 3. Now the tricky thing is that when one front of this -- of\nthat automation doesn't work, it's way harder to make up for it with manual labor. So with S or X, because\na lot less of it was automated, you -- we could scale up labor hours and achieve a high level of production.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nWith Model 3, it's like -- tends to be either the machine works or it doesn't or it's lumping along and we\nget short quite severely on output. So yes. I mean, J.B., do you want to add?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes, I think that's spot on. Because the design on a whole is much easier to build...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. By a lot.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nBut the -- it's also intensely automated, which is part of what lets us realize the margin in the cost targets.\nBut that does become difficult to bring that automation online. That's really -- that's where we are.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd Doug is on the line. Perhaps he can add some on ease of manufacturability.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nDoug, do you want to maybe cite a few examples?\nJohn Douglas Field\nSenior Vice President of Engineering\nSure. The number of actual, what we call a pitch, which is a station for a robot to work on the car in\ngeneral assembly, is about 1/4 of the typical industry average for number of stations it uses to build a\ncar. So the way we do subassemblies and the care we've taken and designed for manufacturing does\nmake it much simpler. But as J.B. said, each of those stations is fairly automated and requires time and\nengineering to make it work.\nBenjamin Joseph Kallo\nRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division\nAnd I guess, my follow-up's on that point. So in the battery assembly and automation, things that you're\nworking through, and the software for configuring the robots is how I'm thinking of this, is it a certain\nnumber of man-hours that have to go into this and then it's fixed? Or like you know the fix? Or what are\nyou throwing at it right now? Is it people or is it time required to do or all of the above?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. We're throwing a sheer amount of people at replacing machines. And then occasionally, there's like\nsome part of a production manufacturing process where the machine is probably kind of like broken, and\nthen we have to kind of bypass to a manual operation.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nUntil we fix the automation.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderTESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nYes, until we fix the automation. But that's really -- it's really inefficient because this thing is really not\ndesigned for a manual bypass to your broken machine or a machine when the software is not right or\nwhatever the case may be.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nIt's just an extremely complicated machine with the combined electrical, mechanical and software\nchallenges. It's not that different than what we do bringing up a brand-new car and a lot of the...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. It is harder to supplement with manuals than S or X because the system is designed as a very tightly\nintegrated automated system. So if there's an [ X brand ] -- we will be to try to supplement or make up\nfor a machine not working with manual activity. So we think of it like -- it's like if you had a spreadsheet\nand a couple of cells in the spreadsheet were manually calculated, well, yes, you could still do your\nspreadsheet stuff but it's going to be a lot slower until the last cell is automated, and then it's going to be\nsuper fast.",

We're actually at a technology\nconference today hosted by NVIDIA. And their newest autonomous solution, according to NVIDIA,\nis 10x more powerful than the version that Tesla's using, and they're saying it can get you to level 5\nautonomy. And so along those lines, the year-over-year improvement in the NVIDIA board just seems\nreally significant. And I was curious, Elon, if you could just talk about what you think you need to do from\na hardware perspective to advance Autopilot.\nElon R.

The question\nis not just full autonomy, but full autonomy with what level of reliability and what will be acceptable to\nregulators. But I feel quite confident that we can achieve human-level -- approximately human-level\nautonomy with the current computing hardware. Now regulators may require some significant margin\nabove human capability in order for a full autonomy to be engaged. I mean to say it needs to be 50%\nsafer, 100% safer, 1,000% safer, I don't know. I'm not sure they know either. But that's -- but I think I'm\nconfident that when we can get to approximately human level with our current hardware.

I'm\njust curious, as we think about cash flow for the next 2 quarters, would we think about them relatively\nsimilarly to what we just saw in the third quarter plus what you would -- whatever you would sell out of\ninventory so it might be a bit better? I'm just trying to understand, Deepak, how much of that $2.5 billion\nin the inventory is finished goods that you might be able to sell out of in the fourth quarter.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nWell, firstly, as we continue to ramp up Model 3, our cash flow of operations is going to increase or\nimprove significantly over the next few quarters. And it's -- this is the positive virtuous cycle of cash flow\nof working capital that Model 3 provides us, because we effectively pay our suppliers later when we collect\nfrom our customers.

So firstly, our inventory is going to come down on S and X, and also, what's important is it is -- given\nthese short-term delays, we have to be prudent in how we spend our money.

But I think, if you extrapolate from 5,000 units towards\nthe end of Q1, we do want to hold off on giving CapEx until we are confident about cash flow on Model 3.\nSo then that's a question of how long it takes to implement everything necessary to get to 10,000 units a\nweek for Model 3, which is a number we are confident can be sustained from a [ grand ] standpoint.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd we want to figure out how much we can push the 5,000 up from the existing equation.\nElon R.

So it's the right thing to do.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. Yes, exactly. As I mentioned earlier, we're finding that some parts of the line, they very clearly are\ncapable of 6,000 or that 7,000 units a week, and maybe more than that, just by shortening path length,\nspeeding up robots, adding some robots where there are -- where the choke points exist, simplifying some\nof the processes and a few minor part redesigns sum up for how much you can improve cycle time.

FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nPiper Jaffray Companies, Research Division\nYes, was wondering, I guess, to the extent that these production bottlenecks are ultimately somebody\nelse's fault, is it worth your time trying to call back some of the cost that you're presumably incurring due\nto the subcontractor, I guess, dropping the ball, as you put it?\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. I think first of all, I think, at the end of the day, everything is our fault and my problem, most of\nall. If we picked the wrong subcontractor, we're the fault. So just -- I don't want us to be -- sort of us\nexternalizing responsibility. Really, it's our fault for picking the wrong supplier and then not realizing it\nuntil way later in the game. We will be able to call back some amounts, but it certainly will not make up\nfor the lost revenue, the lost free cash flow. So some amount, yes, but it's not going to matter that much.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nThe goal is right now to fix the problem.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, exactly.\nAlexander Eugene Potter\nPiper Jaffray Companies, Research Division\nOkay, fair enough. I guess, one other issue, you referenced a gross margin headwind on the S and X due\nto trim and mix. Was wondering if you could talk maybe a little bit more explicitly about what that was,\nand then what the corrective measures you're taking to address that.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. Jon you want to answer?\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nYes, it's Jon. I can address a piece of this. So a large chunk of it was discontinued trims. We've introduced\nthe 100-kilowatt battery pack, which has a 335-mile range in Model S. And as a result of that, we\ndiscontinued the 90-kilowatt pack. And as those cars were in inventory, we reduced price to move them\nout. And so that was a piece of the gross margin headwind that won't repeat in -- as we go forward.\nAnd in addition to that, the mix did shift. We sold more 100-kilowatt cars actually than we predicted we\nwould, but order rate went up for the 75s even faster. And so we sold more 75-kilowatt cars in the mix\nthan we'd predicted, and that had a gross margin impact as well. Given demand is in -- it continues to\nincrease for the 100-kilowatt pack and the mix shift is occurring more towards that product, we'll see, as\nwe indicated in the letter, increasing margins as we roll into Q4 and then into Q1. So this is -- the heart\nof the discontinuation really was the success of us debottlenecking the 100-kilowatt production that we've\ntalked about in Q2 and really rolling out into strong demand in Q3.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. We also just increased the amount of value that's in a Model S...\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nAnd the X.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nAnd X, but particularly Model S, because we're hoping it to be greater differentiation between the S and\nthe Model 3. So the basic cost, the fundamental cost of a Model S increased because of more included\ncontent. So the full Model Ss have air suspension, for example, perhaps a bunch of premium contents\nwere included by default. Just about there needs to be a get clear reason for people to buy a Model S over\na Model 3.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nAnd the market responded really strongly to that in terms of demand. So in Q3, the Model S in the U.S.\noutsold the Mercedes S-Class by 2x -- over 2x, actually. And if you added up the sales of Audi A7 and A8,\nthe BMW 7 Series and the Porsche Panamera, we outsold all those combined. So the market really did\nrespond to the increased value.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. And all of our deliveries in terms of our market share in the U.S., it went up in Q3 for S and X.\nEspecially...\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nS and X, both.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nIn the recent market, yes compared to Q2.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. And I suppose some of the articles from our quarterly earnings letter about sort of answer your\nquestion kind of S and X -- why we reduced production on S and X. We didn't reduce it very much. It's\njust sort of perhaps from about 2,000 units a week to 1,800, and we did in order to bring down inventory.\nSo mainly just because inventory was too high. We also just needed a bunch of people on the Model 3\nline. So we thought we'll take the third shift from Model S and the X and apply it to Model 3. Because\nreally, running out of labor pool, honestly. It's like we're second labor pool dry, both in -- in one of the\nGigafactory and in Fremont. And so it's like -- yes, there's just only so many people that can make it to\nthe factory. And then we're out finding that we're able to improve the efficiency of the production of the\nS and X. So previously, it required 3 shifts to do 2,000 units a week. And it's important to appreciate, like\nthe whole supply chain and everything is all -- it's all sized to 2,000 units a week. Sure, like why can't\nyou just spontaneously make 2,500 units a week? Well, it's because the entire supply chain, all the parts,\neverything's got to go to 2,500, and that requires a bunch of CapEx. Then you got to match sort of --\nthe increase stores. Like everything's got to sort of work in cadence. So we sort of like decided on what\nseems like the right number. We think sort of the right number's about 100,000 units a year, combined\nS and X, and resize the supply chain accordingly. But we expect to continue making production efficiency\nimprovements on the S and X line and be able to take that from -- you're up at 1,800 units a week to\n2,000 units a week in probably over the next year and still be on 2 shifts, which means that our labor\nhours are reducing per vehicle, and that gets us to our sort of roughly 100,000 unit a year cadence andTESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nwe can work on supply chain efficiencies and the like. But we do expect to make an important point. We\nexpect to sell more cars in Q4...\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nCorrect. Than we did in Q3.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nThan in Q3. So we expect sales and deliveries to be higher in Q4 than Q3 but have to reduce Model S and\nX inventory to achieve that.",

And\nobviously, there've also been some reports about you investing in another assembly facility in China. So is\nyour CapEx still expected to be lower in 2018 versus 2017?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nSo Rod, in terms of the China factory, I'll leave for Elon to make comments on that. But I think maybe\nbetter if we hold on, broadly speaking, to that question to the next quarter when we provide full 2018\nguidance and give you better clarity on our capital spend for the different elements in our plan.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI suspect it's comparable and similar to 2017. We have some -- obviously some -- it's somewhat of a\nstrategic choice. Do we have higher CapEx and higher growth or lower CapEx and lower growth? Yes.\nSo it's -- if we do that we can move that lever where it makes sense, where it makes sense to do so. As\nmentioned earlier though, we want to make sure we know what to scale before we spend money on it.\nAnd so for the Model 3, figuring out which production lines can be simply accelerated and which production\nlines need to be duplicated. We'd far rather accelerate production line than duplicate it. If we were to\nmake those CapEx decisions because right now, we'd be making them -- we'd be kind of shooting in the\ndark.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, exactly.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nBut -- in respect to China, I wouldn't expect any significant CapEx on China until 2019. It won't be\nmaterial in 2018. The China plan is sort of maybe something like -- this is just a -- like don't set your\nwatch by this, but we -- it's sort of a rough target of start manufacturing in about 3 years, and it would\nbe serving the China market and perhaps the -- some other countries in the region. And that's really its\nintent, is to be able to provide Model 3 and Model Y. We won't be making Model S and X, but we'll be\nmaking probably Model 3, probably Model Y primarily for the local Chinese market. And it's really the only\nway to make the cars affordable in China.

Elon, you just talked about sort of this trade-off between\ngrowth and capital spending. And quite frankly, I think it's really the first time that I've heard you talk\nabout that potential trade-off. Usually, Tesla's been all about doing as much as quickly as possible to lead\nthe move to electrification, to establish a first-mover advantage, et cetera. So is the hesitancy in going\nall-out growth? Is that a concern that you might run out of cash and have to raise more cash? Is that a\nbandwidth concern for the organization in terms of trying to do too much too quickly? Is that a concern\nabout using capital effectively? What's at the root of that decision? And why isn't the -- why is there even\na decision, I guess, is the question?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nI mean, I would say it's probably a bit of all. I mean, it's prudent for us to think through all of that as we\nare continuing to grow. Certainly, we would want to be in a certain sense of fiduciary responsibility that we\nhave in addition to just growing like crazy. So...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nI mean, these are mad, substantial growth rates for the car industry. And I think some made some\ncomparison of Tesla's growth rate relative to Ford in the Model T era. And we're talking about a rate of\ngrowth faster than the Model T, which is the fastest in history. So these are nutty growth rates.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nIt's certainly not the first time we've thought about this.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. We have talked about that. When our growth rate, I don't have -- recall the exact numbers, but I\nthink it's been in the 70%, 80% every year. And next year even with 5,000, it'll be like crazy compared to\nthis year. So our growth rate continues to be extraordinary.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderTESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nYes. Yes. If our growth rate continues at anything like that in the coming years, I mean, if it continues to\nbe something like that, Tesla will be the largest car company in the world by volume as well.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nAnd Toni, it may be helpful if it accelerates with new product introductions too. Model X reached Model S\ndemand rates in half the time. So at twice the rate of demand build. So not only are we growing, but we're\naccelerating as we grow.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, exactly. Right. Model 3 will be, I'd call it, 5x -- it'll be 5x Model S or X.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nYes, and, if you look at the timing and its order of magnitude, shifts downward.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nBut really, perhaps to punctuate a little bit more, you've talked about pretty soon you're going to be close\nto cash flow-generative once you get the volume on the Model 3. And so I'm just surprised why you're\nactually not trying to step on that as quickly as possible, because extensively, once you get to that level,\nthen cash flow really doesn't become a problem. And so is there any difference in that view? Otherwise,\nI'm just struggling to sort of reconcile why you don't want to get to scale, get to volume, get to positive\noperating cash flow as quickly as possible.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nJust to be clear, we are trying to get as fast as we can to 5,000, and then we will work as fast as we can to\nget to 10,000.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nYes. I don't think we were saying we wouldn't do it. We're just saying we have to think through it and\nmake the strategic trade-offs in terms of timing. But we'd think through it.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, I mean it's sort of like we're wondering what fuels everyone's interpretations of timescales.

Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionTESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nRight, okay. If I could just follow up on a separate topic. On the S and X gross margins, they look like they\nmust have fallen materially, unless Model 3 gross margins were worse than minus 1,000%. So maybe you\ncan help us understand what S and X margins -- gross margins were this quarter. And given most of the\nonetime stuff is gone and the mix shift is favorable, why wouldn't they snap back to be similar or better\nnext quarter? And do you think that the promotional activity helped drive volume for S and X this quarter?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. I mean, I -- firstly, your analysis is completely off from what we see internally. And the mix shift that\nwe saw, part of that continues in Q4 and...\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nLargely because we're custom -- we're largely custom orders, so there's orders that were placed in Q3\nthat we will ship in Q4.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nRight. And then as we achieve -- well, continue to achieve efficiencies and also work on that mix shift,\nwhich takes time, we will continue to see improvement. And I have full confidence in S and X gross\nmargin.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. Because the Tesla cars being sold in Q4 are inventory rundown and some clearing older models.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nService loaners.\nElon R.

So I think what you see there is the increase in PP&E for the service infrastructure. We wanted to\nget out in front of demand as we're increasing both S and X fleet size and also of Model 3. So we opened\na location just about every 4 days in Q3. And to get ahead of that demand, you probably saw that we\nput 180 mobile vehicles on the road, and we plan to double that this quarter. And so a lot of that, whatTESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nyou see is PP&E. In terms of the drivetrain issue that you mentioned, that's mostly behind us. In fact, we\nsee very little of that now. The reliability for S and X continues to improve. And you asked about the CPO\nbusiness.

And so that business\nis growing rapidly at the same time. And we're running those -- we do our own CPO refurbishment. We do\nthat in the same service infrastructure that we're servicing the cars.

And my follow-on for Deepak, probably, is can you walk us through the depreciation when you\nproduce, for example, in the second quarter those 100 -- P100D cars Mr. Musk talked about going into the\nloaner fleet? Where do those -- how do those get depreciated while they're in the loaner fleet? And when\nthey're transferred to be sold, what's the accounting on that?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes.

Yes.\nJohn Douglas Field\nSenior Vice President of Engineering\nIt's not the same level of constraint as the Gigafactory, but it is one of the more complex parts of the\noverall assembly line. So to reach our overall production goals, that has to ramp significantly. But again,\nit's not at the same level of constraint as modules. And it's really driven just by the sheer number of\nrobots in the body shop. It's the highest concentration of robots anywhere in our overall production line.\nBut it is coming up well.

It's -- really come to realize that the -- you\nreally want to make a factory go incredibly fast.

        "summary_text": "The next question comes from Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Joseph: Is there still going to be a discrepancy between the run rate of different parts of the entire line? Or do you think everything will be roughly at the same level? Elon: We actually feel even more strongly that our efficiency of CapEx will be significant compared to the first phase."

        "paragraph": "The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nColin William Rusch\nOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\nCould you talk about the percentage of sales that are coming from these loaners to the fleet vehicles?\nWe're trying to reconcile the MSRP declines that you implemented and what, it looks like, is a little\nbit more severe ASP decline. And then also, if you could talk a little bit about why you felt that it was\nnecessary to add value to the Model S and Model X while lowering price. It seems like you should be able\nto drive volumes with one or the other.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, I think, to the first question, I would say it's roughly about 5% of [ total sales ]\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nYes. Very -- yes. Very low single digits in terms of service loaner sales as a percentage of total units.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. We -- as far as the prices, it was -- Model X was always -- it was really the one that saw more of a\nprice reduction than other things. And then the 100-kilowatt hour pack, which was -- 100-kilowatt pack\ncars was artificially priced high because we were production -- like really production-constrained on that\npack. It was never our intention to price it quite that high, so we reduced it a little bit and then added\nsome content as to both. So we just sort of split it between some price reductions where we thought\nthings were a little overpriced, and then added some content just to have a clear differentiation. We\nweren't quite sure what the response would be to the Model 3. So maybe we might have overcorrected a\nlittle bit, but that's kind of where it is.\nColin William Rusch\nOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\nOkay. And then just moving to the China strategy. Obviously, with the permanent magnet requirements\nfor the DC motor for the Model 3 and what we've seen historically with export restrictions in China and\nimproved environmental enforcement in terms of mining practices, how important is that to the strategy of\nmoving into China and maintaining your supply lines for the growth of the Model 3?\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nI think we think about China more from a demand side than anything. We're building complete cars and\nshipping them. We're shipping them across the ocean and into the largest electric vehicle market in the\nworld. So what really pulls us into China primarily is to be able to supply that market and to make the cars\nmore affordable, as Elon said, so that we're not forcing consumers to experience tariffs as we bring those\ncars in. That's a much bigger impact than any of the supply chain or sourcing materials issue.",

        "paragraph": "The next question comes from Rob Cihra of Guggenheim.\nRobert George Cihra\nGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division\nGreat. I recognize it's not the biggest focus right now, but I'm just curious on solar declining as you\nexpected, but just wondering when you think that can start growing again. Is that a function of Solar\nRoof? Or is that sort of moving past your sales changes? And then, I guess, similarly on energy storage,\nthe ramp looking -- sort of exiting this year into 2018, is that constrained by the Model 3? Or is that on its\nown separate track?TESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes, we are -- we do expect the solar demand to rebound as we move solar sales into all of our stores,\nwhich is a much more efficient channel for demand generation. And that's just what's sort of conventional\nsolar. The Solar Roof stuff, we expect, is going to be at -- or well, we're confident it's going to have\nextremely high demand. And we're just going through the validation process for the solar trials. It does --\nand they're working right now, I should point out. So I have the Solar Roof tiles on my house. So -- and\nI don't even notice that they're there because they blend in so well. But they -- so they look really good\nbut a roof is expected to last a long time. So at least 25, 30 years. And so there's some rate at which we\ncan do accelerated life testing on -- for the rest of the component. So we can maybe try to accelerate life\ntesting on a 30-year roof in sort of 6 months, but it's hard to do it in less than about that 6 months. So\nand then we're going to pack that into the production process. So I have no doubt that this will be a very\nsignificant part of the business down the road, it just takes a little while to get this behemoth rolling. But\nonce it gets rolling, it's going to be a behemoth.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nAnd we continue to install pilot engineering, early customer homes. We continue the cadence of that.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. You have one in your house in the woods.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes, this is J.B. I installed one, and quite a few others at this point more than 10. And we still are on track\nto turn on some -- most of the production line in Buffalo at the end of this year to start ramping final\nactual production versus this in the final factory.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nAnd maybe to your point about the separation from Model 3, those production areas are largely separate.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nThat's right for the pack side.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes, storage versus vehicles. The energy storage production is actually growing at a really -- actually doing\nreally well by our ability to complete the South Australia project or be on track to complete that. That's...\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nIn Puerto Rico.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ3 2017 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 01, 2017\nAs well -- yes, as well as the deployments in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the Caribbean. That's been\nrunning at nominal rate and doing quite well. So those are quite separate.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nAnd down the road, there will be some cell conflict. I mean, I think if you sort of fast-forward a year or 2,\nwe really need to think about cell production as being a constraint. And some of the [indiscernible] going\ninto cell production so they can go a couple of years out, making sure that we have a secure supplies of\nlithium hydroxide, cobalt. There's actually more amount of cobalt. I mean to say nickel, but yes, sort of...\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nNickel, graphite, copper or aluminum.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes. The separator like line.\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales & Service\nThe module ones that we're operating to assemble the cells into modules are totally separate. So that --\nit's this Model 3 module line in that order that we're focused on right now and improving quickly, but the\nenergy module line, in the same building, coincidentally, but it is a totally separate line.\nElon R. Musk\nCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder\nYes.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nOkay. I think that's, unfortunately, all the time we have today. Appreciate all your great questions, and we\nlook forward to talking to you next quarter. Goodbye.",
