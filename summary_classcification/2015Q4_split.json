Sir, you may begin.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nThank you, Latiff, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015\nQ&A Webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Tesla Chairman and CEO; J.B. Straubel, our CTO; CFO,\nJason Wheeler; and Jon McNeill, President of Global Sales, Service and Delivery.\nOur Q4 results are announced in the update letter at the same link as this webcast. As usual, this letter\nincludes GAAP and non-GAAP financial information and reconciliations between the 2.\nDuring our call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These are\nbased on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due\nto a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent Form 10-Q filed with\nthe SEC.\nWe're going to start today's call with some comments by Elon and then Jason, and then we'll go into the\nQ&A session.

        "paragraph3": "And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Elon.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nThank you. So I think the newsletter probably speaks for itself, but I'll add some commentary on some of\nthe lead points.\nSo obviously, we had a huge increase in Model S deliveries year-on-year in Q4 last year, going up 76%.\nWe had a huge change in our core operational cash flow, which you can really see in the chart, and it's\nreally quite dramatic. That's why I think it's interesting to look at in chart form. It goes from negative to\nsignificantly positive in Q4 last year. And then we made modest improvements in Model S gross margin,\ngetting to about 25% excluding onetime items, and we feel pretty good about where we're tracking to\nprobably get close to 30% by the -- by about Q4 this year.\nAnd then something I'm personally quite excited about is that we expect to be positive cash flow starting\nnext month and then continue on into Q2 and beyond. And that's -- there's only one caveat there that's\nincluding the asset-backed line, and the asset-backed line is -- that's just funding for cars that are en\nroute to customers. So particularly as sales to international markets increases, there's more finished\ngoods inventory on its way to customers. And so inclusive of the asset-backed line, which really I think is\n-- was accurately regarded as a slight decrease in the gross margin of the car by about roughly 0.1% or\nthereabouts. Apart from that, we're positive cash flow.\nAnd then we're expecting to be profitable for 2016 on a non-GAAP basis. And I personally think that, that\nis actually the correct way to think -- to look at it because of the way that GAAP treats lease accounting.\nAnd -- but then nonetheless, despite the lease accounting stuff, we anticipate being profitable by GAAP\nstandards in Q4 of this year.\nAnd then we're really looking forward to the -- building the Model 3 on -- at the end of next month. I think\nthis is going to be really well received and then getting into production and delivery at the end of next\nyear.TESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nTouching on a few things that are in the bulk of the newsletter. I think the chart on vehicle demand\nis really interesting. And to the degree that this represents a microcosm of how Tesla vehicles will be\nreceived in other vehicle segments, it augurs extremely well for the future. So the Model S was the best-\nselling premium sedan in the United States last year of any kind. And our sales actually increased by\n51%, whereas everybody else's sales declined and the overall market segment declined by about 1%. So\nI think this is -- it's really rare to see situations like this. And I think this is despite us being really quite\nunderpenetrated in the Northeast. I think there's a lot of room for growth in the Northeast particularly in\nthe U.S. and in international markets in general.\nSo -- but essentially, getting to a 25% market share of all premium sedans in the U.S. is, I think, a great\nachievement of the Tesla team. And I think it's also great for the world because it means that's 25,000\nfewer gas guzzlers that are on the road. I'd like to thank all the customers that went out and bought that\ncar because I think they're making a difference for the environment. And of course, they're helping pay\nfor the future development of the Model 3, which is the more affordable mass-market car. That's where\nwe put all of the revenue we receive from the Model S and X. So it's really important to bear that in mind,\nthat S and X are what pay for the Model 3.\nAnd that's -- and one additional note is that Tesla does not advertise. We don't pay for any endorsements.\nWe do not discount our cars for anyone, including me. I pay full retail price. Whereas those actions are --\nall of our competitors take those actions. So that's, I think, quite interesting. We also have far fewer sales\noutlets than our competitors. Essentially, there's a lot of degrees of freedom that we are not exercising\nthat we could, in theory, exercise.\nI think -- oh, and if you look at the text, it's worth noting that this is not just uniquely true in the United\nStates. But in Switzerland, we outsold -- the Model S outsold the Mercedes S-Class, the BMW 7 Series,\nPorsche Panamera and the Audi 8 combined and also outsold the Mercedes E-Class. And in Germany, we\noutsold the Porsche Panamera. So I think these are pretty good situations. I mean, this is even in places\nthat have no incentives. Obviously, incentives are certainly helpful. They're a catalyst for sales. They're --\nso Tesla always appreciates the incentives, and I think they make a difference in accelerating the advent\nof electric vehicles. But sometimes incentives are characterized as it's sort of all about incentives or not at\nall about incentives. And it's really important to appreciate that incentives are an accelerant. But that's the\nreality of them.\nJason, do you want to add anything?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSure, absolutely. Thanks, Elon. First of all, I look forward to working with everybody. I'm super excited to\nbe here, as excited as I was on the first day I walked through the door.\nJust 3 quick things I want to touch on real quick. Number one, gross margin, lots of moving parts this\nquarter. And let me walk you guys through it a little bit. We had over $67 million in Model X ramp-up costs\nand nonrecurring items in the quarter, as Elon mentioned. Correcting for these items, automotive gross\nmargin, excluding ZEV credits, would have been 25%.\nFirst thing, the major component here is labor and overhead and depreciation related to the Model X\nlaunch. The way for you all to think about this is towards end of Q3 and into Q4, we had to bring the\nworkforce into the factory to build these wonderful vehicles. Also, as soon as start-up production starts,\nthe clock starts hitting on depreciation as well. So that's what's going on there. We also had some asset\nimpairments, one with our old paint shop. And we've now got a state-of-the-art paint shop in place, which\nis going to give us the capacity that we need all the way through Model 3...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, that's 10,000 cars a week too.\nJason S. WheelerTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, 10,000 cars a week. So this is a good story, and these are assets that we had purchased all -- go all\nthe way back to the NUMMI days. So we got every bit of life out of those assets as we possibly could.\nThe other big piece here is we had an E&O write-off, excess and obsolescence. This is a result of better\nproduction control and inventory management systems that we put in place. The place is moving really\nfast, and we took some time, Elon talked about this in Q2 on the earnings call during the shutdown,\nputting better systems in place to track this. We're moving to a place where we're tracking E&O on a real-\ntime basis and bringing those facts to the table when we're making decisions. So we shouldn't be in this\nposition again.\nNext thing I wanted to talk about just real quickly was cash flow. And Elon covered this, and I think\nthe chart on the face of the shareholder letter really gets there. But we were within striking distance of\npositive operating cash flows there. And when you add back the leasing proceeds that we get of $209\nmillion, it's a great step change in the right direction to getting us to net cash flow positive.\nAlso CapEx, we guided to $500 million last quarter on the call, and we closed out at $411 million for the\nquarter. That all resulted in ending cash balance being at $1.2 billion, which I think showcases our strong\nimprovement in cash management and discipline with the company.\nFinally and really quickly, talk about capital structure. We closed the warehouse line that we previously\nhad before and opened the ABL, as Elon mentioned. Think of this as a shift to lower-cost financing. We've\ngot a better deal on this line. So I think it's a better way to think about that. Intended uses, one, we'll\ncontinue to monetize our direct leases as we did with the warehouse line. But it also creates an option for\nus to finance our ramp in FGI as the Model X hits full production scale.\nI'll just close by saying my mandate from Elon is clear: Cash is king. And there's some real steps that\nwe're taking as a company to get ourselves to net cash flow positive for the year...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nAnd profitability.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nAnd profitability. One more, it's just capital efficiency in CapEx. CapEx in 2016, as we said in the past,\nwill be less than it was in 2015. We started to see some of this in Q4. It will continue. We're also getting\nto a point where we have operating leverage in the business. We'll continue to aggressively manage our\ngrowth in expenses. And then finally, and I walk around and I'm on this every day, is a relentless focus on\nautomotive unit cost reductions.\nSo that's my mandate. Again, I'm happy to be here. And Elon, if you've got nothing else, we go to Q&A.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. Actually, I guess one other point that's sort of interesting to note is that Tesla is approximately\ndoubling its cumulative sales every year. So this is -- I'm not sure if this has happened in the car industry\nfor maybe a century. But like we started the beginning of last year with 50,000 cars en route, then we\nended with 100,000. This year, we're maybe 60% to 80%. So if we're at the high end of that range, we\nagain sort of potentially double the size of the fleet. And I just think that's pretty exciting and unusual.\nSo thank you. We'll go to Q&A.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nAll right. Latiff, let's take the first question, please.TESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nQuestion and Answer\n...................................................................................................................................................................."

    {
        "paragraph4": "Our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nWelcome, Jason. Just want to ask a couple of questions revolving around the cash flow. I'm sure that\npeople will go into some of the X ramp and delivery numbers. First, you produced about 14,000. You\ndelivered 17,000 vehicles. That would imply 3,443 reduction in new finished goods, at least the S\ninventory, which could generate $250 million. Yet your inventory is roughly flat quarter-over-quarter.\nWhat's -- what, before we get the K and the Q, are the puts and takes there?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nI think you touched on it. We managed to do a really nice job of selling inventory cars at the end of the\nyear.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nBut on the balance sheet, the inventory number -- and cash and inventory stayed about the same.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSo there's a couple of things going on in there. So one is the finished goods but also -- doing a nice job on\nthe finished goods inventory but also just the ramp-up of the parts that we need to get full production with\nModel X.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nOkay. So it's sort of the work in process on the X. Second, can you kind of just refresh -- can you kind of\nupdate us given the change from the revolver to the ABL? What is currently drawn on the ABL? What's\nthe available borrowing base? How much of that is, as you think about next year, going to be used to\nsupport increased on-balance sheet leasing versus increases in finished goods inventory? And what's your\nremaining, if the banks were to come in kind of borrowing base that would be left unpledged?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. So on where we closed Q4 at, I think we were $135 million fully drawn on it. And then in terms\nof the borrowing base, there's a lot of detailed numbers behind that. I think the most important thing to\npoint out here is the increase to $1 billion that we did with our banking partners. And then there are some\nrestrictions there, and we don't want to max that out. So we're going to monitor it carefully and just make\nsure we do the things to do. We don't want to live on this drug.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, and I mean, we have a collection of lenders. So it's like if hypothetically one lender were to get --\nwere to decide not to split the ABL, then would distribute it. So it's not a single currency. And we found\nthat the appetite with lenders is very strong for the ABL because it's a finished product that's going to\na known customer. So it's not -- there's no -- sort of there's no channel to stuff because there isn't a\nchannel. So it's just up in transit to customers, primarily overseas.TESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes. It grows with the inventory balance...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nAgainst cars that have orders placed against them.\nBrian Arthur Johnson\nBarclays PLC, Research Division\nBut it sounds like you could draw -- even if inventory, finished goods inventory, was flat, you could -- could\nyou still draw on it? Or does it have to track to a direct increase in finished goods inventory?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. Yes, it does track to finished goods inventory. Basically, it's a finished goods loan."

        "paragraph5": "Our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer.\nColin William Rusch\nOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division\nSo you're coming to, in the next couple quarters, to the end of some of the initial leases on the Model Ss.\nCan you talk a little bit about your preparations for that and your expectations as we move throughout this\nyear on what will happen with those cars and how many of them are actually going to get returned?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nSure. Jon, do you want to talk about that?\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales and Service\nSure. So we actually started on that early and launched the campaign in the second half of 2015 to reach\nout to folks who had cars coming off lease. And one of the attractive things to those folks who were\ncoming off a lease is have a car that's equipped with Autopilot. And Autopilot is certainly one of the core\nstories of what's going on here at Tesla. It's really exciting. And so we're finding that folks are willing to\nupgrade their Tesla as part of this campaign. And so we've got this formal program where we're really\nproviding a smooth transition period for these cars. In addition to that, we're finding there's a very healthy\naftermarket for these cars. And the trade-in values, or the trading values in the market are significantly\nabove our residual reserves on the cars, which is giving us some flexibility in terms of our financing\npartners offering very attractive monthly payments and loan terms because the cars are holding -- the\nTeslas are holding value at a much higher rate than we thought. So I think the short answer is we're out\nahead of it, and we're getting really good reception and conversion from customers. We're excited about\neven next generation of Tesla, which is an Autopilot-equipped car.\nColin William Rusch\nOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nOkay, great. And then just the follow-up. There's some pretty significant legislation update in the Toxic\nSubstances Control Act that passed through the Congress in December. As you guys look at a lot of the\ndetails in terms of ramp in the Gigafactory, can you talk a little bit about where you're seeing as the\nimpact so far with the updated substances and how they might be treated as we go forward here?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nThis is J.B. I can jump in there. We haven't seen any immediate impacts from those results or changes.\nThe materials we're using at the Gigafactory are not particularly toxic substances. They're...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. The Gigafactory have 0 toxic output.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes, it's -- so in terms of large industrial factories, it's an incredibly clean one. In terms -- there's really no\nemission -- no air emissions and the raw materials are largely base metals and things like that."

        "paragraph6": "Our next question comes from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nTwo quick ones. First, can you confirm reports that Jim Keller, kind of a legend in the microprocessor\nworld, has joined the company to head hardware engineering at Tesla Autopilot? And if that's correct, does\nthat signal that Tesla might be moving to design some of their own silicone?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, I mean, I think it's public knowledge that Jim Keller has joined. I mean we have a lot of talented\npeople that join Tesla all the time. I mean Jim is an indicator of that, and just some will get a bit more\npress than others. But it's -- I think the talent level that's joining Tesla is really incredible. It's -- with\nregards to the latter part of your question, we just -- no comment, yes.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nOkay. And then just a follow-up. On test drives, outside of company-sponsored events, kind of surprised\nwe haven't seen any full comprehensive independent test drives in the major magazines. Is there anything\nkind of preventing -- and I think people on the call can understand if there would be of the earlier\nproduced units that maybe you wouldn't want released quite yet. But is there anything preventing the\nmagazines from gaining access to the early vehicles, the Model Xs, conducting a full road test of the\nvehicle? And if there is, when can we expect kind of some of the first reviews do you think?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, we -- I mean, I guess we've not provided cars to the media because -- largely because we -- to\nthe degree that we could suppress demand for the X, we did. So we took basically every action we could\nto suppress demand for the X because production wasn't -- we needed to get production up. There was\nno point in amplifying demand if the production cannot meet that demand. So we did our best to really\nsuppress demand or certainly not encourage demand. That will obviously change in the balance of this\nyear as we get cars to stores because there have been no Model Xs at the stores, no Model Xs available\nfor test drives. And -- but I mean, in the coming months, I think probably next month, you'll start seeingTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nsuch things, some reviews in magazines and whatnot. The feedback from customers we've gotten has\nbeen very positive."

        "paragraph7": "Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA.\nEmmanuel Rosner\nCLSA Limited, Research Division\nI wanted to ask you first, can you give us a little more color on what exactly happened with the Q4\nlaunch? I mean, in the letter, you sort of like implied that it sort of like took maybe a little bit longer than\nexpected. So what sort of, like, issues have you encountered? And what have you learned that sort of\nlike gives you confidence that in your next launch, maybe the Model 3, you can actually ramp that up\nsignificantly quicker?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, I think that's a great question. I think the statement we made with the Model X, which I really think\nwe've taken to heart at Tesla, is that we put too many new features and technologies, too many great\nthings all at once into a product. In retrospect, it would have been a better decision to do fewer things\nwith the first version of Model X and then roll in the capabilities and features and new technologies over\ntime in subsequent years. So I do think that there were some hubris there with the X. So the net result,\nhowever, is that I think the Model X is an amazing car. I honestly think it's probably the best. I mean, I\nthink it's the best car ever. I'm not sure anyone's going to make a car like this again. I'm not sure Tesla\nwould make a car like this again. So yes, I mean, I'd be surprised if -- if somebody buys the X, and\nparticularly as the software gets refined, if it's not the product they love more than any product they've\never bought, I would be surprised.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. I mean, maybe it's worth also just commenting that even some of the most innovative features on X\nthat caused some challenges in Q4 have really been largely overcome today.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, that's true.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nThe operation of the falcon door, the sourcing and supply of the large glass windscreen, I mean, these\nthings are working very well and are not a bottleneck at this point.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nExactly. But some of the things that cause those issues are somewhat counterintuitive. They're not the\nobvious things. I mean, for at least a few weeks, I mean, maybe 3 or 4 weeks actually, the constraint was\nthe chrome finish on the bright work around the window, the front window, okay. And you think like how\non earth could that be the constraint, but it was...\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nOr seals.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nOr seals, yes. The seals are -- yes, the seals have been really huge bane [ph]. Essentially, the seals had\nto be redesigned. And then the seals that we did have had to be worked by hand in order to sort of fit\ncorrectly. Yes, seals are a bane. We had a lot of issues with obviously secondary seat. We've now in-\nsourced that capability. Yes, we really don't see any fundamental issues.\nEmmanuel Rosner\nCLSA Limited, Research Division\nOkay. So it sounds like it's basically mostly behind you. So as we move forward into the year, so you're\ntalking about this Model X production rate of 1,000 vehicles a week in Q2, is that an exit rate? Or is that\nan average for Q2? And can you just more generally give us how you see the overall mix for the year of S\nversus X play out in terms of deliveries?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI mean some of the stuff is there. You have as good a crystal ball as we do. But the -- let's see, the --\n1,000 a week would probably be a peak production week in Q2. So like average, I don't know what the\naverage is going to be exactly, but maybe 700 or 800, something like that. So that's good for that. I think\nwe feel confident of hitting 1,000 a week certainly towards the mid to end of Q2. And then for the exact\nmix, I mean, I think we need to see how customers react when both cars are in the showrooms, and then\nwe'll adjust accordingly. But we expect the combined delivery number average over the year of 1,600 to\n1,800 per week."

        "paragraph8": "Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nCan you just kind of walk through what are the key short-term drivers? Because you're still -- of cash, I'm\nsorry -- kind of still burning $200 million this quarter. Is it just really all volume to get back to get cash\nflow positive by Q2? You also touched on CapEx. Do you have it -- you're saying it's going to be flat to\ndown, but there's -- it seems like there's an awful lot of work going on in the company. I mean, how do\nyou keep CapEx down as you have all these growth plans?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. So the key drivers on cash flow positive. So as I said in my earlier comments, it's a great step\nin that operations, the business is selling cars and energy products is now producing enough cash for us to\nstart to pay for our investments. And if you look at the Q4 dynamics, that cash flow from core operations,\nas we're calling it, produced 40% to 45% of the cash that we needed for the CapEx in the quarter. So\nthat is certainly a big piece of it, too. Another piece of it, as I mentioned, is just going to be operating\nleverage. We need to be very diligent about how we grow operating costs, certainly. And then the other\nbig element to it is certainly continuing to drive cost downs on the vehicles, and there's lots of ways to do\nthat. We're getting better at our manufacturing processes. We're reducing scrap. We're reducing excess\nand obsolescence. As we talk about in the letter, the car continues to be more and more reliable. So that\nreduces our warranty, and that actually has a cash impact when the cars show up less at the service\ncenters.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. In fact, can I -- I'd just like to reemphasize that. We are seeing dramatic improvements in reliability\nand reductions in servicing needs. This is important. Sorry, go on.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nYes, yes. No, absolutely. And then the other piece, you talked about CapEx and how can it be down. Well,\nwe made a bulk of the investments that we need for Model X in 2015. So in '16, we're going to continue to\ninvest, but we'll really, towards the back half of the year, start to see some initial investment in Model 3.\nWe'll continue to invest in the Gigafactory to get to where we want to be with production there. And then\nwe'll continue to expand the service center, the retail locations and the Supercharger network as well. But\nthere's a lot of the big pieces that we needed to spend in CapEx to get to where we are today were spent\nin the past, yes.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. And I think it's just important to bear in mind that the overall market for SUVs and sedans is roughly\nthe same. So there are -- globally, it's split almost 50-50. And so the X is kind of like half of our volume.\nAnd so if you set a company up to produce X and -- let me use -- not use the variable X. If you set a\ncompany up to produce a certain amount of revenue and then it produces maybe just over half that\namount of revenue but has the cost base associated with it, but then obviously, the -- things will not be\npretty from a cash flow and profitability standpoint. Necessarily, this is going to be true. But then as the X\nproduction rises, then that changes, then we achieve the target revenue with the reasonable cost bases,\nand the whole picture changes dramatically for profitability and cash flow.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nAbsolutely. And the only other last thing I would add, too, is we've had a significant run-up investment\nover the last couple of years. Now it's time to absorb that and look for just greater capital efficiency.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nGot it. And just one final question. Sorry, just one final question. Can you just remind us if we're -- are\nyou still on track for storage of 400 million to 500 million this year and 2 to 5 next year? Or is that on\ntrack?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI mean, J.B., do you want comment on that? I mean, it's -- I mean, one thing I can say with respect to\nenergy, like we do see this being a very enormous market. But we're -- it's an exponential growth market.\nSo exactly where the calendar falls on the S-curve exponential makes quite a big difference on revenue.\nSo it will be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. J.B., do you want to add anything?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes, that's exactly right. I mean, it's not a linear extrapolation throughout this year at all. So I think\nwe're being fairly cautious in trying to make sure that we don't overpromise here and understand what's\ngoing to happen in Q4. It's a little bit tricky to know how that will grow. Production is on track. We feel\nreally good about that. Production started off as planned in the Gigafactory in Q4. Deliveries are on track,\nand we're starting shipments of Powerwalls and Powerpacks worldwide. And we're growing out the sales\noperations, and the sales teams are on their work. So from an execution point of view, I think we feel\nreally good with where we're at. It's just it's early days to predict how exactly that exponential growth is\ngoing to really integrate."

Can you just tell us, what is the current run rate of X\nproduction, where we stand today towards the middle of February? And can we talk a little bit about how\nyou get to that ramp? I mean, it sounds like 1,000 is the target that would obviously mathematically get\nyou to think about half your production. So that's pretty much full ramp, but it seems like that's a pretty\nbig distance from where you are now. And maybe we can walk through the pieces that gets you there in\nterms of training employees, getting the supply base in order, getting some of the quality issues resolved.\nThat would be my first question.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI mean, I don't think we want to comment with that level of granularity but -- because unless people\nactually understand how production works, they will reach incorrect conclusions. I mean, we want to stick\nto what our projections are and leave it at that.\nPatrick Kenehan Archambault\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nOkay. I guess just in terms of another ramp-oriented question, if I may. It does seem that given the\nforecast that you have for, I think, 16,000 deliveries this year, getting to...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nThis quarter.\nPatrick Kenehan Archambault\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nAssuming 80 -- for this quarter, excuse me, getting to 80,000 to 90,000 would imply a run rate that's\nabout 40% higher than where you are in Q1. But you also made a comment that inventories may -- that\na lot of that is going to be international and there may be some in-process inventory being built out to\nservice that. So maybe we can talk a little bit about that ramp.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, the international stuff is mostly Q2. So that's really when the international ramp starts. There's still\ninventory in process for, of course, North America because it takes longer to get a car to the East Coast,\nparticularly for like a blizzard or something. But -- so that's, to me, a factor in finished goods. But finished\ngoods necessarily ramps as we fill the pipeline for overseas sales, which is next quarter."

Hopefully, I'm not getting the numbers wrong, but it seems\nlike 20% growth in 2016 versus 2015 implies like relatively flat versus the Q4 run rate. Is that achievable\nto essentially keep the operating expenses pretty consistent throughout 2016?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nYes, certainly. This is Jason. Yes, we definitely believe that we can do that. There was a bit of a dog's\nbreakfast in Q4. We had some things in there. I'll just give you a couple of examples. So we had some\naged receivables from some service revenues in Europe that we ended up having to write off. That was\none thing. We had some R&D tooling that had come to the end of its useful life that we had to write off asTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nwell. So there's some noise in the Q4 number, for sure, but I'm very confident in the projection and the\nforecast that we've given for 2016 relative to 2015.\nDaniel Galves\nCr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\nOkay, great. Yes, yes, no problem. And one other, if I could. There's been a lot of negative chatter about\nGigafactory related to signing up of other partners, precursor partners, supply agreements for access\nto raw materials and just kind of the general size of the plant. I was wondering if you could give us an\nupdate on kind of where you stand and if you see any challenges to get up to the 35 gigawatt hours of cell\nproduction by 2020, 50 of packs.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nSure. I mean, generally, relative to the initial forecast and time lines, we feel pretty comfortable on where\nwe're at. I think there has been a lot of drama and a lot of negativity in the reporting on this, and some\naround the headcount recently that I think a lot of people picked up on. And maybe just to talk about that\none in particular, that recent sort of hiring headcount discussion cued off of numbers that we reported that\nwere effective essentially in the middle of 2015. And then those were essentially compared against where\nwe had predicted to be at the end of 2015. So they weren't really even really apples to apples. In our\nvery -- most recent reports that we made with the Governor's Office of Economic Development, we had\nreported, I think, around 272 net hires for the year at the end of 2015 against what -- we had a target of\n300. So I mean, the general plan is, I guess, getting actually quite closely to what we had laid out back in\n2014. I think because it's a fast growth, we have to be really careful at what snapshot in time you actually\nlook at and what you compare that against. But we still have the same confidence. We're still on track to\nproduce 15 gigawatt hours of cells and -- I'm sorry, 35 gigawatt hours of cells and 50 gigawatt hours of\npacks, 15 of that going to Tesla Energy, the rest going to Model 3 and vehicles. That still is on track, and\nwe're on track to start cell production at the -- toward the end of this year.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nBasically, I think as to the best of our knowledge, you should not worry about the Gigafactory as a\nconstraint for Model 3. That is -- does not appear to be anywhere near the critical path for Model 3. So --\nand if I can just sort of maybe say a few words about the Gigafactory and like Nevada and the incentives\nand all that. One of the most bothersome things that I see in the media is sort of overrepresentation\nof the Nevada incentives. The thing to bear in mind for the $1.3 billion in incentives for Nevada is that\nin order for us to achieve that, we have to develop about $100 billion in revenue from the Gigafactory.\nAnd those incentives occur over 20 years, representing approximately a 1% discount on the cost of the\nGigafactory. The reason it's a big number, and I should say it does proportion -- it is a big number in the\nabsolute terms, but it is disproportionately small relative to incentives, let's say, Boeing would receive for\nkeeping an aircraft factory in Washington. The reason it's this big is because the Gigafactory will be the\nlargest footprint building in the world when it is done. Our Tesla Fremont factory is currently #2. And if\nyou're curious, #1 is a flower auction house in the Netherlands. And you can look this up on Wikipedia.\nSo it sort of makes sense that if something is kind of like the biggest thing on earth, it's probably going to\nhave incentives that are maybe big in the absolute but small in relative terms. And the fundamental driver\nof the decision that -- not the exclusive driver but the primary driver of the decision was pace of execution\nfor the Gigafactory. That was the primary reason for Nevada over other options. And that -- I believe that\nthis decision is bearing fruit because we are seeing it move at a very good pace.\nDaniel Galves\nCr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division\nWelcome, Jason. Sorry.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial OfficerTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nAll of those incentives are also performance-based.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, exactly.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nWe don't receive them unless we execute along the path toward the milestones.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nRight, and even some of those we do receive have clawback provision.\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nExactly.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI mean, essentially, like I wrote a blog about this, there is no way for Nevada to lose. The way that Nevada\nset up the incentive structure is it is a no-lose proposition for them. So they did an awesome job on behalf\nof the state. I mean you can read the blog that I wrote called The House Always Wins, which is true, and\nso -- anyway, it's really annoying to see this stuff misrepresented in the press."

I mean, as you\nget...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nMaybe I'm biased, obviously.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nWell, yes, I mean, it's your newest car, so it makes sense -- your newest vehicle, I should say, so it\nmakes sense. But I mean, as you look at getting that production ramped up and availability out there\nto consumers, what would the selling point be on the Model S then? I mean, could you get this mix\nsignificantly above 50% crossovers or Model X because the price premium is really not that great? Why\nwouldn't you sell a whole lot more Model X than Model S? And could you?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, I think this is a question of owner preference. I mean, I personally still prefer to drive the Model\nS over the X because I'm kind of a -- I like the lower position of a sedan. And the S, in terms of\nperformance, is about 10% better in an acceleration or handling or whatnot than the X. So it really\ndepends on optimization. If you like sort of a high seating position, like an amazing amount of room\nand functionality and just sort of the feeling of high visibility like -- I mean, because the -- one of theTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nbest features, maybe the best feature, of the X is the cockpit-style front windshield, which gives you this\namazing panoramic view as you're driving. And so like if -- which, like, a lot of people like that in an SUV,\nand so that's the reason that they buy that. So I think it really depends on personal preference. And we'll\nsee what the results are once we actually put the vehicle in the stores and people take test drives.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nAnd when you think about all the content that you're putting in the X and the upgradability of the S and\nthe X over time, I mean, how do you think about planned obsolescence, which is sort of a real necessary\npart of almost any business to generate incremental sales from your existing customer base?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI guess I -- I mean, our view of planned -- we don't plan to obsolete things. We just relentlessly make\nthings better. So for example, for the S, there's an average of 20 improvements per week. Most of these\nare little tiny nuance things that most people wouldn't notice, but it is a continuous improvement process.\nThat's why I say when people say, well, when should they buy Model S, like what model year, it's like\nwe don't really have model years. We keep improving the car. If you want to wait until the car stops\nimproving, you'll be waiting forever.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nOkay. And then just one follow-up just on the cash flow for 2016. Obviously, a lot of progress has been\nmade more recently. As we think about the positive net cash flow and the increase in the cash balance on\na year-over-year basis, will that include -- I'm just trying to be clear -- the potential draw on the ABL over\ntime as that's needed to run the business?

And it's clearly going to be volume dependent and sort of timing around the launch.\nBut I was wondering if you could help us understand. Just given that it's 1/3 of the transaction price of\nroughly your initial Model X deliveries, what are some of the efficiencies you're hoping that you can sort\nof draw upon maybe beyond just sort of the battery reduction -- battery cost reductions? What are you\nleveraging in the Model 3 from investments you've already made and sort of the knowledge you have\naround sort of initial launch costs and the higher-price vehicles at this point?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, I think the way to think of the cost difference is really that the Model 3, being a sedan, is about 20%\nlighter than -- and actually quite a bit less complex to manufacture than the Model S. The Model S was\nreally the first car we ever made ourselves. So it was -- we were designing to make it work as opposed\nto designing it from ease of manufacturing, whereas the 3 is really designed for ease of manufacturing.\nAnd then we expect, through economies of scale and just general design improvements, to get another\n30% improvement. So that's where the 50% improvement comes relative to the S. So sort of 35k versusTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\n70k of 3 versus S is the way to think about the difference. And our default plan, as we've done in the past,\nis that the initial sales are relatively highly optioned versions of the car because, obviously, we've got to\npay back the investment of all the tooling and everything. So that sort of makes sense to have the higher-\noptioned versions first. So that's what we did with the S and obviously, again with the X. While it was sort\nof unfortunate that -- of the way the X pricing got reported that they reported the sort of fully optioned\nsignature series as though it was the base price volume number in some publications. So this was just\na misunderstanding of how things work. I mean, it's -- and I think it's also normal procedures in many\nother industries like for -- if Intel comes out with a new CPU or faster CPU or NVIDIA comes out with a\nnew graphics card, the -- in the beginning, it's a lot more expensive. And then over time, the price drops.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\nJust a clarification, Elon, on the economies of scale. It's sort of -- should I think about that and sort of the\n-- running through the paint shop as an example, given you said 10,000 unit per week sort of goal there?\nAnd then separately, what could we expect -- or when should we expect to start hearing about the Model\n3 production line? Where do you, within the facility, plan to build it, at what point? Is it sort of going to be\nthe same lead time as we saw with the Model X?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, but I mean, there will be a production ramp for the 3. It's always been tricky in the past to predict\nthose production ramps, but yes, yes. You guys want to add?\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nI think in the development plan that we have now, we have substantially more time and placeholders\nput into the schedule to really refine the product ahead of the production ramp.

Do you think that those vehicles\nultimately go to different customers? Or is there a plan to avoid cannibalization there?\nElon R.

And you\nshould think of the Model 3 as sort of sort of -- for really competing in kind of the BMW 3 Series or Audi\nA4 market, and so if you want the sort of ultimate machine, you'd really want to get the Model S. But the\nModel 3 will be a great car.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes.

Are\nyou expecting them to be able to stay above 25% even with the Model X ramping?\nJason S. Wheeler\nFormer Chief Financial Officer\nSure. So as we said in the letter, 25% by the end of the year for Model X -- sorry, I'm a little under the\nweather -- and 30% for the Model S. So you can do the math on what the blended rate will look like. In\nterms of getting to 25% for Model X, we have to think about it as we've got many years of history with\nthe Model S right now. And that is learning that can certainly be applied to what we're doing with Model X.\nSo we're comfortable that we're going to be able to drive gross margin in the right direction with Model X\nsignificantly throughout the year.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. And I mean, in the long run, we expect the gross margins of S and X to converge around the 30%\nnumber. So they should, in the long run, both be around 30%. That's our target. It's just -- as Jason was\nsaying, because the X is the newer vehicle, we're just earlier on the learning curve for the X than the S.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nOkay. It sounds looks like it's not -- you're benefiting from some learning curves. So the margins, even\ninitially, could be, okay, north of the 20% range.

But you'll see service centers and retail locations opening\nacross all of our markets, including Europe."

        "paragraph18": "Our next question comes from Mike Ramsey of The Wall Street Journal.\nMike Ramsey\nI guess I was hoping that maybe you can kind of give me an encapsulating feeling on the quarter. What\n-- it's sort of a mixed bag from an outsider's perspective. The losses are -- were pretty high and maybe\nhigher than what people expected. But you're giving a very aggressive forecast. Do you feel like the\ncompany is on the right track and that you're past some of your hiccups? I guess I'm looking for a 40,000-\nfoot analysis.\nElon R. MuskTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, I feel very good about things right now. I mean, it was -- the last several months have been quite\nexcruciating, I'd say. I mean, many late nights and weekends, but I think we're through the worst of it at\nthis point.\nMike Ramsey\nOkay. And I had wanted to ask a little bit about also your plans for consolidation. And Dana asked about\nwhether the Gigafactory could handle the Model 3. I'm curious. I haven't been there. There are so many\nfolks working over there now that aren't even building cars. You have engineers and stuff there. Can you\ngive me a little idea about whether and when you might have to think about consolidating your operations\nin the Bay Area?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI'm not sure what you mean by consolidating. We are kind of spread out because in addition to Fremont\n-- the Fremont factory complex and headquarters in Palo Alto, we do have a number of other facilities in\nthe Bay Area. But man, it's -- I'm not sure how we'd consolidate. We'd have to build a really big facility for\nthat.\nMike Ramsey\nSo you might just keep taking over buildings all around, okay. All right.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, I think, man, it's something like the 7 million square feet of real estate at this point around the Bay\nArea, something like that.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes, and we've seen the Gigafactory actually being a kind of helpful pressure outlet for some things in the\nBay Area.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nPlus expansion in the Lathrop, Stockton area.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. We're going the other way."

        "paragraph19": "The next question comes from Dee-Ann Durbin of Associated Press.\nDee-Ann Durbin\nConsidering now that the Chevy Bolt is going to go on sale at the end of this year, so that'll be a full year\nthat it's on sale before Model 3 arrives, does that -- I mean, has it taken any wind out of your sails? And\n-- or do you think, again, that these are very different customers? If you're comparing to an Audi A4, for\nexample, are people still going to be attracted to the Model 3 even though they'll have that option on the\nmarket quite a while before the Model 3 arrives?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nWell, I mean, I would sort of point you to the market share of large luxury vehicles or large premium\nsedan sales in the U.S. that I talked about earlier in the call. We're currently outsell everyone in that\ncategory and had a 51% market growth last year where everyone else declined and the market as a whole\ndeclined. So I mean, if Model 3 is at all similar in its market segment, it doesn't seem like we're going to\nbe demand constrained.\nDee-Ann Durbin\nOkay. And I know you don't do any marketing, but I'm wondering if you would ever possibly reconsider\nthat. It struck me when you were saying that you aren't where you could be on the East Coast and that\nmay be because people need more educating about how the car performs in the snow or whatever, do you\nthink there's ever a point at which you might reconsider and do some very targeted marketing in places\nwhere you think you could do better?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, I don't think it's in the near -- I don't think we'd do that in the near term. But in the long term, I\nthink I could see us doing advertising where that advertising was interesting, entertaining and people\ndon't regret seeing it, which unfortunately, is not the case for most advertising. So I mean, if there's sort\nof something interesting and artistic or just like you -- it's entertaining, it's like wouldn't waste people's\ntime if they saw it. And also, I think we need to have a more affordable, high-volume car, before that\nmakes sense, like the Model 3, so that it's more accessible. So if we do mass media, then it's more likely\nthat somebody could buy the car. And that's kind of the point when it would be something we'd consider."

        "paragraph20": "Our next question comes from the line of Phil LeBeau of CNBC.\nPhil Lebeau\nElon, I'm curious if you are noticing any impact in terms of reservations, orders in terms of the market\nvolatility that we're seeing, the growing questions about instability in our economy, elsewhere, fall-off in\nthe wealth effect, if you will. Are you guys noticing any slowdown in the pace of orders?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nJon, do you want to...\nJonathan McNeill\nPresident of Global Sales and Service\nYes, I think, Phil, it's a great question. And actually, the answer is no. The demand is very strong. We're\nup significantly over 2014 in the same period. And for both -- for S and X, we -- both the order rate on\nS and the conversion rate to orders on X has been very strong. And we're not seeing that impact at this\npoint in time across really all of our markets, both domestic and international.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. I mean, that said, we don't want to be complacent about demand generation. And as we mentioned,\nthere's a bunch of stores opening that -- in markets where we really haven't had a store or any kind of\nmeaningful store. I mean, our store in Manhattan, you basically need to be shown like almost to find it.\nSo unless you hunt us down, you won't find the store. I think we obviously need to change that and put\nstores where people are likely to encounter them, kind of like a fishing boat or something. It's like you just\ndon't -- you want to be where the fish are. It's like not in some sort of random barren location. So that's\nkind of what we're doing. So we're not complacent about demand. And just in case we see things take a\nturn for the worse, we want to overshoot on demand generation by our stores.\nJeff EvansonTESLA, INC. FQ4 2015 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 10, 2016\nVice President of Investor Relations\nAll right, everyone, that concludes the Q&A session of the call. Thank you so much for joining us today,\nand we look forward to seeing you all in the future.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. Thanks, everyone."
