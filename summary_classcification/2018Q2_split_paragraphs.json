First of all, I'd like to say, we're incredibly proud of the Tesla team for producing 7,000 Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles in the last week of June. Those were amazing efforts. So honored to work with such great team to fuse that incredible result. It's like mind-blowing. We continued to achieve 5,000 Model 3s per week, 7,000 combined S, X and 3, multiple weeks in July, showing that we're able to do this on a sustained basis. And we expect to, in the absence of a force majeure or some very unexpected events, be able to achieve an average of 5,000 Model 3s or above for Q3, and 2,000 Model 3, Model S, X or above per week for Q3 as well. So essentially, 7,000 cars a week, plus for -- on average for Q3. So it's an amazing jump from only a year ago when we're producing 2,000 vehicles a week. It's really kind of a mind-blowing leap forward for a manufacturing company. So yes, it's incredible work by the"

The results you're seeing is that the Model 3 market share has surpassed all competitor premium, mid- sized sedans combined. So Model 3 market share is now a majority. July was a majority of all premium sedans. That trend is, we think, likely to continue. So it's not -- we do not think it will stop there. I have Robin Ren here, who's our worldwide Head of Sales, to talk about some of the interesting elements that we're seeing in terms of cars that people are trading in, the sales and demand trends. It's looking really, really positive. We're also getting great feedback from Model 3 from our customers, and we're now delivering the performance dual-motor and all-wheel drive versions. And the Model 3 reviews are outstanding, really couldn't ask for better reviews from some of the toughest critics in the world. And it's -- yes, and just the thing that we're recognizing is that the more Model 3s we deliver to the field, it's actually causing viral growth of our sales. So we deliver our Model 3 to somebody,"

We'll try to raise that rate of Model 3 production steadily in the coming quarters and try to get to the 10,000 cars a week number as soon we can. What we've found, as we spent a lot of time debugging a wide range manufacturer issues, is that the potential for our existing lines to be able to produce far more cars is much greater than expected. That by simplifying production lines, by speeding them up, by, in some cases, having things being done manually instead of automatic, and in other cases having be done automatic instead of manual, we've been able to achieve dramatic improvements to the output of existing lines, which means that our CapEx growing from 5,000 cars a week to 10,000 cars a week is a tiny fraction.

Peter Bannon Sure. So like 2 years ago, when I joined Tesla, we did a survey of all of the solutions that were out there for running neural networks, including GPUs.

Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Well, thanks. Yes, I mean, essentially, the key is to be able to run the neural net at a fundamental -- at a bare metal level so that you're -- in the circuits, especially when you're the calculations in the circuits itself and not in some sort of emulation mode, which is how a GPU or CPU would operate. So you want to do basically a mass amount of localized matrix calculations with the memory right there. So it's a huge number of very simple complications with the memory"

Our current hardware, which I'm a big fan of NVIDIA, they're great stuff, but using a GPU, primarily, it's an emulation mode. So -- and you also get choked on the bus. So the transfer between the GPU and the CPU ends up being one that constrains the system. So the net effect is we're able to, with the Tesla computer, we've been in like semi-stealth mode basically for the last 2 to 3 years on this, but I think it's probably time to let the cat out of the bag because that -- the cat's coming out of the bag anyway.

But certainly, when spooling up the production line, there are tremendous amount of inefficiencies. There's a lot of hurry up and wait where some parts of the production line move well and one part doesn't. And we have associates waiting around with nothing to do. There are parts that we thought were right but then it turns out we've got -- they weren't right and then we send it back to the supplier. It's just like the whole sort of giant machine kind of -- you just need to have to lurch into a high pace. And there's a lot of lurching, which is very inefficient.

Do you want to add to that? Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer No, you described it extremely well. So just to sort of summarize, this was a major milestone for us in Q2 that the gross margin in Model 3 turned slightly positive. And we feel really good about the path ahead. And as Elon said, it's driven predominantly by manufacturing cost efficiencies. It's the labor hours that we use to produce each car becomes less, the initial ramp up costs that we have that are one-time as those inefficiencies disappear. Our fixed cost that are there, that gets leveraged to a higher volume. So all of that. Elon R.

And Q3 also benefits with somewhat improved mix as we're going to sell more all-wheel drive and performance cars.

And one of the great challenges [indiscernible] there need to be a lot more electricians. So we actually had an electrician training program. We're going to actually have to fast-train new people who've never been electricians before to be electricians because otherwise, [indiscernible] there's not enough electrician capacity in the United States and most places in the world to install Powerwalls. And so we'd have to actually literally train electricians and like it takes like 2 years basically before somebody is certified to be an electrician. So it sounds like, okay, we [ obviously ] can't grow faster than the rates and number of electricians who can physically install Powerwalls. That's like one of the limitations. Jeffrey B.

Straubel Chief Technology Officer The car business is still much bigger as we sit here today, but the growth rate on energy is faster. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect Yes, if you extrapolate energy growth rate -- well, obviously if you extrapolate anything; triple for a year, pretty soon becomes size of your universe.
