        "paragraph2": "As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.\nI'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jeff Evanson, Head of Investor Relations. Sir,\nplease begin.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's third quarter Q&A webcast. I'm\njoined today by Elon Musk, Tesla's Chairman and CEO; J.B. Straubel, our CTO; and Deepak Ahuja, Tesla's\nCFO.\nOur Q3 results are announced in the shareholder letter at the same link as this webcast. As usual, this\nletter includes GAAP and non-GAAP financial information and reconciliations between the 2.\nDuring our call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These are\nbased on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due\nto a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent Form 10-Q filed with\nthe SEC.\nAnd now Liz, let's go to the first question, please.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nSure, I can probably...\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nOh, do you have some...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI can [indiscernible] to make some comments.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nYes, actually, Liz, we'll have our CEO, Elon, make some initial comments. Go ahead, Elon.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI just wanted to note that we've made 2 fairly significant hires, the first of which is Jason Wheeler. He\nwill be our CFO starting next month. Deepak and Jason will be working closely together for the first\nfew months to have a smooth transition. And once again, I'd like to thank Deepak for his awesome\ncontribution to Tesla.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nThank you, Elon.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectTESLA, INC. FQ3 2015 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 03, 2015\nAnd so Jason comes to us from Google, where we was basically #2 finance guy at Google responsible for\ntheir global finance function, and I just thought he was the super smart guy and really understood what\nwe're doing and was like a very cultural fit with the company. So I think that's going to be great.\nAnd then, in addition, Jon McNeill has joined as Head of Global Sales And Service. And Jon is the former\nCEO of Enservio. He's been named sort of Most Admired CEO in the small and mid-size company category.\nIn fact, I believe, this is the first time in maybe a decade or more that Jon actually has not been head of\nthe company that he was working at, so -- and before Enservio, he co-founded Sterling Collision, which --\nwhere, he was able to reduce industry repair times by 90%. So the average repair time went from 18 days\nto less than 2 days while growing the business at 40% a year. So I think Jon's an awesome addition to the\nteam as well. And he's actually -- he's been doing great. He's been working now part time at Tesla for a\nfew months and just started full time and has already done a lot of good.\nSo I'm pretty excited about those 2 people joining the team, and we expect to have some additional\nannouncements in the months to come as we add bench strength to the Tesla management team.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nOkay. Thank you, Elon. All right, Liz, why don't we go to the first caller, please?TESLA, INC.

        "paragraph3": "Our first question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nOh, great. In the press release, you seem to address this a little bit, but there has been a lot of chatter\nabout cancellations for orders for the X, I mean -- and I think the press release says Signature Series. Is\nthat across the models? And how should we think about the different versions of the X rolling out over the\nnext couple of quarters?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYou want to talk to that?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, I don't think there's been anything fundamentally different. I mean, so far, on the Signature Series\nModel X, we've seen a much higher -- or a higher conversion rate than we had seen on the [indiscernible]\nlaunched S. So overall, the demand for the X, after the launch of the X, and -- has been higher. So I -- we\ndon't see any fundamental issues.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, I mean, as we've talked about before, really, the main thing with the X is just scaling up production.\nWe're making steady progress with each passing week. Actually, I -- 7 days a week, every day, I get an\nupdate on manufacturing progress and what the issues are. And we see no fundamental issues on the\nproduction ramp. It's just a question of how quickly we can solve each issue. And they're really down\nto like the little things, like the placement of the seal on the door and whether that results in the bright\ntrim [ph] alignment being correct. This is quite nuanced. So we feel very confident at being able to get to\nseveral hundred vehicles per week by the end of the year.\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nOkay. And can you give an update on stationary storage? Is that still trending to your target of 2 to 5\nbillion [ph] by 2017? And I think the release mentioned that there are some institutional orders. I mean,\nare there any noteworthy orders that you would want to call out in -- on the storage side that we should\nkind of look at as being big drivers? And are you still confident in your sort of 15% gross margin for that\n[indiscernible]?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nSo that was like a whole bunch of questions. The -- with respect to stationary storage, I mean, the --\nthat is, again, sort of a production limited thing. So we're trying to scale our production as much as\npossible. I mean, we've -- by almost any metric -- we're -- if we imagine the most we could possibly\nmake in 2016, we've already sold out of that. Or at least, if you were to take even a small fraction of\nthe number of people that have placed orders and assume that those orders are valid, even if a small\nportion of those are valid, we would be sold out of all of 2016 production, maybe well into 2017. So\nit's really mostly about predicting our production rate, and yes, we expect very dramatic increases in\nthe stationary storage production. The reason I feel a bit cautious about giving exact estimates is that\nwhen you have an exponential increase, the exact calendar window over which the -- that you place thatTESLA, INC. FQ3 2015 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 03, 2015\nexponential, has quite a big impact on the numbers. So -- and in fact, in general, at Tesla, I want to be\na little more cautious about giving quarterly numbers, particularly when we have very dramatic ramps,\nlike the example is with the Model X. You can imagine, if you have strict calendar windows and you place\nthem over the beginning of an exponential, or slightly to the right or slightly more to the right, the actual\ndifferences are quite dramatic. So like you know where it's going to end up, but not what it looks like in\nthat rapidly changing S curve situation. Yes, so...\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nAnd then, on the margins side, is that still on target? And that's it.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nSorry, on the -- you're breaking up a little bit. On the margins?\nColin Langan\nUBS Investment Bank, Research Division\nThe gross margin, is it still at your -- or is it still trending to the 15% target I think you mentioned on the\nlast call?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nOh, 15%, yes. Mostly -- we -- yes, I don't think there's going to be any problem hitting a 15% margin\ntarget. Obviously, the margin improves as the production ramps up, so yes.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes, I don't know if I want to discuss the specific margin targets, but it should be in excess of 15%. That is\nour internal target.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, I mean -- Yes. once you get away from the very early stage of production, I think, long term margin\n15% is no problem."

        "paragraph4": "Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\nGreat. Just a point of clarification, first, on the announcement of the 40,000 vehicles that you rolled the\nAutopilot feature out to over the air. Can you just clarify, once rolled it's out over the air, is there, then, a\npoint at which the consumer has to determine to spend, I think it's $2,500, to activate it? And is there any\ndetail you can provide us on those that are paying to activate the Autopilot feature at this time?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nMost people who ordered the car actually ordered with the Autopilot convenience features. So the\nAutopilot safety features are default on -- in all vehicles. This is automatic emergency braking, side\ncollision avoidance, forward-collision warning, that kind of thing. The convenience features like Autosteer,\nAutopark, are $2,500, but like most people have actually -- had actually already ordered that. So those\nthat hadn't -- haven't ordered it can actually turn it on for -- it's actually slightly more if you get it afterTESLA, INC. FQ3 2015 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 03, 2015\nthe fact, for -- turn it on for $3,000. And that's something that we'll be allowing people to do at some\npoint in the coming months, sort of like an in-app purchase, I guess, yes.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\nOkay, great. Then I wanted to ask a question as it relates to -- now that we're past sort of the, as I\nunderstood it, the peak spending period in advance of the Model X launch, how should we think about\ncapital expenditures and -- or cash flow models for the fourth quarter? And maybe it sounds like you've\nreiterated the positive free cash flow guide you had originally stated earlier this year. But just some\nthoughts as it relates to the cash flows in the fourth quarter would be great.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, I mean, Q4, we are still in the peak of our Model X investments. A lot of our equipment and tooling is\nbeing paid off in Q4, as the production are proving out their production -- sorry, suppliers are proving out\ntheir production tooling as well as the equipment is getting installed and getting signed off in our factory.\nSo Q4 is going to be a peak for Model X. Clearly, 2016 our CapEx should be less than 2015, and then, we'll\nprovide you further guidance on that in the next earnings call.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\nAnd -- oh, sorry, go ahead.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI was going to say like, we do have a -- like a very strong push towards free cash flow. I mean, that is\n-- our aspiration is to be positive -- I need to emphasize, this is an aspiration, not a promise. But our\naspiration is to be positive cash flow in Q1.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division\nUnderstood. Deepak, best of luck, and we look forward to meeting Jason when he's fully ramped and\nonboard.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nThank you, James."

        "paragraph5": "Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nElon, just thinking longer term here. Assuming Tesla establishes itself as a leader in autonomous\ntransport, do you see a business case for selling autonomous cars to ride-sharing firms? Or can Tesla\ncut out the middleman and offer on-demand electric mobility services directly from the company's own\nplatform?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI think we'd have to say no comment.\nAdam Michael JonasTESLA, INC. FQ3 2015 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 03, 2015\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nI mean, Elon, it's kind of unusual for you to punt on strategic questions of a long-term nature. Is this a\ndumb question? Or a funny question?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nNo, I think it's quite a smart question, actually, but there's still no comment.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nWhy -- all right, okay, I won't antagonize. Let's move on. I mean, it's just odd because you normally -- or\nI've never heard you punt like that, that's all. But in any case, is it because of a competitive sensitivity? Or\nis it because the concept itself is just too in-flux?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI think there's a right time to make announcements, and this is not that time.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nFair play. All right can I ask one on Autopilot?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nAnd nor -- I mean, nor is our strategy fully baked here. So to -- for us to state what it would be, it's not\nfully baked. So there's no -- we'd prefer to announce something when it's -- when we're -- we think we've\ngot the full story understood.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nSo saying it's not fully baked implies there's something in the oven, but just, okay.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nOkay, can we -- we kind of need to move on.\nJeff Evanson\nVice President of Investor Relations\nNext question.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nLet's move one. J.B., all right, let's go to J.B. real quick, then. On Autopilot, can you share any early data\nyou might have collected with us post the automated driving software update? How many miles have\nbeen driven with Autopilot engaged? How many accidents prevented? Things like that would be really\ninteresting and, I think, illuminating.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nWell, I don't think we want to share any particular details on specifics around user feedback on that. But\ncertainly, people are using it in a variety of situations. This has gone out to the whole fleet of Autopilot-TESLA, INC. FQ3 2015 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 03, 2015\nenabled cars, and those are racking up miles extremely quickly. At this point, I don't have the exact\nnumber at the tip of my tongue, but it's I believe, several hundred thousand miles of driving, so.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nIt's 1 million a day, at least.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nIt's almost 1 million a day of cars that are -- have Autopilot hardware. So I mean, the early data -- this\nis early data, I would emphasize, is that it's very positive. So we're aware of many accidents that were\nprevented from Autopilot, and we're not aware of any that were caused by Autopilot. That's -- but this is\nstill early, and -- but it's a good indication. So it appears to be quite beneficial from a safety standpoint,\nand I believe, some of our customers have posted videos to this effect."

        "paragraph7": "Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.\nJoseph Robert Spak\nRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nI guess, it's been a while since I've heard anything about this, but I just wanted to get a better sense of\nhow you feel you're set up to deal with the potential issues on the cars on the hardware side, where a fix\ncan't be OTA-ed to the vehicle booth [ph]. Because when you look at the coverage like in the U.S., the\nratio of service centers to stores and galleries is still trailing a little bit. So how does that buildout look\ngoing forward? And how would you potentially handle a hardware situation at this point?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI'm not sure I fully understand your question. So you mean -- can you give an example of...\nJoseph Robert Spak\nRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nIf you had a hardware recall for...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nOh, like, just like -- you mean like -- sure. I mean, we've handled recalls in the past with our service\nteam. It's gone quite well. In general, we try to be proactive, so if we -- without -- well before we're sort\nof forced to do a recall, we proactively try to fix things in the cars that we think might, in the future, be\nan issue. And the customer happiness is -- as measured by the -- really, the key question that I think\npeople should be concerned about, which is, will your next car be a Tesla? That's like the key question on\nconsumer reports. 97% of respondents said that their next car would be a Tesla. Frankly, this is the only\nquestion people should care about.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2015 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 03, 2015\nJoseph Robert Spak\nRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division\nOkay. And then, the -- one more, I guess, sort of hardware question. As it relates to Autopilot, where this\nis clearly stage 1, and you could add sensors over time and maybe some new features as well, so how do\nyou think about managing the brand and the vehicles when that happens? Because as the sensor suite\nchanges, it can create 2 potentially different experiences when -- and I guess, it's a little bit more -- the\nreason I think it's a little bit more of an issue for a Tesla is just you don't have the strict sort of model-year\nnomenclature. So you're not -- so I guess, I just wonder like how you think about that, and maybe some\nthoughts on how -- on your current sensor suite, and how you see that evolving as well.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nOkay. I think those are pretty open-ended questions, but we have a philosophy of just continuous\nimprovements. So every week, there are approximately 20 engineering changes made to the car. So it's\nnot really -- it's not as -- it's not nearly as discrete as you're alluding to. With other manufacturers, they\ntend to sort of bundle everything together in a model year. In our case, it's a series of rolling changes, so\nmodel year doesn't mean as much. There are cases where that step change may be a little higher than\nnormal as, for example, with having the Autopilot camera, radar and ultrasonics. But we try to actually\nthose step changes as small as possible, and so that -- I mean, essentially, like the kind of questions\nthat I get is -- from friends is, \"Hey, when should I buy a Model S?\" And my answer is always, right now,\nbecause -- and they say, \"Well, aren't you going to make a better one in 6 months?\" I'm like, yes, of\ncourse. But if their goal is to only buy a Model S when there aren't significant improvements happening,\nthen they will never buy one."

        "paragraph8": "Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.\nPatrick Kenehan Archambault\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nOkay. Yes, great. A couple of questions, just one on the battery side. I think a lot of us were surprised at\nthe GM Analyst Day. They put a slide up which said that they were working on a battery that was $145\na kilowatt hour. That probably didn't include the pack cost, but even adjusting for that, that seemed like\na pretty low number. And I don't know, maybe J.B., how did you guys react to that presentation? Is it\nrealistic? I mean, are you worried about the threat of a large form-factor battery being the same cost as\nyours within kind of a 1- to 2-year time frame, would be my first question.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nWell, we definitely read the report and we're not terribly concerned about it. I think, also, there was a lot\nof confusion in that particular report and some of the comments following about sell price versus pack\ncost. And in general, we're quite comfortable in our position with the type of cells and the form factors\nwe're using. And we think that's going to be the best cost position and cost road map in the future.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nAnd -- sorry, I apologize, buddy [ph]. I mean, we are constantly agonizing about cell costs and pack\ncosts. And we don't think anyone is on a path to be even close to us. If they are, I would be the first to\ncongratulate them.\nPatrick Kenehan Archambault\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nGot it. Well, that's very helpful and quite reassuring to know. My second question just was on -- in the\npress release, you talked about orders having increased 50% year-on-year. And maybe just a little colorTESLA, INC. FQ3 2015 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 03, 2015\non that. I mean, that's obviously impressive, given the model that's been out there for a few years. Just\nany additional color on regional breakdown or what that's being driven by.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nWe haven't provided that in the past. I think all -- maybe the way to put it is that Europe and APAC were\nreally strong, and...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nAnd so was North America.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd North America. Well, North America has always been strong, and Europe and APAC being strong, too.\nWe were at 50% year-over-year.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, I mean, I'd maybe, quite frankly, look at it the other way around. I think we were actually relatively\nweak in APAC and...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nThat's another way to look at it.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nAnd relatively weak in most countries in Europe, and we're fixing those fundamental weaknesses by\nensuring that we've got a good supercharger infrastructure, a good service center infrastructure, that\nany perceptions about the company are addressed. And in a lot of places, it takes time to build consumer\nconfidence. They need to hear the -- they need to hear about Tesla a lot before they're comfortable\nmaking a significant asset purchase. So...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, it's a matter of the execution by the team, brand awareness and our expansion of our global network.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, so it's -- but I wouldn't say, it's not like, really -- I mean, all regions have improved quite significantly.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes.\nPatrick Kenehan Archambault\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division\nGot it, helpful. If I can squeeze one last one in really quickly. On the topic of Autopilot, there were some\nreports of the car like taking exits and stuff when it wasn't told to and things like that. And I don't -- I\njust didn't know if there was much validity in any of that stuff. I mean, have you guys -- are any of these\nthings true? Because, I mean, you sound very confident about the technology, yet initially, there were\nsome reports of errors and things like that.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2015 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 03, 2015\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI don't think it should be a surprise that there are reports of errors. I mean, we described the Autopilot\nas a beta release, and one -- and that the system will learn over time and get better, and that's exactly\nwhat it's doing. So I think it's exactly what we described is occurring, and the system is getting better with\neach passing week. So I would expect that learning to accelerate, and for it -- I think it'll start to feel quite\nrefined within a few months."

        "paragraph9": "Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nI had a couple of questions. Just first on Model X, I just wanted to confirm, did you say you thought\nyou can get a few hundred produced and delivered by year-end? And just so that we understand what's\nbeen happening here, is it just the seat at this point? Or are there other unique challenges that you think\nprospectively affect the ramp of the vehicle?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nNo, to be precise, I said several hundred per week, that we expect to reach the production rate of several\nhundred per week next month. And it's difficult to predict the exact number that will be developed,\nbecause it -- because of what I was mentioning earlier of like we're on kind of an exponential ramp. So\nexactly -- one week this way or that can actually make a significant number -- significant impact in the\nabsolute number of vehicles delivered. But we do feel comfortable, at this point, of reaching the several\nhundred per week production rate before the end of the year, i.e., next month. And the issues are a bunch\nof little things. I mean, doors seals right now is a challenge, for example. The monopost seat in the second\nrow is still a challenge, but less of a challenge. It's not the gating factor. There's basically going through a\nseries of constraints, and those constraints can change from one day to the next. But the important point\nis that we see -- we don't see any fundamental obstacle to achieving a production rate of several hundred\nper week sometime next month.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nOkay. And it sounds like the target that you laid out, the 1,600 to 1,800 a week, it sounds like you might\nthink that, that's achievable in early 2016, and I wanted to confirm that. You didn't provide CapEx for next\nyear. But also, if you can just confirm, is that what you're sort of thinking you need to achieve that free\ncash flow breakeven?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. We -- I think it's likely that we can be in that 1,600 to 1,800 range -- per week range in Q1. I mean,\nI'm guessing, we'll probably be towards the lower end of that range, but then, maybe exceed that, the\nhigh end of that range, towards the end of next year, if things go well. I mean, there are some caveats\nthere like it depends on what macroeconomic conditions are like around the world next year. But right\nnow, we do see that 1,600 to 1,800 per week on average as occurring in Q1.\nRod Avraham Lache\nDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division\nGreat. And just lastly, if I can slip one last one in. You ramped up your CapEx, presumably in part to\nachieve some increased targets for Tesla Energy. Could you just give us some high-level thoughts on what\nyou might be able to ramp up to for that business line maybe in 2016?\nJeffrey B. StraubelTESLA, INC. FQ3 2015 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 03, 2015\nChief Technology Officer\nWell, the CapEx requirements for Tesla Energy are not that significant as a percentage of the total\n[indiscernible].\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. I mean, I think, just to sort of provide a broader perspective, the -- about the CapEx increase. So\nlet's talk 2016. The CapEx in 2016 is primarily going to be for Model 3 and the Gigafactory, as we are\nlooking at 2016 and beyond. It's not necessarily for much of the capacity required in '16. Clearly there is a\nlittle bit of CapEx there for Tesla Energy, but that's not the driving factor. Much of that CapEx has been put\nin place by end of this year for our needs next year."

Obviously, you guys are pulling the second-row seats in-house for the\nModel X, and there have certainly been some acquisitions and work you've done on forging and casting.\nI'm just curious, as you look at production going forward for the Model X, and even the Model 3, if there\nwould be opportunity to in-source more parts to really kind of solve the issues you're facing with some\nof these suppliers. And as you think about that, how you make that decision around cost and capital\nintensity?

And we're\nplanning to use that as a hub to recruit top tool and die manufacturers, so basically tool and die engineers,\nto Tesla Michigan, and with that exact goal, which is, how do we reduce our critical path to -- our time\nto market for new products? Because we end up being constrained by, basically, tools and molds. And\nanything we can do to tighten that time frame, organically-wise, an acquisition is a good thing. I mean,\nthe crazy thing is that, that $10 million or so that we spent acquiring Riviera was less than what we spent\non expediting our stamping dies. So it's like a no-brainer. And -- but we want to do that in general. We're\nlike looking at all of our critical path items and saying, okay, how do we execute faster on -- and reduce\nthe critical path for new product introductions, obviously with an eye towards Model 3 and making sure\nthat Model 3 happens as soon as humanly possible.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nBut is this significantly just around tool and die? Or are there other parts like, I mean, where you could\nactually be doing all the seating internally or start doing -- thinking about wiring harnesses or stuff that\nwould be that intensive and -- as far as in-sourcing?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWe actually are -- we have substantially in-sourced the seats at this point. So Tesla is producing its own\nseats, yes. So that's actually something we've already done.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionTESLA, INC. FQ3 2015 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 03, 2015\nOkay. And then, just a second question on the fourth quarter. You're talking about 17,000 to 19,000\nunits being delivered. I mean, is the -- just is sort of the low end and the high end of the range really\ndependent on the ramp on Model X, and you sort of see 17,000 at the low end as sort of your base with\nyour Model S? Just trying to understand that -- the range and sort of how we should think about mix in\nthe fourth quarter.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes. The big variables are what -- technically, in which week do we -- are we able to really spool up Model\nX production? And a few weeks movement, one way or the other, has quite a big impact on Model X\nproduction. And then, of course, we still have to get those cars delivered. So -- and at the end of the year,\nthere can often be logistical challenges because it's like Christmas and New Year's, and all the logistics\nchannels are jammed and people are not home. So and there can also be adverse weather events like\nblizzards and things. So that's what -- it's sort of logistical challenges at the end of the quarter and when\nexactly does the -- and what exactly does the Model X production ramp exponential look like, that's what\nintroduces the uncertainty.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nOkay. So we shouldn't think of the 17,000 as sort of a base level for Model S? There's a lot of variables\nthat are going in here in addition to the Model X ramp, right?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, end-of-quarter logistical challenges around Christmas sort of -- or is, for us, is a bit of a wild card.\nJohn Joseph Murphy\nBofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division\nGot you. Okay. And then just lastly, real quick, I mean, with everything that's going on with Dieselgate,\nobviously, your ZEV credits might be a lot more desired by a lot of folks out there. I know you guys are\ntalking about no ZEV credits in the fourth quarter as far as the sales -- or actually, at all for sales or gross\nprofit. But I mean, over time, I mean, is there an opportunity to maybe sell them at a much higher price if\nyou -- as they become available? I know it's not a big part of the business and -- but I mean, it does seem\nlike an opportunity to maybe, in the short run, to make a lot of money on some increasing demand.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nI mean, it really depends on what happens with zero emission vehicle regulations over time. You'd think,\ngiven Dieselgate and all that, that there should be a tightening up of zero emission requirements like --\nbut we're not seeing that yet. Frankly, the -- we do not think that the California Air Resources Board is\nbeing sufficiently stringent in this regard. I mean, if we can't sell ZEV credits, then it's obviously not -- the\nregulations are not strong enough."

So driving that's going out now are -- and for the last\nseveral months, have been excellent.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. We should probably note that, I mean, we've also made improvements to the large drive unit, and\nthose issues were really limited to early-population large drive units. So today, we hold the same standard\non both units that are being built.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nYes, exactly. There was like this one period of time where we had -- I mean, it was like there was --\ngetting into the weeds, like the -- we transitioned from a manual. Just before we transitioned to automatic\ngrease injection into the spline of the large drive unit, we had variation in how much grease was put into\nthis spline.

But clearly, the\nworld changed on you with currencies and so forth. So what's the right way to think about gross margin\nover the next 18 months?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, we -- our goal is to steadily improve gross margin, and hopefully exceed 30% on the S and X\nvehicles within 18 months, hopefully sooner than that. But it is -- it does require quite an intense effort\nto -- for every fraction of a point of gross margin. So -- and that assumes current -- there's not some\nradical shift in currencies that happens again. So the -- so yes, if according to our plans, at least, we\nwould exceed 30% gross margin within 18 months on the S and X line.\nAndrea Susan James\nDougherty & Company LLC, Research Division\nOkay, that would be without a meaning -- go ahead.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes, it's a combination of various initiatives of the company, from material cost reductions to\nmanufacturing production efficiencies and the labor-hours-per-unit reduction, combined with economies\nof scale that as our volume goes up, our cost allocation is more efficient, which brings our labor and\noverhead costs on a per-unit basis down.

        "paragraph13": "Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.\nEmmanuel Rosner\nCLSA Limited, Research Division\nI wanted to first ask, just put a finer point on the fourth quarter. So deliveries of 17,000 to 19,000 units\nseems like not a huge contribution from Model X within this. How do you ramp up the Model S deliveries\nsequentially so fast? I mean, it doesn't look like in the, I guess, in the Model S history, we've seen sort of\nlike such a sequential increase in deliveries like so. What are you doing, I guess, better in this particular\nquarter?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, it's not as big a leap as it might seem from Q4 to Q3 because there's a whole weak missing from\nQ3. And we continue to ramp the rate all the way from beginning of Q3 through end of year for Model S.\nSo it's actually not too much of a stretch, or less of a stretch than it may seem. And certainly, we've had\nmuch bigger sequential jumps before than this. It's worth noting that 2015 -- in 2010, Tesla was delivering\n500 cars per year. We now deliver 500 cars in just over 2 days.\nEmmanuel Rosner\nCLSA Limited, Research Division\nOkay, that's helpful. And then, just on -- again, a final point just on the Model X for this particular quarter.\nIt sounds like your -- have you actually started production? Sounds like you're still working out some\nissues there. And what has essentially surprised you as you sort of like ramped this up, which is causing\nmaybe the actual production in larger numbers to be maybe slightly later than it would have been?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectTESLA, INC. FQ3 2015 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 03, 2015\nWell, I mean, the thing about a car is because there's several thousand unique components in the car,\nthe production can only move as fast as the slowest component. So even though 99% of the Model X is\nready for high production, less than 1% of the parts are not, but those are what drive the rate. So that's\nthe thing that makes a car -- vehicle production really, really challenging and the vehicle ramp really\nchallenging. And you don't know in advance what those issues are going to be or you would do something\nabout it. So that's the -- yes. And then, you can basically think of it like the production will move as fast\nas the least lucky supplier that we have in our network, so yes. Most -- and there are sort of fires, floods,\nissues of various kinds around the world. And yes, so there's several thousand parts, and respectively, if\nyou go down to Tier 2 and Tier 3, several thousand suppliers, it moves as fast as the thousandth worst\nsupplier."

I'm curious\nwhat impact you see to the electric vehicle market from these revelations at VW. Could it increase the\ndemand for electric vehicles to your benefit? Does it maybe make nonelectric vehicles more expensive\nto produce to truly comply with the emission regulations? Does that help the Model 3 be more cost-\ncompetitive? I'm just curious what impact you see overall to the industry, and then to Tesla specifically.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nWell, I mean, the -- this has really shined a spotlight on the whole emissions testing process. And I mean,\nit's now obvious to consumers that gasoline and -- well, especially diesel, but also gasoline cars have real-\nworld emissions that are substantially greater than what's experienced in the tests, when they go through\ntesting. And I think that what one would naturally expect from this is that regulators will no longer turn\na blind eye to these things, and so the cost of producing gasoline and diesel cars that actually meet the\nlegal emissions requirements is going to be quite a bit higher. So I would expect the car companies to\naccelerate their plans for electric vehicles, which is great, and there might be some near-term benefit to\nTesla. But I mean, thus far, we haven't actually seen it, but there might be one.\nRyan J. Brinkman\nJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\nOkay, great. And then, just last question. I understand that deliveries for the Model X initially are clearly\na function of how many you can build, given your large backlog of orders.

And some of those cells would initially be allocated toward Tesla Energy products.\nAnd we still are targeting around 2017 for the first cell production that would be going into vehicles and\ninto the Model 3.

Or a change in ownership kind of dynamics at this point?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nWe are seeing a slight increase in the lease take rate in North America. And as we indicated in the letter,\nthat increase has been fully consumed or taken up by our bank leasing partners rather than Tesla direct\nleasing.

Elon, conversation is autos are a\nvery capital-intensive business. I mean, as much as you're pursuing a different model on the battery side,\nit looks like there's a lot of capital going into tooling and all these complicated mechanical things, not to\nmention service. As you kind of think forward 3 years, is that, more or less, the way you're going to spend\ncapital? Or is there anything you could do to kind of be more asset-light in the process?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nI mean, I think, stepping back, maybe the better way to look at it is that at Tesla our CapEx spend for\nwhat we are achieving, in my mind, has been really efficient in the industry.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect\nRight, and it's worth noting that Deepak spent a huge part of his career at Ford, so you have a good basis\nfor comparison.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nRight. And so -- and as we look at every year, and as we add incremental capacity and the CapEx related\nto that, we are continuing to increase on that efficiency in terms of CapEx dollars per unit of production.\nSo fully agree this is an asset-intensive business, and the key here, in terms of a dollar [ph] investment, is\nhow efficient we are with that capital, and that's what we are focused on.\nElon R.
