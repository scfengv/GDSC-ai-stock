"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We accept a trade-in only when that customer is buying a new Model S, if that's what you're trying to suggest. Deepak Ahuja: The early indications are quite positive, but obviously, for this 90-day period, there's going to be some overlap where we essentially incur dual expense."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We don't want to drive to a number that's greater than our ability to deliver high-quality vehicles. Deepak Ahuja: Most of the Autopilot deferral, we should be able to recover that later this year and maybe a small portion in 2016."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We're targeting release to early-access customers on August 15. And then depending upon how that is received and what issues we encounter in different parts of the world, we expect to go to wide release in 1 to 2 months after that. The Autopilot that -- or the orders there -- Highway autopilot essentially is using a combination of theforward camera, forward radar, the side ultrasonics and then the GPS navigation system."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: There is not publicly available data that is sufficiently accurate for Autopilot. Musk: We don't really have much choice but to create our own data set for driving. \"That's just the only way we can think of to do it good,\" Musk says."
"summary_text": "Deepak Ahuja: In 1Q, we will be free cash flow positive. Q4, it's hard to predict given that range. Elon Musk: It does not matter whether you have solar panels or wind. It seems sometimes like people like this too much to renewable energy."
"summary_text": "The 1,600 to 1,800 is down from what was being floated around as 2,000 for next year's production level. Is there something structural that's keeping you from hitting that on a run-rate basis, understanding that you can kind of surge to that at certain points? Or is there something that you've kind of been preparing for the launch, you've realized that you're just not going to have the capacity that you thought you would have?"
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: It's difficult for us to say exactly what the S, X demand ratio will be until the car is out there and people are experiencing it. But we have so many advanced orders on the X that that's something -- are not going to be an issue in the early days. We are going to try to get people their car as fast as we can."
"summary_text": "Tesla has 4 levels of a stack in terms of the utility utility Powerpack solution. The upper level is sort of the grids. Software to interface with the grid kind of tie in when it's needed. Second layer is the battery management software and then at the hardware, the inverter and other power electronics followed by the battery itself."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: We're speculating on what the actual entire market is going to do and how that's going to grow. Jeffrey B. Straubel: Grid parity is kind of the wrong concept here, but it's maybe a somewhat of an analogy to think about."
"summary_text": "Elon Musk: I do remain confident about 0.5 million cars in 2020 and maybe being able to exceed that. In the next few years, we expect to be focused on Fremont and the Gigafactory in Nevada. Long term, it's going to make sense for us to think about localizing production in different markets."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: Our biggest challenges are with the second row seat. It's an amazing seat, like a sculptural work of art, but a very tricky thing to get right. The pace of progress is really dependent on which supplier is the slowest and least lucky."
"summary_text": "Elon R. Musk: I think it's the first multiple choice I've gotten as a question. I would be super happy to see the whole industry go electric. And we have open-sourced our patent so those wouldn't be an impediment and but perhaps could be helpful."
