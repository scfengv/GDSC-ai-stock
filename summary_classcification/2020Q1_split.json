        "paragraph2": "Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2020 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ1 results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Paci\ufb01c Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent \ufb01lings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the \ufb01nal few weeks.This is the \ufb01rst time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak \ufb01rst quarter.Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatorycredits, while ramping 2 major products. What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviouslylearned a lot here. After all -- after the Model 3 ramp from 3 years ago, our new products get runfaster and become pro\ufb01table sooner. In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the \ufb01rst quarter thanModel 3s in Fremont in the \ufb01rst 2 quarters. Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster thanthe Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1. Most surprisingly is, otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule thatwe were ahead of already. Most surprisingly -- Model Y was pro\ufb01table already in its \ufb01rst quarter ofproduction, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traf\ufb01c lights and stop signs to earlyaccess users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week. Ourcars will now automatically stop at each stop sign or traf\ufb01c lights until the driver gets acon\ufb01rmation to proceed. I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but weare only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel that it is probably asafety improvement. We are collecting data from over 1 million intersections every month at thispoint. This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people startdriving again. Soon, we will be collecting data from over 1 billion intersections per month. All of those con\ufb01rmations are training on neural net. Essentially, the driver when driving and takingaction is effectively labeling the -- labeling reality as they drive, and it makes them really get betterand better. I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we're quite literally orders ofmagnitude more than everyone else combined. I think this is dif\ufb01cult to fully appreciate. It's thereason I'd say it's very dif\ufb01cult to have a search engine that competes with Google becauseeveryone is training Google all the time with their searches. So when you search something, andyou click on a link, you're training Google every time you do that. It's just very dif\ufb01cult for any newsearch engine to compete on that basis.So all those con\ufb01rmations are training on neural net, and soon cars will be able to drive through anintersection without a con\ufb01rmation as well as to make turns. And we really feel we're -- I feelextremely con\ufb01dent that it will be possible to do a drive from your home to your of\ufb01ce most of thetime with no interventions by the end of the year. So this is -- we can almost do this already with theleading-edge alpha builds driving in the car.So let's see, on other technology fronts, we increased the range of Model S and X yet again, thistime to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X. Actually, we said that, actually, themodel -- the real Model S range is 400 miles. But when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately, EPAhad left the car door opened and the keys in the car. So the car -- and they did this overnight. And sothe car actually went into waiting-for-driver mode and lost 2% of its range and, as a result, had a391 test. As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we're actually con\ufb01dentthat we will achieve a 400-mile or greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S forthe past 2 months -- the true range of the Model S for the past 2 months has been 400 miles. And ofcourse, we're not stopping there. We're looking -- we're going to continue pushing for improvedrange over time and improving handling, acceleration and all the little details that make Teslaspecial.For Model Y , we introduced a revolutionary 2-piece rear underbody casting, but we are going to bemaking a single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body iscast as a single piece, which is no casting of this size and complexity has ever been done before. Infact, there isn't even anything that is on par with the 2-piece casting for the Model Y . So we're reallypushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing. I'm very excited aboutthis approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH. It's better in everyway, essentially.We also -- for Model Y , we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car tohave a higher range. So the Model Y has remarkable range, on par with -- in fact, slightly betterthan, I guess, the Model 3, and despite being a bigger car that weighs more. And the heat pump is akey contributor to that. It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving. So -- and the feedbackwe're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive.We're con\ufb01dent this product will be our best-selling product ever.So in conclusion, and just looking -- I guess this is a forward-looking statement, we are absolutelycontinuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai,and here in Fremont when they will let us continue. Localized production in China and in Europewill bring the costs down, making our products even more competitive over time. While many othercompanies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite. We are absolutely pedal tothe metal on new products and expanding the company. And we're really looking forward to being,sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China andEurope and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year. So there's a tremendous amount to lookforward to, and we can't wait to tell you what's going to happen. Thank you."

        "paragraph3": "Thank you. And now to Zach's opening remarks.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thanks, Martin, and thanks, Elon. I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla teamthis past quarter. A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned. We successfullylaunched, ramped and demonstrated pro\ufb01tability of the Model Y , as Elon mentioned, signi\ufb01cantlyahead of schedule. This is our second large-scale product launch since Model 3 in 2017, and it'sevidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp ef\ufb01ciency. It's hard to understate thesigni\ufb01cance of demonstrating pro\ufb01tability of this program in its \ufb01rst quarter of production.Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents ofModel 3s built in Fremont. This is despite not yet running at full capacity while also managingthrough the production shutdown in early February. We also announced a long-range andperformance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China.On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of governmentincentives at the end of Q4. In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our \ufb01rst-ever Q1 pro\ufb01t. Automotive grossmargin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products despite chargestaken in Q1 associated with production downtime. We continue to make progress on OpExef\ufb01ciency as well as our service and other margins. Our energy business was impacted as well byshutdown activities in Q1, limiting deployments. We also experienced expected launchinef\ufb01ciencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted overallpro\ufb01tability.As I've noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which are credits we sell to other carmakers,to generally increase with time. This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4. And notethat most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it's re\ufb02ected in the accountsreceivable on the balance sheet.Our free cash \ufb02ows were impacted by the temporary increase in end-of-quarter inventory for all ourproducts resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations. Had theseinterruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong freecash \ufb02ows.As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-termplans and technology road map. We are taking the near-term actions required to continue thoseinvestments. Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned, and we're makingprogress on improving capacity for Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai. In the near term,our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash \ufb02ows andpro\ufb01tability to the company. In Fremont, we're working towards restarting production as soon asthat's possible.We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the \ufb01rst quarter.Our vehicle inventory balance increased by 14,000 units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind tofree cash \ufb02ows in Q1, but it's helpful in Q2. Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Yin Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locallyproducing and delivering vehicles.While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receivingmany online orders despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-term\ufb01nancial performance, and we will need to work through how quickly we'll be able to rampproduction to prior levels. More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash \ufb02ows aremanaged appropriately. Working capital management, in particular raw material inventory, is thesingle most important lever in managing our cash \ufb02ows during this time. The Tesla team has done agreat job here. We've also taken actions to eliminate or reduce noncritical expenses and optionalinvestments while continuing to drive ef\ufb01ciencies throughout the business.Overall, we've modeled many scenarios into 2021 and remain comfortable that we have suf\ufb01cientliquidity to proceed fully with our most important long-term investments. It's important to note thatTesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the substantial workwe've done over the last year to improve our cost ef\ufb01ciency and productivity. And we have theability to quickly adjust our spending and planning as required.So thank you again to the Tesla team for success in Q1, and we will turn to questions.Questions and Answers:"

        "paragraph4": "Thank you very much. So we'll take the \ufb01rst questions from institutional investors compiled by SayTechnologies. The \ufb01rst question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet topurchase or experience FSD despite most vehicles having all the necessary hardware. What leverscould you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage? For example, could youconsider offering FSD as a premium subscription?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards theend of this year. I should say it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as, in our view, buyingFSD is an investment in the future. And we are con\ufb01dent that it is an investment that will pay off tothe consumer and to the bene\ufb01t of the consumer. In my opinion, buying FSD option is somethingpeople will not regret doing.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOI agree. And \ufb01nancially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in thevehicle or a lease is -- will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preservethe option value of increased value of time. But we do understand that some customers who haveownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront. And so this will enablethose customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely. As you may be like, at a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area underthe curve of customer happiness. That is our goal. And we think that that's the kind of thing that allcompanies should try to do. And it's what results in long-term value creation. And loyalty begetsloyalty. So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we're con\ufb01dent thatif we behave like that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us."

        "paragraph5": "Thank you. The second question from investors is, China recently announced changes to its NEVsubsidy program that disquali\ufb01es Tesla vehicles from bene\ufb01ting from the subsidies. To what extentis there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer sothey can qualify for the subsidy?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production cost in China. And we're actuallyexcited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3basically tomorrow, China time. So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, Chinatime. And that will be a price below the subsidy limit. And we feel con\ufb01dent that, that will still be avehicle that delivers a good gross margin.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced inShanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's stillsigni\ufb01cant opportunity left to take cost out. So our \ufb01xed cost absorption from higher productionvolumes, which are occurring in Q2, will occur through the rest of the year. We're not fullylocalized on the supply chain yet. And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it's notcomplete, and there's additional opportunities there. And so we'll continue to bring the price downand expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this reduction in price that Elonmentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle."

        "paragraph6": "Thank you. The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved bycrises. In which way has Tesla improved or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-19?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more ef\ufb01cient as a company.That's -- one always has to do that in a crisis. And just thinking about our core beliefs and what dowe want to do, and we came to a conclusion that the right move is actually to continue to expandrapidly, continue to invest in the future and in new technologies, even though it is risky. And we'vetalked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well. So I think that there'sclearly an uncertain future ahead. It's a bit of a bumpy road. But I think the long-term prospects areextremely good. Anything you guys want to add?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, I agree with that, Elon. The prioritization on the key projects will enable us to execute moreef\ufb01ciently and faster on them, which I think is great. The other one that I would add is it's alwaysbeen our vision at Tesla to improve the customer experience and make that as digital as possible.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Touchless delivery.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSo touchless delivery, mobile service, touchless sales has been something that we've been veryfocused on and made a lot of progress on.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. The Tesla is the only car that you can literally order in less than 5 minutes on your phone, youcan order a car and have it delivered to your doorstep with all the paper and everything done. That'sit. Effortless.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOAnd many customers do that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorAnd they're doing it, yes. In fact, a big part of it is just trying to communicate to people that this issomething you can do because normally, buying a car is quite a pain. For most people, they wouldrather go to the dentist than buy a new car. Actually, my dentist is great. But it's really like quite anarduous thing. When the typical retail experience for buying a new car is more painful to peoplethan having a root canal done, you have to say, well -- and for Tesla, it is completely as easy asordering something from the Apple App Store or ordering something on Amazon, and except it's acar. Yes. All right. And 5 minutes is -- if you really went fast, I think you could order a car probablyin 90 seconds, so..."

        "paragraph7": "Thank you. The next question is from institutional investor is, can you give us a brief preview of theBattery Day by generally highlighting steps Tesla is taking to improve self-energy density and timeline for introduction?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Actually, we were just -- we don't want to preempt Battery Day. We want to -- leave theexciting news for that day, but there will be a lot of exciting news to tell. And I think it would beone of the most exciting days in Tesla's history. And we're just trying to \ufb01gure out the right timingfor that. We think probably the right timing will be the -- probably the third week of May. Notgiving a \ufb01rm date, but we think that probably that's the right timing. And depending upon whatwe're allowed to do, it will either be in California or Texas."

        "paragraph8": "Okay. And the last question from institutional investors, could you please update on progresstowards development and commercialization of Full Self-Driving? How much revenue have yourecognized so far?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSo there's a couple of things on the \ufb01nancials for Full Self-Driving. So currently, in North America,it's sold for $7,000 as an option. We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of itgoes into deferred revenue. That's associated with features that will be released with time. Ourdeferred revenue balance is continuing to grow. It's a little bit over $600 million. And so as werelease features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have beenreleased, the associated value, and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into our\ufb01nancials for that quarter. And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we canrecognize that revenue. So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenuewithin period. So I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful grossmargin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorAbsolutely. There's also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the \ufb02eet out there that couldupgrade to turn on Autopilot -- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving. And that's something that wewill enable just as simple in-app purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the end of theyear, as a subscription. So that's just a lot of untapped potential there. That's not in the deferredrevenue line, obviously, but is -- which is certainly a great deal of deferred potential that we think is-- a large portion of which is likely to reach fruition."

        "paragraph9": "Thank you. And now let's go to the questions from retail investors. Question number one, Elon hasmentioned a 50% compound annual growth target for Tesla in the past. Is this still in line withTesla's ambitions for the next 5 to 10 years? This would be 4 million vehicles in 2025 and morethan 20 million vehicles in 2030. Is 40% a more realistic target?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it's always dif\ufb01cult to predict what the macro situation is going to be. I think very few peoplewould have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with -- it sort of came outof nowhere. So I think in the absence of something -- some massive force majeure event, like quitemassive, I think [50%] is the likely number. It's possible that it's 40%. I would be very shocked ifit's less than 40% even with force majeure, short of World War III."

    {
        "paragraph10": "Okay. The next question from retail investors, when will you announce the next Giga? How manyGigas do you have planned for the next 5 years?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we will announce the next Giga possibly as soon as a month. We may not -- as soon as nextmonth. This is not a prediction, just saying. That's -- that could happen. It will certainly be within 3months and possibly 1 month. And that would be in the U.S. So as for how many will be in 5 years?I'm not -- I don't know right now what that number would be. I guess several more than there aretoday, but I'm not sure what exactly it would be in 5 years, but some number more than today.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOI'll also add that our Gigas have gotten bigger.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. It could arguably -- it could start being called Tera.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, with multiple products as well. And so the absolute number of Giga factories we mayultimately build might be less, but each one is larger. And that's under our belief that just signi\ufb01cantef\ufb01ciencies by having as much as possible and similar product lines under the same roof and asmuch vertical integration as possible all in one facility.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes."

        "paragraph11": "Thank you. The next question is, can you give us an update on Solar Roof ramp? How many areyou currently able to install per week? What is your installation per week target for the end of2021?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWe were actually gaining tremendous momentum with the Solar Roof before COVID, but COVIDessentially shut us down, both from the ability to install and the ability to get permits, like permitof\ufb01ces were closed. And with the shelter-in-place all over the places, so we obviously cannotinstall. And if you can't get permits, then you can't physically do it. It's physically impossible. So --but I think the long-term trend for Solar Roof is extremely good, and I'm con\ufb01dent that, let's say,within the next, I don't know, year -- maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of1,000 a week. That's not in the middle of winter or something. It's like taking seasonality --allowing for seasonality where it's hard to install on roofs that are covered in snow and ice, but likein, say, spring, I think installing, which is the hard part, we actually have demonstrated the ability tohit 1,000 a week gross build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already, so that's not a problem. It'sbuilding up the install teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roo\ufb01ng industryinstallers.And internally, we want to have at least 1,000 Solar Roof install teams with -- and taking a week orperhaps a little less than a week to do an install, which gets you 1,000 a week roof installations. Wesee demand is good. Production is good. So it's really all about the install. And then like I said alsobuilding out the -- training the very diverse group of companies in the roo\ufb01ng industry to alsoinstall Solar Roof that I think will scale -- allow us to scale far beyond 1,000 a week. We're alsoseeing a lot of interest outside of North America. So we do expect this to be a product that isinternational and actually seeing a tremendous amount of interest from China on the Solar Roof. Sowe're con\ufb01dent that this will be a very signi\ufb01cant product for the company over time."

        "paragraph12": "Thank you. The next question is, can you elaborate on Tesla's plan to enter the residential and/orcommercial HV AC market? Can you provide some basics of how your system will work? Will youconsider the heat pump water heater market as well?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, as I said on Twitter, I'm personally extremely excited to build a kick-ass HV AC system thatalso has sort of a hospital-grade particle \ufb01ltration, basically have a \ufb01ltration that \ufb01lters out viruses,bacteria, pollen, fungi and also neutralizes silicon and alkaline gases that is quiet and ef\ufb01cient. Andthese are all things we've achieved in our cars by the way. In fact, I don't know if a lot of peoplerealized, but the Model S and X are the only cars in the world that have a hospital operating roomgrade heavy \ufb01lters built in. They're very big. So you can get to a particle count that is insanely lowwith our cars.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOAnd 3 and Y have like MERV 16 or 15 capable \ufb01ltration.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. That's why Model 3 and Y are -- they're no slouches. Model 3 and Y are also way -- they'reway better than any other cars to the best of my knowledge. They're not quite as good as a hospitaloperating room, but they're extremely good, way better than any other normal car. And we'recontinuing to improve the \ufb01lters on 3 and Y . These actually have a big effect on health even innormal just day-to-day living. It's reducing particle count, and it has an effect on allergies and allsorts of things. So it's really -- air quality is incredibly important even in the non-COVID situations,extremely important. So taking all those things that we've learned and applying it to how mayHV AC would be and commercial HV AC would be just very exciting. And then if you've got -- ifyou're condensing water, like why not also have a few water source. If you have water, you possiblycould then heat the water and have a water heater as well.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Use it as a heat source if you need it instead of the outdoors, when the outdoors is really coldor the other way around. So lots of options.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorIt could be a hell of a product. So we just have to -- at Tesla, we have a tendency to apply a formula[we con\ufb01gure] on the product front. So we're going to make sure we have a lot of ice in the \ufb01re herefor new products with the Cybertruck, Semi, new Roadster and the Gigafactories in various parts ofthe world, and it's really Model Y , Autopilot and the Solar Roof and...Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFONew technologies.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. Powerwall, PowerPack, Megapack. We are seeing tremendous demand for stationarystorage, more than we can supply, at least for 2020."

And the last question from retail is, when will Tesla start acquiring utilities like theHornsdale Power Reserve and Moss Landing instead of selling them battery storage? Does it makesense for Tesla to buy bigger plants and convert them?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we haven't really thought about that yet. It's not out of the question, but our brand is full.Excuse me, sir, our brand is full. That's not out of the question. Our overarching goal is to helpaccelerate the advent of sustainable energy. And the 3 elements of that are sustainable powergeneration; then you've got to store the power, stationary storage; and then you've got to haveelectric transportation. So -- and we don't have like, say, speci\ufb01c market share goals or anything likethat. It's just, to the degree that we can accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, we think that's afundamental good for the world, and we want to do that as fast as possible.

And I think now we can move to analyst questions.OperatorOur \ufb01rst question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDI hope everyone's safe and healthy. I got one question, one follow-up. And I'd point out, I've had aroot canal before. And I would agree, Elon, it was less painful than buying a car.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThanks. I mean, really, it's -- yes, exactly.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDYes, it's a big problem, actually. It's a big problem.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorIt's crazy, yes.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDDifferent conversations. Zach, \ufb01rst, for you, any real-time update on company liquidity at the end ofApril? Some companies have, given the circumstances, gone out of their way to give a little coloron that. Just want to get your shot at that. Then I got a follow-up.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. It's a fair question. I don't have any additional color to provide. So $8.1 billion in cash and cashequivalents at the end of Q1, we're managing it very closely. As I mentioned in my openingremarks, we do have an increase in inventory of vehicles that we were unable to deliver at the endof Q1. So we're making progress delivering those through April, which is helpful for liquidity. Andas we've been looking at liquidity, we've been looking at this over the next 18 months. And there'sups and downs to the liquidity. Currently now, as we're not producing, we still have payables fromQ1 that we're paying off. But then in a couple of months, we'll quickly be through that, and thenwe'll have a gap in payables since we don't have any parts coming in. So it does go up and down alittle bit. But in looking at the long-term horizon, which is how we're managing it right now, we feelpretty comfortable with the liquidity position of the company.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I should say we are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area,and that should be identi\ufb01ed as a serious risk. We only have 2 car factories right now, 1 in Shanghaiand 1 in the Bay Area. And the Bay Area produces the vast majority of our cars, all of S and X andmost of the 3 and all of the Y . So the extension of the shelter-in-place or, frankly, I would call itforcibly imprisoning people in their homes against all their constitutional rights, that's my opinion,and breaking people's freedoms in ways that are horrible and wrong and not why people came toAmerica or built this country, what the (expletive), excuse me, the outrage -- it's just outrage.So -- but it will cause great harm, not just to Tesla but to many companies. And while Tesla willweather the storm, there are many small companies that will not. And all the people's -- everythingpeople have worked for their whole life is going to get -- is being destroyed in real time. And we'regoing to have many suppliers and are having many suppliers that are having super hard times,especially the small ones, and it's causing a lot of strife to a lot of people, yes.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDElon, on that point, you mentioned people that gave their lives to build the country, my thoughts foryou on this. There have been a lot of comparisons drawn to the state of the U.S. economy to theearly 1930s when Roosevelt began a series of new deals and infrastructure projects or post-WorldWar II when Eisenhower launched the U.S. Highway Act and JFK launched the Apollo Program,which you could say was in\ufb02uenced by the Cold War clearly, and you bene\ufb01ted from and our spaceprogram bene\ufb01ted from, what would be your message to U.S. lawmakers on this call as we -- inaddition to your opinions on shelter-in-place but thinking longer term, your message to U.S.lawmakers coming out of the crisis, speci\ufb01cally around EV infrastructure and a chance to kind ofwork with taxpayers to support sustainable transport and renewable energy? I'm wondering if yousee this as a chance to make the crisis and all the loss and lives lost not be in vain.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think it's high time we invested in infrastructure in this country. We have a lot of crumblinghighways and bridges. And frankly, when I visit China, I see their infrastructure as being muchbetter than ours. It's great. Europe has better infrastructure. It's really quite sad that the U.S.infrastructure, especially sort of roads and highways, is where it is today. And our airports, in a lotof cases, are an embarrassment. So -- and it's not just a question of money, it's a question of will.Sometimes, we spend a lot of money on these things, but what are we gaining for it? So -- and yes,we really need to be thinking about what is the transportation of the future, not the transportation ofthe past. If this was 1920, do you want to be investing in steam engines or internal combustionengines? Obviously, not steam engines. So this is the time to think about the future and also to askis it right to infringe upon people's rights as what is happening right now. I think the people aregoing to be very angry about this and are very angry. If somebody should be -- if somebody wantsto stay in their house, that's great. They should be allowed to stay in their house, and they shouldnot be compelled to leave. But to say that they cannot leave their house, and they will be arrested ifthey do, this is fascist. This is not democratic. This is not freedom. Give people back their goddamnfreedom.OperatorOur next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystA question on Model Y , I was hoping you can elaborate a little bit more on the drivers of how thegross margin is already positive at such low volume. How much of it is a function of thecommonality with the Model 3? What other factors should we think about? And what does thatmean for the ampler for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorZach?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. A couple of thoughts there for Y . The \ufb01rst is it does carry a higher ASP. So on the revenueside, it carries a higher ASP than Model 3. And the deliveries that we started with were of thehigher ASP versions of the cars. So we started with deliveries of performance initially. And so thathelps create some of the margin. And that will come down with time as more variants are released,and we have more of a steady-state mix. But it's similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model 3when we launched that product in Fremont 2 years ago.On the cost side, I think you hit on a couple of the buckets. The commonality is huge. It's veryimportant. And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to Model 3 as well.And so we have experience with that, both with Model 3 in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well. So theecosystem to support and launch the product is there. There remain a lot of opportunities to take --continue to take cost out of the car. And the number of vehicles that we built in the \ufb01rst quarter isquite limited relative to our goal.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, agree. We can take cost out of the car and to make the product better. So it's a test, it's not makethe product worse. It's -- and [anyone] can take costs out of a car, make it worse. We want to takecost out of the car, \ufb01gure out how to make it lighter and simpler. And so it's -- we want the car tojust incrementally improve as well as incrementally lowering cost. But for a 5-seater Model Y , weexpect marginal cost of that car to be comparable to the Model 3 once we have reached, say, about10,000 or 20,000 units or something like that and have -- did we go off-line?(technical dif\ufb01culty)OperatorSpeakers, you're back online."

        "paragraph15": "Sorry, we got disconnected for some reason. What was the question again? Okay. Let's go to thenext question, please.OperatorThe next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird.Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - SeniorResearch AnalystSo just wondering about the cell strategy. In Reno, you have, obviously, integrated there. But you'rebuying cells, I think, in Shanghai and then, well, we think in Germany. And so how are you lookingat that going forward? And then can you just talk about Mr. Mizuno and that Board addition andkind of the process with adding him to the Board?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. From a sales perspective, with all the partners we've had historically, in the future, we're justlooking for competitive technology and competitive pricing. I think we'll talk a little bit more aboutthis at Battery Investor Day, like, how we're approaching all of it. But -- so yes, I mean we don'thave like one model we're restricting ourselves to pursue. We're just trying to \ufb01nd what's best forthe products in the long run.And then the other question about the Board?"

    {
        "paragraph16": "Sorry, we couldn't hear the second part of the question.Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - SeniorResearch AnalystYes. I was asking about Mr. Mizuno entering the Board and kind of the process behind that andwhat he brings to the Board.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think, well, we all need a Hiro. And obviously, he brings tremendous amount of experienceinvesting at the highest levels in the world and has done great work as -- at the Japan pension fund,which is the largest, I think, fund of any kind in the world. And generally, the conversations overthe years is just churning incredible insight into how the securities -- the global security marketswork and what he thinks is -- whether [areas perform]. It just -- it seems like he has a strongphilosophical understanding about how to make the future better. And he shares our view regardingthe environment. And he's a very sensible, smart person who brings a lot to the Board and I think isgenerally recognized as such by many people.Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division - SeniorResearch AnalystI guess linking into the Panasonic relationship, maybe just how is that relationship going? And isthere any read-through on bringing him onto the Board?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorNo. I think this has got nothing to do with the Panasonic relationship. I mean I have a greatrelationship with the Panasonic CEO. We meet regularly one-on-one and talk all the time. And sothat relationship is strong. Just -- he brings more -- a broader, I think, global strategic view to theBoard.OperatorOur next question will come from Gene Munster with Loup Ventures.Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-Founder & Head ofResearchCongratulations on the progress. Elon, you talked about full autonomy by the end of the year. Iwould love for you to walk through the rollout strategy of the Tesla Network app and how that'sgoing to look prior to the robotaxi stage? Are you going to gradually take over human routes withautonomous capable routes over time? Or how do you see that playing out?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it's pretty much going to play out as it has played out, which is we'll release more and morefunctionality. Before we release any functionality, it goes through extensive testing. And of course,we run it -- we have a simulations team that has, I think, a very good simulation of the real world.So we run any car changes through a battery test and simulation. Then we have a global QA team,which I'm on actually, I'm one of -- on the global QA team. And we test the releases in the realworld, in the real-world map, [then if it \ufb01ts] in the real world and the simulation, which is -- whichare very many because the world is very complex anyway. And then we release it to a small groupof private beta testers within the company; then to a larger beta audience, including people outsidethe company; then to Early Access Tesla owners; and then, \ufb01nally, a broad release. And so there aremany stages that these things go through. So by the time something is being -- going to a widerelease into the U.S., it has gone through all of those stages. And the software that's at the very earlystage is much more advanced than what people are seeing.So it just got to go through a very rigorous safety process. So essentially, we need to \ufb01gure out --get very good at complex intersections, get very good at complex turns and intersections and thingslike busy malls, in a parking lot or of\ufb01ce park or special events and sporting events, that kind ofthing, when those eventually come back. Those are extra hard cases. But it's all tracking very well,if you like. The Autopilot's engineering team is -- we just have an extremely talented group, and I'mdeeply involved with the team. So we talk every week and meet every week when we can becausenow physical meeting is dif\ufb01cult. So I have quite a deep understanding where we are and wherewe're heading. And I feel like we have a tremendous amount of momentum, and we'll have thefunctionality, that's the Full Self-Driving, by the end of the year.Now after that functionality is released, there's still another step, which is to improve the reliabilityof it once it is released, kind of Full Self-Driving with the human -- supervised by the driver. Andthen we keep improving the reliability to a point where it no longer needs to be supervised by thedriver. And we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this is the case. And thenpresumably, the regulators, depending on which jurisdiction it is, would give approval for theautonomous cars that can drive with no humans onboard. Obviously, the regulatory approvalprocess, that's dif\ufb01cult for us to predict with accuracy because it's out of our hands. But for the restof it, I feel very good about where we are generally.Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-Founder & Head ofResearchSo to summarize, we want -- we're going to get owners full autonomy, some level of that by the endof the year and then a human in the loop, Tesla Network app sometime, is it \ufb01rst half of next year,would that be the hope?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorDo you mean like when can the car drive with no person?Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-Founder & Head ofResearchWith a person. Initially, a person who observes, would that be -- with the Tesla Network app, wouldthat be early part of the year of 2021? Is that the hope?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorIf described as a hope, I would say that that's probably a fair description.Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-Founder & Head ofResearchOkay. And then kind of take it to its end stage, the robotaxi stage, any high-level thoughts? Iunderstand the regulatory is a massive unknown, but if you're going to put a guess on it, wherewould we start -- when will we start seeing robotaxis?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I think it's quite likely, in my view -- again, I could be wrong, I'm -- as you see it, we're aheadin some areas, and we're behind in others because -- when I give a guess, I give the guess that Ithink is the likely midpoint, not the point with lots of margin. If it's a normal distribution, I'd giveyou the 50th percentile, not the 3 segment -- optimistic or pessimistic. So then that necessarilymeans at least half of my predictions will be wrong and half will be right. I think -- or it might beright but offset by a few weeks to a few months; in some cases, a few years. But I believe thateverything I've ever said would come true, did come true. It may come true late, but it did cometrue. So punctuality is not my strong suit, but I always come through in the end. So I think we couldsee robotaxis in operation with the network \ufb02eet next year, not in all markets but in some.OperatorOur last question will come from Pierre Ferragu with New Street.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOne on gross margin, \ufb01rst, and your impressive performance in Q1. So there are 3 moving parts: thetailwind from credits, of course; the Model Y ramping, even if it broke even, it probably tookaverage gross margin down; and of course, you had like Fremont being closed, shut down the lastweek of the quarter, it probably was the sort of an extra cost. And so when I looked at how grossmargin evolved sequentially, excluding these 3 moving parts, I felt like your auto gross margincould have been up like a couple of points sequentially. So I wanted to check with you if thatestimate would make sense. And then I will have a follow-up on energy storage.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSequential market improvement -- margin improvement?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. So the 3 things that you mentioned, I had a little bit of a hard time hearing the full questionhere because we're having a bit of network dif\ufb01culty in the room. I'll do my best here. So when welook at margin, we do exclude credit, as you have, so I agree with that. Model Y ramping, bringingdown overall gross margin, I agree with that as well. So it was lower than the overall average, andthat will increase with time. And shutdown and ef\ufb01ciencies in both Shanghai and in Fremont alsoweighed on margin, and the Shanghai margin was below the average as well. Even though it'sincreasing quickly and approaching Model 3, it still is below the average.And so I think the sentiment of your question was if you were to remove those factors, was there asequential increase in gross margin. I haven't speci\ufb01cally calculated that, but I think your intuition isright. We saw strength in gross margin across the board, as I mentioned. And in particular, S and Xgross margins continued to improve despite slightly lower volumes there and higher \ufb01xed costamortization.So there's good progress happening, both from the ASP side and the cost reduction side, for ourproducts and production. And I think this also lends itself to the power of the gross pro\ufb01tcontribution to the company once we get through these ramp inef\ufb01ciencies, we get Fremont up andrunning again, we increase capacity so we can spread out \ufb01xed costs and continue to execute oncost reductions on our products, we feel very optimistic about that path going forward.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureAnd I had a quick follow-up on energy storage, if you can hear me well. I think like -- I can'tremember -- I think from the very \ufb01rst days I heard you on the call, you've always mentioned thatdemand for energy storage is always outstripping supply, and you have more orders than you canmake. And so I'm kind of thinking there will be -- there should be an in\ufb02ection point in thatbusiness at some point, and it's going to be driven by your ability to add much more manufacturingcapacity like battery manufacturing capacity. And at a high level, how are you thinking about thatin\ufb02ection point in terms of time line?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOIn terms of time line, I think what we've been doing with both our partners and internally is lookingat how to reduce the -- fundamentally, the cost of investments in new cell capacity because whenyou look at a car -- a vehicle product, there's a lot of things in the vehicle besides the cells. Whenyou look at an energy storage product, it's really just the cells. And so to really grow the energystorage business, it's all about cell investments. And so that's what we've been focused on. And Ithink not to give too much away, but that will be one of the things we address in Battery InvestorDay, it's how we're focused on that. And when we have that in the place we want, it will be a loteasier to scale that business."
