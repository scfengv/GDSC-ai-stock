By the end of this year, we will -- we expect to be producingModel 3s in volume out of Gigafactory Shanghai.Here in Fremont, preparations for Model Y production have already begun. Since Model Y has high component overlap with Model 3, it should be a lot easier to ramp.

This is a totally mad thing to make as many cars in a year aswe've made in our entire history. But Tesla is expanding at an exponential rate.

And I think -- so like myguess is like long-term sales of 0.75 million units a year. And thenyou throw like a truck in there, pickup truck and till the semi, it just gets smaller and smaller.

In response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehiclebooked throughout the quarter. This will make the -- this will put much less strain on Tesla, resultsin a much better delivery experience for customers and have a very positive effect on our workingcapital. In Q1, Model 3 was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner-up byalmost 60%.

And there's also an increase in power. It accelerates faster. Just better, betterin every way.

"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectSure. The challenge really is battery cell scarcity. As far as the stationary storage is concerned, we webasically need an upsell to support the vehicle production as well as to both Powerwall andPowerpack. This year, we think that we'll be able to allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of cell outputs.Jeffrey B. Straubel - Tesla,. Inc - CTOBetween 5% and 10%, exactly that.

So there are far fewer cells in a Powerwall than in a car, so that translates to quite a decentnumber of Powerwalls. We alsohave -- we're also planning a significant increase in retrofit solar this year because we've finallyrefined the product offering to be something that's extremely compelling and much more costefficient to deliver and install. And then the Solar Roof tile, we're onversion 3 of the design. That necessarily takes a while to scale up because we have to be confidentthe Solar Roof is going to last for on the order of 30 years and because the warranty is sort of20, 25 years.",positive,0.562570333,Energy Generation and Storage

But in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling and equipment required for Model Y . So we don't expect this to, in any way, delay production of ModelY , but it's currently a very close call between Nevada and California as to whether we do the ModelY at Giga or at Fremont.

Is anticipated demand for Fremont-built vehicles less than was previouslythought? Or have you managed to maybe find more capacity in Fremont with the tentor some other production method?

So we can essentially have a substantial price sort ofarbitrage -- or information arbitrage opportunity where we have direct knowledge of the risk profileof customers and basically the car. And then if they want to buy Tesla insurance, they'd have toagree to not drive the car in a crazy way. Or they can, but then their insurance rates are higher.

Musk: Being public does feel like the sort of price of the stock is being set in kind of a manicdepressive way. But I'm not sure what to do about it. It's still the same house. So it's a little bit of adistraction at times, but I am not sure how to get around it.

One is, as we increase volume back on our S andXproduction line, there's just a natural benefit there from the fixed cost absorption which will help us.

This improvement is reflected on the configurator asof today. And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it's really just incredible specs all around. I think we will make as -- about as many as we can sell for many years. It's going to be pretty nuts. So -- and I think, actually, the productis better than people realize even.

And we are working also not just through Tesla SolarRoof but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whetherit's in North America, on the order of 4 million new roofs per year. So we see a lot of interest. And so it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do theinstallation.

And then on the insurance part of the question, it is our intent to allow people to put their cars intoride-sharing or the FSD network using Tesla Insurance. That's not currently the case, but by thetime that this is available, it's ourintent to get that ready. And last part of question was, will there be a discount for using Autopilot with our cars?

What's the target for Tesla Insurance in 2020?""",neutral,0.607608229,Charging Infrastructure

And we're really onlybeginning to take full advantage of the Autop Pilot hardware, the FSD hardware. So I think it's -- theapparent progress, as seen by consumers, will seem to be extremely rapid. But actually, what'sreally going on, it seems like that is just having the foundational software be very strong, havereally strong foundation. And then a really fundamental thing is moving to video training. This is a really -- I mean, in terms of labelingefficiency, arguably like a 3 order of magnitude improvement in labeling efficiency. So that's really great progress on that. And the last retail investor question comes from Kendall.

And just having a factory in China or a factory. in California or afactory in North America and a. factory in Europe, just that alone, is a massive improvement in ourfundamental operating efficiency.

"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely.

But I think we're at a point now where OpEx will start to tick up, at least if you lookannually from 2019 to 2020, to support our international footprint and then the growth of thecompany. Our job is to grow that significantly slower than the pace of growth of revenue to improvethe operating leverage, which we're very, very focused on. And the last question from investors is, ""the sales of model S and X have stayed flat forseveral quarters. The main reason is that they still use 18650 batteries. When will S andX use 2170batteries?

We -- except to say that like as I said earlier, we're spending money as fast aswe can spend money in sensible ways. So it's definitely not artificially limited, and we will spend --well, a lot of money is here, for sure. The challenge comes in like finding efficient ways to actuallydeploy the capital. That's the harder part than sort of deciding on a CapEx number really. And I think we always find ways to become more CapEx efficient per unit of capacity.

So we've got to really make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery productionand continue to improve the cost per kilowatt hour of the batteries. This is very fundamental andextremely difficult. So I said we're going to do like kind of Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this and whatour plans are.

We're worried about production, make sure we get that production ramp going and reach volumeproduction as soon as possible with Model Y. And it's hard to -- it's always hard to predict what that S -- the exponential part of the S-curve ofproduction.

And our next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni, could you tell us what exactly is in that, call it, roughly $3.5 billion. Areyou going to get to full like 10,000 car per week capacity? Is that in the $3,5 billion? What will Gigafactoryproduction be? And in the slightly more than $2.4 billion, is that also including the investments, Elon, that",neutral,0.575726986,Automotive
"Q1 volumes are much higher than what youwould have anticipated originally for Q4 when you thought that margins would be breakeven. But for next quarter, you're suggesting thatthey're going to be negative again. So can youhelp reconcile the apparent enthusiasm you have about the gross margin trajectory with the fact that yourguidance around gross margins in the near term actually appears more cautious than it was guided at thetime?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerCan you hear us?A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionYes, I can hear you. Yes, to sort of finish off your first part of the question, no, we will still have furtherinvestments in the 10,000 per week capacity of the Model 3 happening next year as all of that will beconcluded next year. So that'll continue in '18 -- in '19.",neutral,0.600599229,Automotive
"The most fundamental difference is thinking about the factory as -- really as a product, as a quitevertically integrated product. There aren't fundamental new technologies. There's still -- it's not really -- the amount of technology that changes, not thatmuch. It's treating it as more of an engineering and a technical problem as well instead of just a...Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionRight, which is the Toyota production system.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes -- we don't think so.Jeffrey B.

"Elon Musk: There's really -- there are only 2 things that I'm aware of that are constraints in production ofany significance. The module is the most significant; and then the parts conveyance, basically, theautomated conveyance system that brings parts to the lines. And I think we can get 10,000 vehicles a week out of Fremont without a significant -- withoutcreating really any new buildings of significance in the existing space. We will need to bring up the southpaint shop, which is what we actually were using for S and X paint, and so we upgraded north paint todo S, X and 3. But with relatively small CapEx, way less than we spent on north paint, we're comfortablewe can bring south paint up to achieve the approximately 600,000 vehicle per year rate to combined100,000 S andX, 500,000 3, which would be 20% to 30% more than Toyota and GM produced.",neutral,0.632685572,Automotive
"I can see a path where we get to, say, 600,000 Model 3 production and100,000 S and X, so maybe 700k. We should be like almost 50% more than GM and Toyota get out of the plant. I think that seems achievable. These things get increasinglydifficult, but they're all doable.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionCan I just sneak one in for Deepak? You did a great job of working capital in the quarter. Howrepeatable do you think the benefit from working capital is going forward? I mean, is this really just thebenefit of negative working capital and as you ramp up, you'll get this cash inflow? And then also as welook at the customer deposits and the ZEV credits, those were 2, I think, apparently large cash inflows. Imean, how",positive,0.632164747,Automotive
"Elon R. Musk: I think probably the biggest item is as we get the software right, people upgrading to full self-drivingcapability of S and X. And anything with Hardware 2, which is like the 8 cameras, more advanced opsights and improved compute capability, I think, will be capable of the fullSelf-driving. And that -- some of the sort of semiautomated driving definitely doesn't require anyhardware upgrades than that $5,000, that's essentially a software product with 0 cost -- 0 marginal costand so it's 100% margin.Deepak AhujaChief Financial Officer: We can probably -- that's more thana $3,000 increment.",positive,0.557159513,Full Self-Driving
