        "paragraph": "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Tesla Q3 2018 Financial Results and Q&A Webcast. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director ofInvestor Relations. Mr. Viecha, you may begin.Martin ViechaSenior Director for Investor RelationsThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2018 Q&A Webcast.I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and a number of other executives. Our Q3results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter we published at the same linkas this webcast.During our call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differmaterially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filingswith the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectThanks, Martin. So I'll make some opening remarks, and then we're going to talk about vehicle safety,Autopilot and factory safety. And we have a number of people from Tesla here to elaborate on that. So Ithink there's just a lot going on that you would find interesting.But I want to start by thanking all of our customers, employees and shareholders. This was an incrediblyhistoric quarter for Tesla. Model 3 production stabilized. We delivered a total of 84,000 vehicles globally,which is more than 80% of vehicles that we delivered in all of 2017. In fact, we delivered more cars in thisquarter than we did in all of 2016 in a single quarter.Model 3 became the best-selling car in the U.S. in terms of revenue and the third best-selling car in termsof volume. We saw higher revenues and significantly better profitability in our energy business. I mean, Ithink with solar, it may have been the best quarter ever for solar. We achieved GAAP net income of over$300 million, increased cash and equivalents by $731 million and achieved a greater than 20% grossmargin for Model 3.And moreover, we expect to again have positive net income and cash flow in Q4. And I believe ouraspiration is something that will be for all quarters going forward."

    {
        "paragraph": "I think we can actually be positive cashflow and profitable for all quarters going forward, leaving aside the quarters where we may need to doa significant repayment but -- for example, in Q1 next year. But I think even in Q1, I think we can beapproximately flat in cash flow by end of quarter.This quarter was made possible by the incredible execution of our employees across the board, from sales,production, delivery, service, energy, engineering, finance and all of our G&A teams. Really every partof the business executed incredibly well. I want to thank everyone again for their incredibly hard work.I especially want to thank customers who helped -- it's like I've never even heard of this -- maybe thishas happened before, but I've never heard of a case where a company's customers actually cared aboutthe future of the company so much that they volunteered their time to help the company succeed. I thinkthat's amazing. Just -- you don't see that anywhere. So yes, really, chokes me up, actually. 5This quarter, we started rolling out Version 9 of our software, which is the biggest software upgrade in 3years. And Model 3 received a 5-star safety rating in every category and subcategory. I think that's thelowest probability of injury of any car that the U.S. government's ever tested.Looking ahead, we expect to produce and sell even more Model 3s in Q4 and expect that trend to continueinto Q1. And we're excited to bring Model 3 to Europe and China early next year given that the market formidsized premium sedans in those regions is even larger than in North America.I said before that we must prove that Tesla can be sustainably profitable. This quarter was an importantstep towards that, and I'm incredibly excited about what lies ahead. So this is -- yes, just so, so proud ofthe Tesla team and our customers. Really appreciate the support of our long-term shareholders. And yes,I just want to say on behalf of the Tesla team, we're just super appreciative of your support through whathas actually been a very difficult time.All right. Now let's move to -- let's start off with vehicle safety. Madan, who's our lead vehicle safetyengineer, been with the company for a long time. Madan, how many years has it been that we've beenworking together?Madan Gopal10 years.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectEight?Madan Gopal10 years.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect10 years."

        "paragraph": "Wow, so yes, I've been working with Madan for 10 years. And we've had so many conversationson vehicle safety. Wow. And you know what, the -- we're really going to try to go the extra mile withvehicle safety, not just -- in fact, there's a series of government-mandated tests, but what somecompanies do is they game the system. So they know where the side pole impact is going to be. Theystrengthen it right in that position. At Tesla, we're like, \"Okay, what is the weakest point in the car? Let ustest it at that position.\" So the actual safety is not fully captured in the tests because we anti-game thesystem. Madan, if you...Madan GopalThank you, Elon. Just to give you a very quick background about myself. So like I said, joined Tesla 10years. I'm extremely very happy to mention I'm working with an extraordinary set of very passionate andvery hard-working individuals, and that essentially shows in our product. So that's very important for us.And also important is our principal mission statement on safety because what we want to do is safety hasbeen -- is probably the important factor for our vehicle. It's not just for electrical vehicle. Any vehicle,period. And that fundamentally differentiates us, so -- which essentially helps us to keep adding newfeatures and new safety technology. And that's very important and that shows in Model 3. Just the thingsthat we have.Also the fact that we have electric vehicle, the design and architecture uses a fundamental benefit overtraditional vehicles. And that takes care of, for example, whether you have a block of engine in the frontwhere we can work with using pretty much open architecture in the front. And the whole fact that youhave all the electrical and high voltage and motors and all of that almost below the central gravity of thevehicle, it's the lowest probability of reduced or lower risk, and that significantly benefits.Elon R. Musk 6Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. I think architecturally, we have Newton on our side. And having Isaac Newton on your side isdefinitely the way to go.Madan GopalRight, exactly. So in the latest series of tests, I would like to specifically talk about Model 3. NHTSA did aseries of tests, actually 4 tests, for 1 frontal, 2 side and 1 rollover test. And if you look at -- we've beencalculating how can we distinguish within the 5 star."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "There are so many vehicles that already get 5 star.And if you look at within the 5 star...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectThat is not all the same. Not all the same.Madan GopalYes, exactly. So if you look at there, the tricks we came up with, which is a part of U.S. NCAP rating itself,as a lowest probability of injury, Model 3 has the lowest. And just to give you a context, there are a totalof 900-plus vehicles since 2011 which have been rated. So the fact that Model 3 is the best among all the943 to be exact. So that speaks to value.And I'm very happy to say that Model 3 has achieved -- we are not stopping right now. What we wouldlike to do next is how we can make use of the active safety and Autopilot features and make it even moreimprovement so the next area that we're focusing on, how to integrate active and passive safety. That'sour next area of challenge, which we will improve for sure.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. And so worth noting that the safety extends to not just people in car but also pedestrians.Madan GopalCorrect.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. So not having a big engine block in the front of the car is really helpful so -- because if you -- if thecar were to hit a pedestrian, we'll get to active safety next because the best thing is actually not just to hitcar or a pedestrian. The fact that the hood can condense so far in is really helpful because it ends up beinglike a sort of -- sort of like a trampoline or like -- it has -- you just -- you don't have a rock underneaththis. That's very helpful.So it's helpful for pedestrian safety and for the safety of people in the car. And then even if you have like ahead-on collision with another car, the extended sort of crumple zone of a Tesla Model S, X or 3 is helpfulto the people in the Tesla and the people in the other car. So it's not just for people in the car.Madan GopalI'd like to add one item, which is essentially how we look at the real-world safety, which has always beenan important element for Elon."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "So if you look at the -- our blog post, we showed how we handled thecentral fall impact in the front hood. By the way, that's not part of NCAP rating. Just to show how we goover and above the NCAP rating to make sure it's real world safety. That's very important for us.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect 7Exactly. That's what I mean by like anti-game the system, like what is the worst way that the car could behit, not just sort of strength and where we know the test will happen and that kind of thing. So obviously,we're all in these cars, our friends are in these cars, family is in the car, so we care a great deal aboutsafety. A lot of people think safety is boring, but not Tesla. So thanks, Madan.Madan GopalThank you.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectThank you for your decade of hard work and the rest of Tesla safety team. And with that, let's move on toAutopilot and yes, just give an update on sort of Autopilot software, AI and hardware. Yes.Stuart BowersVice President of EngineeringThat's great. This is Stuart Bowers. We will soon begin to roll out the team's most advanced Autopilotfeature ever, Navigate on Autopilot. In our last release, we launched a new set of neural networks thatcombined together, provide a view of everything happening around the car.With Navigate on Autopilot, we'll use information to understand exactly where the car is on the highwaysystem and to automatically change lanes, handle forks and take high-curvature exits to follow a navroute. Initially, it will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn signal before the car movesinto an adjacent lane. Future versions will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement if theychoose to.One area that I'm personally really excited to build on with this improvement is active safety. With theadvancement in neural networks covering 360 degrees of view around our car, we can provide a level ofconstant vigilance that humans just can't. Ultimately, this should allow us to warn, even intervene, for anenormous percentage of modern accidents and to ship these improvements as software upgrades to ourexisting customers.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectAnd we have a lot of -- we see this all the time in the data where the car will do an automatic brakingevent and save a pedestrian or another car from impact."

        "paragraph": "This happens all the time.Stuart BowersVice President of EngineeringAll the time.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. All the time. Essentially every day. So great [ preview ].Stuart BowersVice President of EngineeringYes. The team's done incredible work here. And by bringing more of the cameras around the car, we candetect things as they come toward us, not just directly in front of us.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes.Peter Bannon 8Director of Silicon EngineeringHi, this is Pete Bannon. The Hardware 3 design is continuing to move along. Over the last quarter, we'vecompleted qualification of the silicon, qualification of the board. We started the manufacturing line andqualification of the manufacturing line. We've been validating the provisioning close in the factory. We'vebuilt test versions of Model S, X and 3 in the factory to validate all the fit and finish all the parts and allthe provisioning close. So we still have a lot of work to do, and the team's doing a great job. And we'restill on track to have it ready to go by the end of Q1.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectGreat. And that will be roughly 1,000% increase in thrust and capability compared to the currenthardware. And so it's obviously a giant improvement. Despite being about the -- it costs about the same,cost volume, and product consumption are approximately the same as the current hardware. But it's atenfold improvements in frames per second. Yes. And improved redundancy as well.But very importantly, very important to emphasize is that the only -- the thing that needs to changebetween the cars produced today and the cars that are produced in the second quarter of next yearis swapping out the Autopilot computer. And this is a simple change that takes place in half an hour inservice to upgrade the computer. And anyone will be able to upgrade their computer to full Self-Drivingcapability -- upgrade their car to full Self-Driving capability with a simple service visit.So we expect all cars with the Hardware 2 sensor suite, basically anything made in the last roughly 2years will be upgradable to full Self-Driving.Peter BannonDirector of Silicon EngineeringYes. In fact, a lot of the cars we're using for testing today have, in fact, been upgraded from Hardware 2.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectRight."
    },
    {
        "paragraph": "So it's very important to emphasize like people shouldn't -- it's like -- it seems like people want towait until that comes out, but there's no need to wait until that comes out because it's just a very simpleplug-and-play change to get the full Self-Driving. And anyone who's paid for the full Self-Driving optionwill just get it done for free. And anyone who still wants to order full Self-Driving at this point, it's just anoff-menu item. You can still order it, but we took it off the order -- menu just because there are -- it wasreally creating a lot of friction in the sales process and people didn't understand the difference betweenEnhanced Autopilot and full Self-Driving.So just to simplify the order process, we took that off. But anyone who asks for it can certainly get it.And it really ends up being a discount on future capability. But to be clear, there's definitely no need towait until Q2 to order a car. It's -- we want to make it just a completely seamless process. So there's noadvantage to ordering now versus Q2. Andrej, do you want to...Andrej KarpathyDirector of Artificial Intelligence & Autopilot VisionYes. Thanks. Hi, everyone. I'm Andrej Karpathy, I'm the Director of AI here at Tesla. And my team trainsall the neural networks that analyze the images streaming in from the all the cameras for the Autopilot.For example, these neural networks identify cars, lane lines, traffic signs and so on.The team is incredibly excited about the upcoming upgrade for the Autopilot computer, which Petebriefly talked about. This upgrade allows us to not just run the current neural networks faster. But moreimportantly, it will allow us to deploy much larger, computationally more expensive networks to the fleet.The reason this is important is that it is a common finding in the industry, and that we see this as well, isthat as you make networks bigger by adding more neurons, the accuracy of all their predictions increases 9with the added capacity. So in other words, we are currently at a place where we've trained large neuralnetworks that work very well but we are not able to deploy them to the fleet due to computationalconstraints.So all of this will change with the next iteration of the hardware, and it's a massive step improvement inthe compute capability. And the team is incredibly excited to get these networks out there.Elon R."

        "paragraph": "MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectGreat. Thank you. And I've said this before, but I think -- let's talk about how we look at the longer-termfuture. We absolutely see the future as kind of -- as sort of shared electric autonomy so that you'll be ableto do ride-hailing or share your car in any way in a sort of long-term model that's some combination oflike Uber, Lyft and Airbnb. So there'll be Tesla-dedicated cars for ride-hailing, and there'll be -- and anycustomer will be able to share their car at will, just like you share your house in Airbnb.So it's a combination of those 2 models. I think it's pretty obvious where things are headed long term. Theadvantage that Tesla will have is that we will have millions of cars in the field with full autonomy capability,and no one else will have that. So I think that puts us -- that will end up putting us in the strongestcompetitive position long term.And then, Laurie, can you finish off with -- let's talk about factory safety. And thanks for the hard work ofyou and your team. And I think we've made great strides. And yes, please, please go ahead.Laurie ShelbyVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)Yes, thanks. We have the safest cars made by the safest people. So it's an exciting time here at Tesla.All car and manufacturing factories have injuries. At Tesla, we have a commitment to 0 injuries. And ourtarget is actually on good reporting. So we have good reporting of injuries, good reporting of near misses,good observations and lots of improvements. So to be the safest company in the world, we have to becommitted to that. And everybody here is. So we're actually steadily getting there, and we're not going tostop until we're there.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectAbsolutely.Laurie ShelbyVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)So one...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. So I've been mentioning like -- for example, like we had like some sort of -- for example, like we doget these like quite unfair accusations. For example, one of them was like we were underreporting injuries.And it's worth noting that OSHA completed their investigation and concluded that we have not been doinganything of the sort.Laurie ShelbyVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)Correct. Correct. The company here had a 4-month long Cal/OSHA investigation."

        "paragraph": "And it basically provesthat we are recording properly and doing as we should be. So it's much different than what you wouldread about in the press.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect 10Yes, that is true.Laurie ShelbyVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)Yes, yes. I'm very proud of the team for that. It's a -- yes, one point I think people don't know is I've beenhere about a year now. Time flies when you're having so much fun.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectFeels like 5 years.Laurie ShelbyVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)I know. But when I joined, we were already really a fraction -- our injury rate was a fraction of what it hadbeen when Toyota and GM ran the factory in the Numi days. So what we're all about is really continuing tomake improvements from there.And what's also important is not to have serious injuries. And that's extremely rare here at Tesla. We havereally strong focus on prevention and also using mitigating controls so that these types of injuries don'toccur. I mean, most of the injuries that we have are muscular sprains and things like that.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. Essentially, it's muscle strain and getting scratched.Laurie ShelbyVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)Exactly.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectThat's the most of the injuries here.Laurie ShelbyVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)Yes, hand and finger cuts and sprains. So I kind of just want to break down a few things that my team hasbeen working on, along with all the leaders here.First is people and engagement. So one of the first things is meeting with you, Elon. We meet with you ona regular basis. We meet with all the production leaders. So it's full on engagement on improving safety.We have built a really strong EHS team, the best and the brightest.We have -- and our EHS team is actually embedded into the line on the factory because we learn theprocess and we learn the people. You don't know how to improve unless you're out there, on the line, onthe process, engaging with the associates, listening and learning from our associates. So we have reallystrong engagement, health and safety committees. We do find it, fix it walks. Our walker -- our leadersare out there walking and also looking for improvements.And actually, just this quarter, we had over 15,000 improvements. I mean, that's like amazing."

    {
        "paragraph": "So very,very excited about that.We also look at risk reduction and -- in human performance. People are going to make mistakes, so we'regoing to design in so we fail safely. We have an early symptom intervention program. This is where wehave industrial athletes go out on the line and work with our associates before anything happens. Like ifyou have a pain, let's work it out. Let's strengthen and really get our employees fit. So we're doing that. 11We've also just opened a new and improved health clinic. So when injuries do occur, we get the absolutebest care for our associates. And it's actually overseen by one of California's leading orthopedic surgeons.And we did that because most of our injuries, like we said, like 80%, 85%, are those sprains and strains.So now they get that best care here on site. And we have 24/7 care. It's actually staffed by 3 full-timedoctors and nurses. And I'm really super happy with the care they're giving, and I think employees are aswell. And the third...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. We're going to expand on that. So the -- yes, Tesla's sort of health clinic both at Fremont and at Giga,so that we have a really immediate, first-class health care available right on the spot when people need it.And this is not just for workplace. This is for workplace and non-workplace.Laurie ShelbyVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)I know. That's super exciting. We're leading the world.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. If you like have injury for any reason, then there's health care immediately on site.Laurie ShelbyVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)That's where we plan to go, exactly. And then finally, just being proactive because that's what we'reabout, innovation and proactive. I mean, we joined a national safety organization. We partner with manyleading universities, including California Berkeley, Center for Occupational and Environmental Health. Wedo presentations there. We work with the automotive industry and do benchmarking all the time. We'realways looking and bringing people in to look for things that we can do better and for new technology oninnovation and safety.And with all of that, we have made improvements in our injury rates. We are more than 10% better year-over-year in our lost workdays and our days away. But the most important thing is we're also getting allthose good engagement observations. They're moving up. So injuries down. Observations, engagementsup. Thank you.Elon R."

    {
        "paragraph": "Our first question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research.Daniel V. GalvesWolfe Research, LLCIt's really amazing to see this landmark quarter after covering the company for so long. And thanks forbringing some of your team on to the call. It's very interesting. My first question is about cell supply.There's been some noise about tight cell supply and sparks and tight labor supply. Like in the short term,could you just talk about whether demand is outpacing supply of battery cells? And kind of what's yourplan for long-term expansion, including cell supply in China?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectJ.B., do you want to take that?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerSure. I can speak to that. This is J.B. We have had a period where the supply was fairly tight for Model 3.But it did not really constrain the Model 3 production in any significant way.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, like for a week.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. Maybe for a few days. Yes, the impact was larger felt on the energy products. And that's stillsomewhat tight. But we do -- as we pointed on previous discussions, we do have third-party suppliesof energy cells. So that production can continue even independently of the Panasonic supply in sparks.So that's been very helpful. And that is expanding in future quarters. And also the Panasonic supply isexpanding. The productivity of existing lines is continuing to improve with a lot of hard work from theengineering teams and just operational stability. And we continue to bring online new production lines. Soeven just in the last several weeks, we started out by getting another self-production line with Panasonic.And through the end of the year, there's another line coming on and then one shortly after that. So there'sa steady increase in the total supply that should keep us ahead of even Model 3 growth and also should letus have a larger percentage of energy supply be sourced from Giga locally.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. We are making a pretty nutty amount of the world's lithium-ion batteries. And Martin, like, I thinkwe're at 60% or something.Martin ViechaSenior Director for Investor RelationsYes. So at the moment, if you look at -- for example, for Q3, all electric vehicles made around the world,their total battery capacity was about 20 or 19 gigawatt hours."
    },

        "paragraph": "And what we produced in Q3 was aboutthe same or a little bit higher.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect 13Okay.Martin ViechaSenior Director for Investor RelationsSo about half of the world's batteries, basically.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. Well, that's -- because we also source cells from Japan and elsewhere. Was that -- are you talkingabout just Giga or...Martin ViechaSenior Director for Investor RelationsSo -- yes. So just the Giga itself is about 20. And on top of that, S and Xs, I don't know, another 4 or 5.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes.Daniel V. GalvesWolfe Research, LLCGot it. No, it's a huge advantage. Is there plans that you can talk about for cell supply in China? Will thatbe produced in China? I'm assuming so.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectLong term, it would be produced in China. Short term, we're not certain of the short-term situation. Butlong term, certainly."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.Pierre C. FerraguNew Street Research LLPI was very surprised in the numbers you reported today, your gross margin performance on the Model 3.So if I remember correctly, you were expecting more of a 15% type of margin for this quarter, and youactually did better than 20%. So can you take us through what improved, like faster and better than youhad initially anticipated in the manufacturing line and where these improvements came from?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerDeepak here. And Jerome and others, please feel free to join. Our improvements on the cost side werein every aspect of cost. So clearly, our manufacturing labor hours improved significantly. Our overallmanufacturing cost dropped almost 30% sequentially, Q2 to Q3. We produced more volume. So we hadbetter fixed cost absorption. We had far less scrap. Our yield on each of the lines across both factoriesimproved significantly. And as we look forward, we see even more opportunities. We are going throughthis phase where we are now stabilizing production and the team can now intensely focus on costoptimization. And that trend will just continue in Q4. Yes.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectI think we're also being roughly on the conservative side when we predicted it. We said like 15% but we'rebeing conservative... 14Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerRight. Our expectation was we would do better but we wanted to be conservative, you're right, in terms ofour guidance that we gave for Q3. Yes.Pierre C. FerraguNew Street Research LLPOkay. That's great. And then on -- as a quick follow-up, you've announced over the weekend like a mid-range car with smaller battery packs. And I was wondering, as you're looking at expanding, for example,the Model 3, I think about it as you had 2 options. One was to go -- grow and to keep what you're seeingat higher-end, higher-ASP car. And the other one was to go for a lower-cost car and stick to the U.S. Sohow did you decide the sequencing of these 2 things? Why is it lower car now and going abroad in theearly next year?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, we're trying to provide the most affordable electric car options that we can. And since we just don'thave the money to get to a $35,000 car right away, we thought this might be a way to offer it as anintermediate step. And that's really it."

        "paragraph": "Yes, we expect to start producing a significant volume for Europein January. And it obviously takes some time to ship. So deliveries, probably pretty significant deliveriesin Europe, kind of in the late February, March time frame because the cars have to get all the way fromCalifornia to a customer in Europe. And for us, cars only count as delivered if it reaches the end customerand all the paperwork is completed correctly. So it's the highest possible standard for considering a sale asale. Yes.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd also to APAC, we start delivering cars.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. The -- we may or may not deliver cars in APAC in Q1 but certainly in Q2. It will be kind of borderlineas to whether cars are delivered in APAC by the end of Q1. So I can't say it for certain. Definitely inEurope. But -- and then definitely in APAC in Q2. Yes."

It's probably in the order of -- anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million cars a year,let's say, good global demand for Model 3. I think it's something like, say, the 3 Series, that's around 0.5million.Deepak AhujaChief Financial Officer0.5 million.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectThe BMW 3 Series is about 0.5 million a year globally. And generally, we find that we outcompete the BMW3 Series quite well. So it seems like logical therefore that we will long term have a higher production --or higher demand, maybe somewhere between kind of the BMW 3 Series and the Volkswagen Golf, whichis about 1 million units a year. So yes, that's why I said anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million units a year,long term.Romit Jitendra ShahNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research DivisionAnd you have to add new lines to support that? Or are you just going to continue to remove bottlenecks inthe existing lines?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectNo. We're definitely going to do local production. In China, we're moving rapidly on that. So we're aimingto have Model 3 production for the China market, for the Greater China market, active certainly next year.It will be happening next year. But it will be done in a very capital-efficient manner, much more akin to theway we did General Assembly line 4 versus General Assembly line 3."

Is the target still to produce 10,000 Model 3s a week in3 months? And I think you mentioned in the past that once you got to run rate of around 5,000, you'd be 16better placed to assess what CapEx is required to get there. So as of today, do you have a better idea ofwhat CapEx is required to get to that kind of level at 3 months?Elon R.

So likeI'd probably see a path to like 7,000 units with Model 3 with really minimal CapEx.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerVery minimal.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. Very minimal to get to 7,000 a week. And then that's really just basically solving -- improving theuptime of the existing lines. And we can do the 7,000 a week. Yes, so -- and then it gets a little harderas you start to go above 7,000. We would need to at least bring lines down in Fremont for significantupgrades to get to 10k. But also just not -- we're not talking about massive amount of CapEx. Butlet's say like long term, it's -- again long term, it's -- predicting these on a quarter-by-quarter basis isvery difficult because when you have an exponential growth rate like we do -- I mean, if look at Tesla'scumulative deliveries over time, it's like the cleanest exponential curve that I've ever seen. So -- but smallmovements in calendar time can look like a very large hit or miss one way or the other because it's sucha steep curve. That's why I'm -- it's very tricky to predict things on a quarterly basis but a lot easier if yougo out a year or so. Yes, I mean, it -- probably long term, it's at least sort of 7,000 to 10,000 cars fromFremont of Model 3 and then, I don't know, 5,000 to 8,000 in the rest of world, something like that.

Is that -- should we be thinking more about like a revenue-sharing model sort of like how Apple takes a piece of revenue generated for applications from iPhones?Elon R.

And so if there's a way we can think of where third parties coulddo something, then that could make sense. But I do know for sure that Tesla will operate its own ride-hailing right -- its own ride-hailing service. We'll compete directly with Uber and Lyft, obviously, but thenalso have the ability for customers to offer their car and add or subtract their car to the fleet at will. Itwill be a company-owned fleet. And the company-owned fleet will just be where there aren't enoughcustomer cars to be lent out. So if we find like in a particular metro, there aren't enough customers whoare willing to add their car to the shared fleet, then that's where we'll supplement it with a Tesla-ownedfleet. So that's why it's a sort of combination of the Uber/Lyft thing and Airbnb.

If I can just squeeze in since I couldn't ask the first one that you could answer,do you think that the third quarter is a milestone, Elon, where you think Tesla becomes sustainably self-funding and perhaps not in need of outside capital?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, that is our goal. We do not intend to raise equity or debt. At least that's our intention right now. Thatmay change in the future. But the current operating plan is to pay off our debts and not to refinance thembut to pay them off and reduce the debt load and overall leverage of the company. So -- and actually, Ialmost forgot one quite important thing. As -- and this is quite helpful. It's helpful to have these sort ofcrisis situations with logistics, for example. As I dug into the inventory -- like basically finished productinventory from factory to the customer, I was quite surprised to see how long that took and that it wasquite expensive in a lot of cases to get cars to customers. This was something I didn't fully appreciatebefore. And we really have a major initiative at Tesla to get the average time from a car exiting the factoryto receiving the check from the customer, being in the customer's hands, we have to be clear, we can onlyget the check when we give the car to the customer. So getting the car from the factory to a customer,to get that to be as short as possible. In August, the average time in North America to get a car fromthe factory to the customer was 30 days, which is embarrassingly long. By the end of the quarter, we'vereduced it to around 20 days. And our goal in Q4 -- this is a goal, not a promise. But our goal is to getthe average time of a car from the factory to a customer under 10 days. This is a giant improvement inthe capital efficiency of the company because we're making on the order of $75 million worth of productsper day -- of cars per day. So every day, it requires $75,000 -- $75 million worth of capital. So every 10days, it's $750 million."

Butthe banks will only loan us 85% of the cost of the vehicle, which translates to about 70% of the priceof the vehicle. So -- and then we've got this loan outstanding, which effectively increases the COGS ofthe car. And it dilutes the company to the tune of 30% of one of the inventory -- of the finished goodsin transit is. So this is really like tightening that and getting that below 10 days in North America andthen also improving dramatically the time -- the transit time to Europe and Asia. It is where like havinglocal factories is actually very important for the capital efficiency of the overall system because I thinkover time, we want to get the time for a car going from a factory to a customer under 7 days worldwide.And then the terms that we have from our suppliers are, on average, just over 60 days. Now our partsinventory management, also there's a lot of room for improvement there. We think we can probably cutthat down to a few hundred million dollars or so, Deepak, something like that, maybe $200 million or$300 million of parts at the factory. So effectively, what we're going to do is reverse the working capitalrequirement for the company quite dramatically to the point where the faster we grow, the more capitalwe have. This is incredibly important for the capital efficiency of the company. It's night and day. Deepak,is there anything you'd like to...Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerNo, I think you are totally -- we are reducing the raw material inventory on one hand by keepingproduction stable, finding efficiencies in warehouse management and supply chain and at the same time,reducing the time to deliver the car and convert that car into cash.

Deepak, the OpEx expense management was verystrong in the quarter. I think it was down 13% sequentially, and OpEx was only up 5% year-over-yeardespite revenue growing 71%. So on that front, I mean, in hindsight, did you get too bloated and neededto get more rightsized? And looking forward, how do we think about OpEx growth versus revenue growthon kind of a more normalized basis?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. Tony, so excluding onetime items, our OpEx decreased sequentially by 5%, to just clarify that firstof all. And a lot of that was driven by the actions we took in Q2 to be more efficient with our employeeheadcount. We benefited from that in Q3. And we were really careful in terms of all of our spending. Theother piece that helped us is a lot of our Model 3 spending on expense, sort of, R&D is reducing becauseModel 3 is going into production. So Q2 to Q3, we saw a reduction there. And it just gives you the senseof the leverage of -- the operating expenses can have while our revenue was growing dramatically. So ourOpEx will increase in the future but in a far slower rate, and we will continue to be really, really carefulabout the spending. And I think there are actually more efficiencies than we can find.Elon R.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. Just essentially, the cash flow for everybody increases quite dramatically. Dilution or leverage outsideof the ABL line improves dramatically.
