Our Q1 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time inthe update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events and resultscould differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in ourmost recent ﬁlings with the SEC.(Operator Instructions)Before we jump into Q&A, Zach will have some opening remarks. Zach?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. Just to start off here, Q1 was a challenging but extremely successful quarterfor the company. Despite numerous supply interruptions, including shutdowns at our Shanghaifactory and nearby suppliers due to COVID, we've continued making progress and achieved ourbest-ever vehicle deliveries.Last quarter, we demonstrated a series of new ﬁnancial records, including revenue, gross margins,operating margin and bottom line proﬁtability. GAAP automotive gross margin reached 32.9% and,for the ﬁrst time, exceeded 30% when excluding regulatory credits. Higher pricing continues topositively impact our ﬁnancials as we make progress delivering cars in our growing backlog. Notethat, for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long. Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generallycarried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being ordered today.Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well. Inﬂation, raw material prices, expedites and logisticscosts continue to impact our cost structure. Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efﬁcient manner.Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more proﬁtable vehicles, including the Model Y . Wealso recognized a onetime beneﬁt of $288 million from credit revenue relating to a regulatorychange in the U.S. CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined comparedto the same period last year.The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions more severely than thevehicle business. Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes haveimpacted supply of certain components for our solar systems, which is reﬂected in our solar volumefor the quarter.OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and other items. As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, weachieved a record operating margin of over 19%.",

Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding productﬁnancing, to nearly 0.Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2. First, we've lost about amonth of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns. Productionis resuming at limited levels, and we're working to get back to full production as quickly aspossible. This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2. Second, as I've mentioned before,Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramp, and thus, those inefﬁciencies will start to ﬂowthrough our gross margins in Q2. Third, we do have higher ASPs in our backlog which will help tooffset some of these headwinds.We continue to drive towards further strengthening of our ﬁnancials in the second half of the yearand believe our 50%-or-above growth rate remains achievable for the year.I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team, our suppliers and our new customers for a great ﬁrstquarter.",

Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach's, but it's maybe worth repeating. Q1 wasonce again a record quarter on many levels by reaching the highest deliveries, proﬁt and anoperating margin of 19%. This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and anoverall difﬁcult quarter. So I'd really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving recordproﬁtability and output despite many, many difﬁcult headwinds. And especially the Tesla Chinateam in our Shanghai factory, they really had signiﬁcant challenges due to the COVID shutdownsand nonetheless have been able to output a tremendous number of high-quality vehicles, and we arealready back up and running with the Shanghai factory.So as Zach said, we remain conﬁdent of a 50% growth in vehicle production in 2022 versus '21. Ithink we actually have a reasonable shot at a 60% increase over last year. So let's see. Obviously,we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months,so with 2 fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly. Now with newfactories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially. So I have very highconﬁdence in the teams in both factories, and we expect to ramp those initially slowly but, like Isaid, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.So we're also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is adedicated robotaxi. That's highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steeringwheel or pedals. And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quiteexciting. That is fundamentally optimized for -- it's trying to achieve the lowest fully consideredcost per mile or cost per kilometer, accounting everything. And so it's, I think, going to be a verypowerful product. We aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024. So I think that really willbe a massive driver of Tesla's growth. And we remain on track to reach volume production of theCybertruck next year.So basically, once again, I'd like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I'd liketo thank our suppliers who have really gone the extra mile. We have an amazing supplier group, andI want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure thatTesla is able to keep the factories running.And we're really at the early stages of that journey.",

But is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their ownconclusions on progress being made, interventions per mile driven or any other data?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSure. Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I've ever been involvedin, I've never really seen more kind of false dawns, or where it seems like we're going to breakthrough but we don't, as I've seen in full self-driving. And ultimately, what it comes down to is thatto solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world artiﬁcial intelligence, which nobodyhas solved. The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes. And so actually,when you think about it, in order to solve full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and camerasto a degree of some capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.And I think we will achieve that this year. The best way to reach your own assessment is to join theTesla full self-driving beta program where we have over 100,000 people right now enrolled in thatprogram, and we expect to broaden that signiﬁcantly this year. So that's my recommendation, jointhat full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take note of the rate ofimprovement with every release. And we put out a new release roughly every 2 weeks. And you'llsee a little bit of 2 steps forward, 1 step back. But overall, the rate of improvement is incrediblyquick. So that's my recommendation for reaching your own assessment, literally try it.",

        "original_text": "Thank you. The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown inShanghai have in Q2? What is the time line for localizing the Model 3 in Europe? Or will newermodels be prioritized in Berlin?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, we did lose a lot of important days of production. And because there are sort of upstreamsupplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also lost many days of production. But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance. So I think notwithstanding new issues that arise,I think we will see a record output per week from Giga Shanghai this quarter, albeit we are missinga couple of weeks. So that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1,maybe slightly lower, but it's also possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher.But it's really, call it, roughly on par. Then Q3 and Q4 will be substantially higher. So it seemslikely that we'll be able to produce over 1.5 million cars this year. That's my best guess.And then Model 3. It's important for new factories to be focused and have the least amount ofcomplexity and variation, which is why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y .From the point in which you have a factory complete and you're making a small number of units tothe point where it's producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of 9 to 12 months from start ofproduction. So now hopefully, we're getting better at that ramp, so maybe it's a little less. But to getto sort of the 5,000-a-week level has typically taken us around 12 months from start of production,yes.",

The next question is, how much raw material exposure do you have, measured roughlyin percentage of cost of goods sold, for example, in a given quarter versus 1 to 2 years out, bothdirect and indirect? Separately, how do you think about price increases versus prioritizing highermix vehicles going forward?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorActually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we're beingunreasonable about increasing the prices of our vehicles given that we had record proﬁtability thisquarter, but the wait list for our vehicles is quite long. And some of the vehicles that people willorder, the wait list extends into next year. So our prices of vehicles ordered now are reallyanticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that we're aware of and believe will happen over thenext 6 to 12 months.

Just to add to what Elon is saying, there's different ways to calculate raw material exposure. Ithink the simple way -- we estimate around 10% to 15% of our cost structure exposed to rawmaterials. And just to clarify a couple of things on that. So we've been experiencing increases incost in general, but also raw materials, for a number of quarters now. That pace picked up in Q1, solast quarter. And what we're seeing for Q2 is slightly higher than that as well.And as indices move, it doesn't impact us immediately or directly. In some cases, we have contractswith suppliers. But then, as those contracts expire, we have to renegotiate them so that there can bea lag. In some cases, our contracts do directly reﬂect movement in commodity prices or rawmaterial prices. But the timing in which that Tesla pays for that has a lag associated with it as wellbased on the contract.And so to Elon's point, what we're trying to do here, because it's quite an unprecedented situation ofraw material movement in all of these various lags and uncertainty around renegotiating contracts,is we're trying to anticipate where things will go and make sure that the pricing that we have put inplace at the time that those raw material cost increases hit us is that they align and that the companycan remain ﬁnancially healthy in various scenarios as we look out over the next 4 quarters.",

Separately, why isn't Tesla using 800-voltarchitecture in its vehicles? What are the advantages or disadvantages?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSo from Tesla's standpoint, obviously, we'd love to have federal legislation that allows direct salesin all states, but we have not seen willingness on the part of the Congress to enact such law thatwould override a variety of state laws. So unfortunately, we have to ﬁght it on a state-by-state basis.And Drew, do you want to answer the 800-volt question?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, sure. On the 800-volt thing, yes, so it's really a case-by-case thing. For the smaller platformvehicles like 3 and Y , there's some wins and losses with 800 volts, not everything is better. And sowe look at that platform and we're not like ignoring the reality that you can go to a higher voltage,but there's nothing really encouraging us to do so on that platform. It's really about mass and power.And as you look at bigger vehicles, there are some advantages on those bigger vehicles.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorLet me just quantify that. Basically, our estimate is that going from 400 to 800 volts might save$100. It's not really moving the needle.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd you're changing many things from charging infrastructure all the way through the entirevehicle system to get maybe $100.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Exactly. So I mean, in the U.S., you've got 110-volt household power voltage and then mostpossible like sort of 220. But really, it doesn't make that much of a difference. And appliances workpretty much as well in, say, Europe as they do in the U.S. The advantages are small and the cost ishigh. Say, like long term, like years now, does it make sense probably to an 800-volt architecture?Probably. But it really needs a very big vehicle volume to pay for all the cost of changing from 400to 800 volts. And then Drew, do want to continue with it?Andrew D.

We're working in all the areas we shared on Battery Day, and we have sort of consistentprogress across all of those areas towards achieving the 5-year cost trajectory goals for the costwithin our control, but we do not control all the commodity costs. So that's an exception I needed tocall out. Similar to Model 3, it will take us several years to get rate and yields to the point whereeverything that we've discussed is achieved. Our priority was on simplicity at scale during ourinitial 4680 structural battery ramps. And as we attain our manufacturing goals, we will layer innew material technologies we are developing and higher-range structural pack provisions.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think maybe in a nutshell, I think it probably is fair to say that 4680 and structural pack will becompetitive with the best alternatives later this year and we think will exceed the best alternativesnext year.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. I mean we have some good existing proofs, right? Like we've built the facility here in Texas,like we know how much we spent on capital equipment in the facility. And it's more than 5x lessthan prior technology installations. So we're saving huge on CapEx, on utilities and personnel. Weknow what those loads are and how many people are needed to run what is basically a highlyautomized factory.

        "original_text": "Thank you. And the next question is, how does Tesla plan to secure raw materials required to scaleto extreme size?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. So this is something we think about quite a lot. It depends what extreme size means. Butcertainly looking at, like, say, the $5 million, $10 million, $20 million -- 5 million, 10 million, 20million vehicle levels, you really have to analyze sort of macroeconomic, just like what is thetonnage of lithium that you need, of nickel, of iron phosphate, of graphite separators, electrolytes. Itlooks like -- really think of like just macro tonnage.And we need to think about this for the world as a whole because just -- we want to what -- there'slimiting factors for accelerating the advent of a sustainable energy future. And whatever the mostlimiting factors are, Tesla will take action on those limiting factors. So right now, we think miningand reﬁning lithium appears to be a limiting factor, and it certainly is responsible for quite a bit ofcost growth in the cells. It's, I think, the single biggest cost growth item right now absolutely on apercentage basis. Although just for those who don't totally know this, the actual content of lithiumin lithium ion cell is maybe around 2% or 3% of the cell.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy Engineering5 kgs a car.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, 5 kilograms exactly. It's called lithium ion cell, but by far, like the most expensive and heaviestitem in the cell is the cathode. So that's the nickel or the iron phosphate. So we're looking carefullyat all of the raw materials and trying to ﬁgure out how we can accelerate the total amount of rawmaterials needed to transition the world to sustainability. I think we've got -- we don't have enoughtime on this call to really go through all those details, but we are thinking about these things. Andwe think we'll have some exciting announcements in the months to come.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes.

We regrind any plastic out. And so we're really concerned about raw materials, not just likemining them and consuming them, but when we get them in the door, using all 100% of them.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, Lars, that's a great point. So we're storing -- we're installing sort of melt furnaces for probablyminimum.

But aswe build newer factories or vehicles, for example, Giga Texas here, where we are today, we[shifted] all this non-yielded or scrap aluminum from the stamping shop directly into the castingshop. We regrind any plastic out. And so we're really concerned about raw materials, not just likemining them and consuming them, but when we get them in the door, using all 100% of them.

The ﬁrst question comes from Dan Levyfrom CSFB.Dan Meir Levy - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystFirst, maybe you can just talk through or address what some of the drivers of cost improvementwere in the quarter. Was it just further improvements within Shanghai or in Fremont? Anythingaround sort of ongoing kaizen that you've talked about in the past, maybe you could just talkthrough what you beneﬁted from in the ﬁrst quarter.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOSure. I mean at a high level, cars produced in Shanghai do carry a lower cost structure than carsproduced in Fremont. And so as our mix of cars shift towards Shanghai, the average cost ispositively impacted by that. We're also seeing some progress in manufacturing efﬁciencies inFremont, particularly on the S and X side, as volume increases improves there. Expedites has beena huge story for the company. Q4, we had massive amounts of expedites. Q1 was still quite large,but we did make progress on bringing that down some.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, Drew mentioned like -- kudos to the Fremont manufacturing team and our associates therebecause we're achieving record output at Fremont.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes, the Fremont team is doing a tremendous job.Andrew D.

Like you should -- the expedite situation with the crazy logistics thatoccurred with COVID.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. And to Elon's point, the Fremont team and also the Shanghai team, has been extremelydynamic with the unpredictable nature of our part arrivals. And our supply chain team, in particular,production planning portion of supply chain, we often get very little notice when part shortage iscoming, and it's kind of a scramble couple of days before that part is supposed to arrive to ﬁgure outhow to get it here.

And that inﬂation appears to be likely to continue for atleast the remainder of this year is what -- when we're talking to suppliers, suppliers are under severecost pressure, so yes. And in some cases, we're seeing suppliers request 20% to 30% cost increasesfor parts from last year to the end of this year. So there's a lot of cost pressure there.That's why we raised our prices because we -- when things [lose sense] with respect to inﬂation,you know it's high, and we've got orders that go out a year or more, in some cases, then we have toanticipate those cost increases.

It soundslike you're optimistic about Tesla's ability to solve this for Tesla. But do you see this as a constrainton EV adoption more broadly?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Absolutely. What's sort of keeping our costs down, at least in the short term, is that we havelong-term contracts with suppliers. But those long-term contracts will obviously run out and thenwe'll start to see potentially signiﬁcant cost increases. But the macro -- sort of looking at the worldas a whole and saying, \"Okay, what does it take for us to transition to sustainable energy faster?\" It'sfundamentally -- the fundamental limiting factor is the output of cell -- basically, cell output. Atwhat rate can lithium ion cells increase the gigawatt hours per year, that is the fundamental limitingfactor. So in order -- and that will move as fast as the slowest, least likely element of the wholesupply chain.Currently, we see that as being a challenge with lithium. To be clear, it's not that there's a shortageof lithium ore in the world. Lithium is present almost everywhere. It's a very common element.However, you still need to take up the ore, take up basically the sludge or the clay with the lithium,and then you need to go through a whole series of reﬁnement steps. And that's a lot of industrialequipment that's needed to reﬁne lithium ore to lithium that can be used as lithium hydroxide orlithium carbonate in a battery cell.So we think we're going to need to help the industry on this front. I mean the industry is growingfast and I certainly encourage entrepreneurs out there who are looking for opportunities to get intothe lithium business. Lithium margins right now are practically software margins. I mean Zach,correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we're seeing cases where the spot lithium price is 10x higherthan the cost of extraction. So not like we're talking [19%] margins here. Can more people pleaseget into the lithium business? Do you like minting money?

My second question is, it'simpressive to see just a modest increase in cost per vehicle, cost of goods sold per vehicle, givenwhat we've seen in terms of commodities actually. And from here, you have a lot of savingsopportunities with 4680 cells and the cell manufacturing changes, the anode chemistry structuralpacks, giga castings. Are you suggesting that even those may not be sufﬁcient to offset the inﬂationthat you're seeing and that you're going to need additional pricing as well in addition to thosespeciﬁc initiatives that you've called out?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe hope we don't need to increase the pricing further. The current pricing is anticipating what wethink is the probable growth in costs. And if that growth in cost does not materialize, we actuallymay slightly reduce prices. So we don't currently anticipate making signiﬁcant price increases. Butobviously, we don't control the macroeconomic environment. If governments keep printing vastamounts of money and if there are not signiﬁcant increases in lithium extraction and reﬁnement andother raw materials such that everyone is competing for a limited amount of raw materials then,obviously, that will drive prices to high levels. So if you have a crystal ball that can tell us what thefuture is going to be like, we'll adjust accordingly.

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringBut I think if you zoom out, right, like as you said, our mission is to accelerate the transition tosustainable energy. So we are working with our existing suppliers and others to ﬁgure out how togrow all of these raw materials as quickly as possible to not slow down the transition. And whetherthat means we have to get directly involved in some cases or not comes down to the counterpartyand their willingness to expand at the rate we think they should be able to expand. And that'ssimilar to what we've done with everything else. Like we built a Gigafactory in Reno because itneeded to be done.

        "original_text": "Yes.Colin M. Langan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity AnalystPerfect. Just to follow up, sorry to keep going on the raw material issue on the battery side, butobviously, it seems pretty important. How quickly can raw material supply be built? Because myunderstanding is it takes many years to build that out. So are we just sort of phasing? When do youthink we see a lithium shortage or a nickel shortage? And is there even enough time to build thatsort of mining capacity in place? And then related, how quickly can you switch to like LFP for thenickel issue?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. I mean I'll take the LFP question. Like it says so in our letter, like half of our products wereLFP last quarter, which shows how quickly we were able to respond to -- well, honestly, it wasn'tbecause of a raw material shortage but just because it seemed like the right thing to do, we couldchange our cathode chemistry. And there's more to be done on the cathode side, and we are activelypursuing it to give us substitution ﬂexibility in response to market conditions between the othercathodes that are out there that can be competitive in our vehicles for which there are many options.I guess what I would say is, speciﬁcally on the cathode side, like ﬂexibility is the way we're goingto achieve this. And not all of the materials that go into cathodes are actually, ﬁrst of all, hard tosecure like through mining or reﬁning; and second of all, in many cases, are like very plentifulalready, like huge scale. And if all of the batteries in the world use those cathodes, it's less than a1% increase in total annual output. So that's the cathode side.I think Elon already spent a lot of time talking about lithium. It really depends on the resource.Some resources like just getting rocks out of the ground. Expanding the amount of rock that you'regetting out of the ground is maybe a little bit of paperwork and some additional sort of blasting andtrucking operations. The reﬁning is maybe where it's a little bit more chunky to bring it online. Butalso the reﬁning doesn't -- it's not like an oil reﬁnery. It's a much, much smaller operation to reﬁnelithium out of spodumene or liquid like a brine or a salt pond evaporation. So you're talking about atime scale of 1 to 2 years.",

        "original_text": "Fantastic. So let's go to the last question from Mark Delaney from GoldmanSachs.Mark Trevor Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity AnalystYes. I was hoping you could comment on your latest thoughts about potentially opening up thecharging network in the U.S. to non-Tesla owners. It's certainly really important to have a goodexperience for Tesla owners in terms of wait times and charge installs. But if Tesla is able to haveenough capacity, it could be a really good way to bring other vehicle owners into the Tesla network,perhaps help Tesla to sustain its network beneﬁts and maybe make more people likely to buy Teslavehicles in the future.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. As Elon has said and as we've publicly committed, yes, we do plan to provide third-partyvehicle access in all over the world, not just in Europe where our original pilot was. And we areworking on solutions in North America, which is a little bit more problematic with our connectorbeing different than others, but we are moving in that direction. I don't know if you want to add.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Yes, I think there's more to be said on that for growth, yes. We want to do the right thing withrespect to the whole system.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOAnd we're going faster on adding chargers. With the growth of the cars that we're producing andthen anticipating what Drew was discussing, overall charger capacity is really important. And so thepace of our investment in supercharging has accelerated.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorAbsolutely.Mark Trevor Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity AnalystOkay. That's helpful. And for my second question, could you share any more details on TeslaInsurance? In particular, as you wind it out in more states, are there any metrics you can share onwhat take rates have been like? And how do proﬁtability and margins on the insurance offeringcompare to the corporate average?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOSo we just launched Tesla Insurance for real-time insurance in Virginia, Colorado and Oregonearlier this week. Maybe one step that I'll share, so Texas is our longest-standing real-time insurancemarket. Based upon the information that we have, Tesla is the second largest insurer of Teslas in theState of Texas.",

And I was readingsocial media on Monday after we launched in the 3 new states, a lot of folks are reporting theirstories of saving quite substantial amounts of money relative to their previous insurance. And sowe're quite encouraged by that. And we're working as quickly as we can to get to 80% of customershaving access to a Tesla Insurance product by the end of this year in the United States, at whichpoint we'll pivot our attention to expansion outside of the U.S.The other thing I'll say on insurance is with these 3 new states, the model is different because weare now the underwriter, and we are also now holding the risk. And so with those states, we are afully vertically integrated provider of insurance from systems and ﬁnancials. With respect to theﬁnancials of the program, it's still very early. And so as the program gets more scale, happy to sharemore information on that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorAnd one side I noticed that we are seeing that having real-time feedback for driving habits isactually resulting in Tesla owners driving the cars in a safer way because they can see the -- they getreal-time feedback on, \"Okay, this is affecting my insurance rate,\" or it isn't. And so when peoplesee -- they can see their real-time score, they realize, \"If I make compelling changes in my drivinghabits, then I pay less in insurance.\" Then they have a very -- like a real-time feedback loop forsafer driving and an incentive to do so. So it is -- actually, what we're seeing is it is causing peopleto drive their cars in a safer manner, which is still also a net good.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOIt's safer on average, what we see in the data, to Elon's point, and premiums are lower. We see thatin the take rate data. We have extremely high retention for customers who experience the product.And I think I've talked about this in the past, this has become a real passion program for us for thesebeneﬁts. It's bigger than just the economics. We're trying to do a good thing here for our customers,save people money and make the roads a little bit safer.Elon R.",

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorRight.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOSo I mean we do claims management in-house.

And so it's full end-to-end visibility. And all of that, to Elon'spoint, we can then identify areas of cost inefﬁciency, feed those back to our engineering teams, andalso our software teams, to actually improve the product. This lowers the cost of insurance,improves reliability of the product. So it's a full circle.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. And basically, the customer experience is just vastly better because if there's an accident,there's no argument. We'll repair it immediately. This is as compared to arguing with an insurancecompany and then a claims adjuster and then a collision repair center. This can be a nightmarebasically.
