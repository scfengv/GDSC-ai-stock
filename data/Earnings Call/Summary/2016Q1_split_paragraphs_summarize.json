As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jeff Evanson. Mr. Evanson, you may begin.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsThank you, Cherie, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2016 Q&A Webcast.I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Tesla Chairman and CEO; J.B. Straubel, our CTO; CFO Jason Wheeler; andJon McNeill, President of Global Sales, Service and Delivery.Our Q1 results are announced in the update letter at the same link as this webcast. As usual, this letterincludes GAAP and non-GAAP financial information and reconciliations between the 2.During our call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These arebased on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially dueto a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recently filed Form 10-K atthe SEC website.We're going to start today's call with some comments by Elon, followed by the question-and-answerperiod. Elon, I'll turn it over to you.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectAll right. Thank you. The -- I think the most important point here that we want to make is that we'readvancing the Q3 -- I'm sorry, the Model 3 build plan substantially. So -- and just overall -- the overallvolume plan, with Tesla aiming get to the 0.5 million unit per year run rate in 2018 instead of 2020. Andthis is based off of the tremendous demand we see for the Model 3, which I think is actually a fractionof the ultimate demand when people fully understand what the car's capable of and are able to do a testdrive. So this is probably the biggest change strategically.I think also, Tesla is going to be hell-bent on becoming the best manufacturer on earth. So the -- thus far,I think we've done a good job on design and technology of our products. The Model S and X, I think, aregenerally regarded by very critical judges as technologically the most advanced cars in the world. And sothe -- I think, we've done well in that respect.The key thing we need to achieve in the future is to also be the leader in manufacturing. So we takemanufacturing very seriously at Tesla. It's the thing that we need to obviously solve if we are going toscale and scale rapidly and make the cars more affordable.",

        "original_text": "So that's -- I really want to sort of send themessage out there to those -- to the best manufacturing people in the world, we want you to come joinour company. And that is going to be the primary focus of Tesla is how do we get super good at makinglarge, complex objects.So that's the -- I think, the most salient point. It's easy to get wrapped up in like a bunch of sort of short-term issues, but I think in terms of what matters in the future, I think that's the most significant thing.Overall, on the short-term stuff, our quarter-over-quarter stuff, I think, has improved quite significantly.Obviously, Model X production increased by a factor of 5 from Q4 to Q1, and we continue to make hugestrides in volume and quality of the vehicle. And I'm personally spending an enormous amount of timeon the production line. My desk is at the end of the production line. I have a sleeping bag in a conferenceroom adjacent to the production line, which I use quite frequently. The whole team is super focused onachieving rate and quality and at the target cost. So that's -- I feel very confident in us achieving thatgoal.And with the increase in ramp, we do feel comfortable affirming the 80,000 to 90,000 deliveries this year.So that's -- yes, I think what -- it's just the rate of improvement with each passing day is very significant.And let's see, finally, I'd like to sort of thank Greg Reichow, who was our head of production, fortremendous contribution over the last 5 years. Greg is still -- contrary to some media reports, Greg isstill at Tesla. He's still with the company, and he's helping with the transition to sort of -- to some newleadership. And we have some, I think, exciting announcements coming in the next -- possibly in the nextfew weeks about additions to the Tesla management team on the productions side.So that -- I'm feeling really, really excited about where things are heading in that direction.With that, let's go to questions.",

        "original_text": "Our first question comes from James Albertine of Stifel.James Joseph AlbertineStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research DivisionThere's no doubt you have an incredible undertaking in front of you. Can you help us understand some ofthe key obstacles and how we should consider those obstacles between now and your anticipated launchof the Model 3 in late 2017, whether it's sort of P&L adjustments that we need to make along the way? Butcan you just help us sort of choreograph how that's going to take place?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectSure. So with the Model 3, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we're really try to take a lot oflessons learned from Model X, where -- Model X, we put a lot of bells and whistles on Model X and a lotof advanced technologies that weren't necessarily for version 1 of the vehicle. With Model 3, we're beingincredibly rigorous about ensuring that we don't have anything that isn't really necessary to make a verycompelling version 1 of the car. We also have a much tighter feedback loop between design engineering,manufacturing engineering and production. And so no element of Model 3 can be approved unlessmanufacturing has said that this is easy to manufacture and that the risks associated with manufacturingit is low. There are many ways to skin a cat, and it's remarkable how you can achieve the same objectivewith a hugely varying degree of difficulty. You can sort of take the analogy and say, if you want to kill afly, you can kill a fly with a thermal nuclear weapon, with a MOAB, with a cruise missile, with a machinegun or a flyswatter. So the end result is the same, but the difficulty is considerably more significant fromone to the other, and the collateral damage is considerably more significant. So having that -- havingproduction be really fundamental to the design of the Model 3, I think, is very important. And making surewe're not adding extraneous features to the 3 that aren't necessary to achieve the production volume isalso extremely important. I'm not going to -- at the risk of this being misinterpreted, and probably therewill be some number of articles that do, I think it's worth explaining sort of how manufacturing a complexobject with several thousand unique components actually works and what dates are relevant. And it's --what -- in order to achieve volume production of a car -- a new car with several thousand unique items,you actually have to set a target date internally and with suppliers that is quite aggressive.",

        "original_text": "And that isa date that is taken -- that has to be taken seriously. So like, the date -- because I'm sure this will leak.It's hard to keep a secret, really. The date we are setting with suppliers to get to a volume productioncapability with the Model 3 is July 1 next year. Now will we actually be able to achieve volume productionon July 1 next year? Of course not. The reason is that even if 99% of the internally produced items andsupplier items are available on July 1, we still cannot produce the car, because you cannot produce a carthat is missing 1% of its components. Nonetheless, we need to work internally and with suppliers to takethat date seriously, and they need to see some penalties for anyone, internally or externally, who does notmeet that time frame. The -- that -- this is just -- this has to be the case because there's just no way thatyou have several thousand components, all of whom make it on a particular date. So the reality is that thevolume production will then be some number of months later as we solve the supply chain and internalproduction issues. But it is a bit of a confusing thing, and it is -- it does create some churn, becausepeople are like, \"Well, what's the real date?\" It's like you have to take the July 1 date seriously in order forsome date a few months later or some number of months later to actually be the real date. So yes, that'sactually how it has to work. So in order for us to be confident of achieving volume production of Model 3by late 2017, we actually have to set a date of mid-2017 and really hold people's feet to the fire internallyand externally to achieve an actual volume production date of late 2017. So as a rough guess, I would saywe would aim to produce 100,000 to 200,000 Model 3s in second half of next year. That's my expectationright now. Yes, so that's the thing. And now, what I would say to anyone that is thinking about ordering aModel 3, now is a good time to actually place your reservation or place your order because you don't haveto worry about if you're placing your order and receiving it 5 years from now. If you place your order now,there's a high probability you will actually receive your car in 2018.",

How does that compare with the volume production-agreed date for the Model X,just as an example? And then how does this flow with your cash needs? As you've articulated, it seemsyou've walked back a little bit from the prior quarter's discussion around cash flow positive and no needfor capital markets raise. It seems like there may be a need here. If you could just articulate how the 2 fittogether, that'd be helpful.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectIt's always tempting for people to reason by analogy instead of first principles, and that's what -- thatwould be the mistake of assuming that anything to do with the X production has bearing on Model 3.They're very different programs with fully different approaches. So I would not try to extrapolate fromthat any more than it would have made sense to extrapolate from the Roadster when we were making600 cars a year to 20,000 cars a year with the Model S. So in the Roadster case, we went from making600 cars a year in 2010, where Lotus made the body and chassis, we made the powertrain and we didfinal assembly. It was a far simpler car than the Model S. I would tell people we were going to do 20,000-- get to a run rate of 20,000 cars a year with the Model S, despite it being a vastly more complicatedcar and a car where we made the whole car, not just the powertrain. If you would extrapolate from theRoadster experience, you would be completely wrong about the Model S outcome, and many people were.That's why it's -- I would say, X is not relevant. As far as the increased capital raise, well, obviously, if youdouble your planned volume, you can't expect the capital to stay the same. I think our capital efficiencywill actually improve on a per-car basis, but obviously, it can't stay the same.",

I'm not sure what would be more compelling -- at least, I think that there's a goodargument that Model 3 is the most compelling program on earth, so -- from a manufacturing standpoint.So I believe to recruit top manufacturing talents to the most compelling product on earth is very strong.We find the response to be extremely good when we call people up. So based on the rate at which we'readding world-class manufacturing expertise and some of the things that I know we're going to announcein the future, I feel highly confident that Model 3 is going to be well executed as a program.

Inc., Research DivisionAs you look at this accelerated plan for production, what can we expect on OpEx spending to support all ofthose cars coming out a lot faster than you had previously expected?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, this is Jason. I think we updated our guidance on OpEx for the year a little bit in the letter. We hadtalked about 20% last year and moving that range to 20% to 25% for 2016. So there's obviously going toneed to be more OpEx at this. However, at the same time, you see how we improved quarter-over-quarterin terms of OpEx. We were down $12 million from Q4, down 3%. So there's a renewed focus in the hallshere at Tesla on making sure we are managing costs extremely effectively. And all of our employees getthat and are contributing to that.Elon R.

On the Model Sramp, my desk was also in the middle of the factory at the start of the body line for a year. So I movemy desk around to wherever the most important place is for the company.

But I don't know,maybe this is a question for Jason. I mean, have you guys -- can you share with us maybe what a totalcapital cost estimate might look like for the Model 3 program now that you've got a handle on what yourvolume's going to be, or what you want to produce to?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, a couple of things there. So one, we've provided some breadcrumbs, like we updated our CapExguidance to -- we had guided at $1.5 billion last quarter. And we think it'll probably be 50% higher thanthat for 2016 -- into 2017.Unknown Executive$1.5 billion.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerWhat?Unknown Executive$1.5 billion.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial Officer$1.5 billion. And into 2017. We're not going to talk about that right now. But the other thing to payattention to is our CapEx for this quarter was $216 million, which was a 47% decrease over Q4. A little bitof that is what we talked about last quarter, where a lot of the big investments from Model X had alreadybeen made. But also, we're just really focusing, as Elon has said, on capital efficiency and making surethat we are investing in the highest and best uses of cash. And I think those principles are what's going toguide the Model 3 program.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionYes, I mean, look, that's a good starting point to work with for us. I mean, we appreciate the update forthis year. Maybe the way to take the question is just kind of understand when the peak spending periodsare going to be. And if you're launching through middle of next year, is it kind of a good idea to maybeextend the amount of capital you see spending kind of in the balance of the 3 [ph] quarters through thesecond half of next year? And then clearly, with the launch, that tapers off. Is that a right way to thinkabout it? And then second to that, I would probably ask the same question just on the R&D front. When dothose costs spike in the timeframe of that program?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure, I think you're thinking about it the right way, the way you've laid it out.",

On theR&D piece of it, that is a big driver behind our updating of our range to 20% to 25% OpEx in 2016. Sowe'll start to see a little bit of that in the second half of this year. And then certainly, some more into thefirst half of 2017.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionGot it. If I can squeeze in one last one, just on the sourcing. Is this changing your strategy of workingwith suppliers? I mean, you've done a lot in-house for all your products so far, but obviously, this is avery different kind of volume number you're talking about. So are you thinking about changing the levelof vertical integration? And how does that work into sort of the ongoing capital requirements for thisprogram?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectNo. I think we're actually going to increase the amount of vertical integration that we have. I think it'svery important for us to have the ability to produce almost any part on the car at will, because it alleviatesrisk with suppliers, where -- going back to like, where if 2% of supply is not ready, we can't make the car.Having the ability internally to adapt and make those -- that 2% of parts internally is a -- really massivelyreduces risks associated with the production ramp. That, I think, is a very important thing. Now once --like, if we get to a steady state and we talk to a supplier and they can do a very efficient job of makingthat part, we have no problem transitioning it from in-sourced to outsourced. I've always -- not to in-source for the sake of in-sourcing, but rather to in-source if we think that it has meaningful improvementon schedule or cost or quality. And I mean, one of the challenges we face is that for a lot of the supplychain, they are impedance matched to the timeframe for the big OEMs. And Tesla just moves a lot fasterthan the big OEMs. And so if they're impedance matched to a typical sort of 10 -- sorry, sort of -- call itlike a 6-year development cycle and we're on a 2- or 3-year development cycle, it just doesn't -- couldn'tconnect properly.

        "original_text": "Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionI just want to talk a little bit about maybe some of the milestones that you see in terms of this accelerateddevelopment and launch of the -- or scale-up of the Model 3. First, it looked like in the proxy that theAlpha prototype was completed as of -- when it was filed a few weeks ago. So a few questions. One,when do you kind of expect the Beta prototype to be achieved? When do you think you'll have firm specsfor both your internal parts operations and for your external suppliers? And then in terms of the capital,do you see -- 2 other questions. Kind of when would you see raising capital, if at all, to meet this? Andthen finally, given the volume of trade-off decisions you're talking about making between manufacturing,design, engineering, do you see any role for a COO-type similar to what you have at SpaceX to accomplishthis timeline?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectOkay, that's like 17 questions in one.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionYou could send us the project plan.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, from an engineering standpoint, we're already almost complete with the design of Model 3. Andin fact, the prototype that was driving at the Model 3 event the end of March was actually using theproduction drivetrain. So I think we feel pretty good about engineering completion of the last itemsprobably within 6 to 8 weeks, thereabouts. The -- so the -- and -- so with -- sort of completing the finalrelease for tooling no later than the end of June. That sort of leaves roughly 9 months for the tools tobe manufactured, which, I think, is an achievable timeframe. It's gets [ph] some suppliers, but it's anachievable timeframe.

BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionWe can all now see, with the Model 3 preorders, that you are entirely correct that there is tons of demandfor the car, just like you've been saying all along. So I think about a month ago, when you startedtweeting those preorders, right, the investor and parts supplier confidence in your ability to ramp to 0.5million units rightfully skyrocketed. With that said, from a supply perspective, you have sometimes haddifficulty in achieving delivery targets because of the issues in smoothly increasing capacity in assembly,and you've shown a strong preference for emphasizing quality over quantity. So is there anything that'schanged on the supply side of the equation that should also be confidence instilling maybe, I don't know,lessons learned from the launch of X or some other factor that should give confidence in your ability to beat a 200,000 to 400,000 unit annual run rate of Model 3 production approximately 14 months from now?Elon R.

But it absolutely will not -- the probability of it occurring isincredibly low of actually achieving it on July 1.

There's no other way todo it. And the things that help us get there are designing Model 3 for manufacturing with engineering,manufacturing engineering and production and supply chain, all in a very close loop, and making sure thatwe design the car to be easy to make, that we iterate with suppliers, and ask them how -- if we're givingthem a design that's easy to make or when it's hard to make, or how do we make it -- how do we reducerisk and make improvements and make it easier to build, this is really fundamentally different from S andX.",

And then as Jason was saying earlier, we're really trying to fund as much of this as possible from operatingcash flow.Jonathan McNeill: We're going to need more than one plant in North America, just tosatisfy North America demand. Elon Musk: It wouldn't make sense to ship cars from California to Europe, orCalifornia to Asia. It's just not an efficient way to go."

The first one I have, Model X production, where are we at right there, because I --we thought all this Consumer Reports issues, that I think it's a little backdated. But can you talk to usabout the state production of that? Number two, on the Gigafactory and the battery size for the Model 3, Ithink everyone's abiding by 80 kilowatt-hours or 75 kilowatt-hours for the number of cars. And how do wethink about actually the Model 3 battery size and what the Gigafactory could support? And then the thirdquestion is, why is Bob Lutz and Jim Chanos -- they keep on saying such negative things about you guys.What do you have to do to get the dissenters to actually believe in Tesla a little bit?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. So I mean, I feel confident that we're going to hit like the 2000-vehicle-a-week target by the end ofthis quarter, of which, on the order of 40% are X. I'm just telling you, that's our internal plan and what weexpect to meet. There's no question, the X is a very difficult car to manufacture. I think it's unquestionablyactually the most difficult car to manufacture in the world. And Bob Lutz would agree with that. I thinkhe said something to the effect that he thought it wasn't manufacturable or something that. It's certainlymanufacturable, it's just a hard thing to fill [ph] for. So I mean, we have some internal milestones that Ithink are -- that we've achieved thus far that I'm pretty excited about. Friday, at 3, we've achieved ourfirst flawless production of a Model X, where it went through the whole production process and had 0issues. That was a great milestone, and we were kind of celebrating at 2 or 3 a.m. Friday, it was great.And then -- and now we're starting to get several in a row that are flawless. And so it's really gainingmomentum very quickly. We feel pretty good about the trajectory of S and X. As for convincing all thenaysayers, I think that will basically be never. There's always going to be naysayers. And I'd just say like,what I find ironic about a lot of the naysayers is that they -- the very same people will transition fromsaying it was impossible to saying it was obvious.",

And Model 3 battery, we're all analysts here. We stirred our straw [ph], dividing by 75 kilowatt-hours. Is that the right thing to do with the Model 3? Or should we have a lower number like 40 kilowattsor 45? And then, you've got the guy with the bolt making that car saying that it's going to be ahead of youguys, and then sell for cheaper than you. So how do I think about GM being able to make a car cheaperthan you versus making a margin on a Tesla with a lower battery cost, if that makes sense?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I mean, we don't want to get into like real specifics on battery pack size, but I think it's fair to say likethe average battery pack size for the 3 will be less than 75 kilowatt-hours. That's...Benjamin Joseph KalloRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionI'm sorry, what was that?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectThe average energy content of a 3 pack is certainly going to be less than 75. It doesn't really need to beanywhere near 75 to achieve the range of 215 miles. So -- but we don't want to go into like -- I thinkgetting into the nitty-gritty is probably unwise. Yes. So...Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, and I mean, I don't think it's probably -- you probably don't need to fixate on the 35 gigawatt hours.We're planning the Gigafactory to meet the production needs of the energy that we know the cars willneed. So there's not a problem in scaling that as we need to. So obviously, internally, when you have --we know the math, and we know what we need to do, and we're on track to do it.Benjamin Joseph KalloRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionI guess my 18th question is, so I'm not a car guy, but -- so I have you guys having 40,000 units of theModel 3 at 2017, and from your commentary, it seems like I need to raise my numbers. But how do I thinkabout that ramp-up from 0 to 500,000 over -- let's push it, from 2018 on? Does it go from 0 to 500,000over 2 years or 1 year? Or how do we think about that?Elon R.",

        "original_text": "MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, I mean, obviously, if we're saying that Tesla will have total vehicle production of on the order of500,000 cars in 2018, it can't be more than sort of 2 years to get there. So now, the -- just sort ofanother -- maybe better efficient [ph] about -- education about production ramps is, production rampslook like an S curve. It's extremely difficult to predict with precision the early part of the S curve. So --because in the early part of the S curve, you have -- it sort of starts off very slow and then it increasesexponentially, it moves to a linear, and then moves to a logarithmic. So it's really -- it's terribly difficult topredict exactly what the shape of that S curve is. And that's where things get tricky because you end upputting quarterly results, kind of bracketing somewhere on that S curve, and depending from where youare on that S curve, it can actually look like a big difference. But actually, it could be a shift of a few weeksbecause of the exponential nature of the beginning of the S curve.Benjamin Joseph KalloRobert W. Baird & Co.

Or how do you thinkabout margins, like because people think you can't make it profitably [indiscernible].Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, we're -- I mean, we're highly confident that can be made profitably.

Yes, I think -- like, GM is not aiming foranything near the volumes that we are, and so that they're -- I mean, despite being a big company, theireconomies of scale are going to be driven by the -- whatever elements are unique in their EV.

Obviously, Jon's -- Jon McNeill's taking that -- has that role at Tesla. And then, my focus is primarilyon technology, design and then manufacturing.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI mean, that's my best guess.

We actually believe that Fremont and the Gigafactory could scale to 1 million vehicles.Whether that's actually wise is a separate question. And as I said earlier, it's going to make sense todo localized production, at least on a continent basis. Otherwise, your logistics cost end up being quiteextreme. Or they start -- your logistics cost start becoming a bigger and bigger percentage of the totalvehicle cost. I mean, that's really why manufacturers build their cars for a local market.
