        "original_text": "But before we jump into Q&A, Elon hassome opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSure. So to recap, Q2 2021 was a record quarter on many levels. We achieved record production,deliveries and surpassed over $1 billion in GAAP net income for the ﬁrst time in Tesla history. I'dreally like to congratulate everyone at Tesla for an amazing job. This is really an incrediblemilestone.It also seems that public sentiment towards EVs is at an inﬂection point; and at this point, I thinkalmost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward. Regarding supply chain,while we're making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious. Forthe rest of this year, our growth rates will be determined by the slowest part in our supply chain,which is there's a wide range of chips that are, at various times, the slowest parts in the supplychain.I mean it's worth noting that if we had -- everything else, if we had vast numbers of vehiclesthemselves, we would not be able to make them -- if everything, except the chips, we wouldn't beable to make them. The chip supply is fundamentally the governing factor on our output. It isdifﬁcult for us to see how long this will last because we don't have -- this is out of our controlessentially. It does seem like it's getting better, but it's hard to predict.So in fact, even achieving the output that we did achieve was only due to an immense effort frompeople within Tesla. We were able to substitute alternative chips and then write the ﬁrmware in amatter of weeks. It's not just a matter of swapping out a chip. You also have to rewrite the software.So it was an incredibly intense effort of ﬁnding new chips, writing new ﬁrmware, integrating with the vehicle and testing in order to maintain production.And I'd also like to thank our suppliers who worked with us. And there have been many calls atmidnight, 1 a.m., just with suppliers but -- in resolving a lot of the shortages. So thanks very muchto our suppliers.Let's see. In terms of FSD subscription, we were able to launch full self-driving subscription lastmonth. And we expect it to build slowly and then -- but then gather a lot of momentum over time.Obviously, we need to have the full-self driving build widely available for it really to take off at ahigh rate and make a lot of progress there.",

        "original_text": "So yes, I think FSD subscription will be a signiﬁcantfactor probably next year.With regard to Giga Texas and Giga Berlin, we're actually doing this earnings call from Giga Texas,so we're in the factory right now doing this earnings call. And the team has made incredibleprogress here. You can see the pictures online and see that there's basically nothing a year ago andthis -- a large -- a mostly complete large factory a year later. So it's really great work by the GigaTexas team. And then also great work in Berlin, Brandenburg with the team there.So we expect to be producing the sort of new design of the Model Y in both factories in limitedproduction later this year. It's always like it's not -- it's hard to sort of explain to people who havenot been through the agony of a manufacturing ramp. Like why can't you just turn it on and make5,000 a week? This is -- it is so hard to do manufacturing. It is so hard to do production. At grossapproximation, there are 10,000 unique parts and processes that have to work. And the greatergrowth of production goes as fast as the least lucky and dumbest of those 10,000 things. And abunch of them are not even in our control, so it's like -- it's insanely difﬁcult.I'm fond of saying that prototypes are easy and production is hard. And arguably, the reallyremarkable thing that Tesla's done is not to make an electric car or to be a car start-up because therehave been hundreds of car start-ups in the United States and outside United States. So the thingthat's remarkable is that Tesla didn't go bankrupt in reaching volume production. That's the amazingpart because everyone else did, because they all got the prototype before the idea was the hard partand it is not. It is trivial by comparison with actual production.So it's always worth noting that of all the American car companies, there are only 2 that have notgone bankrupt and that is Ford and Tesla. So the seeds of defeat are sown on the day of victory, andwe must be careful that we do not do that. So often, if you look at history, so often, the seeds ofdefeat are sown on the day of victory. We will endeavor not to make that the case of Tesla.So let's see, the model lines in Texas -- and mainly in Texas and Berlin will be -- will look verymuch like the Model Ys we currently make, but there are substantial improvements in the difﬁcultyof manufacturing.",

        "original_text": "So for example, the Model Y made here and in Berlin will have a cast front bodyand a cast rear body, whereas the one in California has a cast rear body but not a cast front body.We're also aiming to do a structural pack with 4680s cells, which is a mass reduction and a costreduction.But we're not counting on that as the only way to make things work. We have some backup planwith nonstructural -- with a nonstructural pack and 2170s essentially. So -- but at scale production,we obviously want to be using 4680s and a structural pack. From a physics standpoint, this is thebest architecture; and from an economic standpoint, it is the lowest cost way to go. So the lightest,lowest cost.But there's a lot of new technology there, so it is difﬁcult to predict with precision when does itwork and when do you reach scale production. And Drew's going to talk a bit more about the 4680production. Yes.So we're all making great progress on the 4680 cells, but there is a tremendous amount ofinnovation that we're packing into that 4680 cell. And so it's not simply a sort of minorimprovement on state of the art. There are -- and we went through this on the Battery Cell Day --really dozens of -- half a dozen major improvements and dozens of small improvements. So I thinkit will be great, but it's difﬁcult to say when the last of the technical challenges will be solved.So in conclusion, our team continues to make huge efforts to make our factories run at full speed,which is very difﬁcult. We have had some factory shutdowns due to part shortages, and we hopethose will be relieved in the coming weeks and months. And we're making great progress on fullself-driving. Some of the progress is not easy to see because it is at a foundational software level,and so then it ends up being sort of a 2 steps forward, 1 step back situation. And -- but over time,you do 2 steps forward and 1 step back and keep going, you do move forward.So I'm highly conﬁdent that the cars will be capable of full self-driving. If they have a full self-driving computer and the cameras, I'm conﬁdent that they will be able to drive themselves with thesafety level substantially greater than that of the average cars.Once again, thanks to all of our employees who are making this a breakthrough year for Tesla andan incredible quarter.",

        "original_text": "Thanks, guys.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And we have some follow-up remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin, and thanks, Elon. Just to reiterate, Q2 was a great quarter for the Tesla teamwith strong improvements across the business. In particular, auto gross proﬁt and margin, excludingcredit, increased substantially. This was primarily driven by better cost optimization across ourfactories, good execution against our cost reduction plans as well as increases in production anddelivery volumes.There was some beneﬁt from pricing action mostly in North America. However, it was small in thecontext of the other contributors. Note that the Model S and X program was at a slight loss for thequarter due to the relatively low volume. And supply chain challenges, including expedites,continue to provide cost headwinds.Additionally, it's encouraging to see the progress made on proﬁtability within our energy andservices and other businesses. While there's some beneﬁt to looking at our progress quarter-over-quarter, I ﬁnd it more helpful to look at progress over a slightly long-term horizon. Over the last 2years, our vehicle delivery volumes have more than doubled. This volume increase was madepossible by a steady decrease in ASPs of more than 10%, driven by our road map to increaseaffordability and shifting mix towards our more affordable vehicles. Yet over that same period oftime, our auto gross margin, excluding credit, has increased nearly 10 percentage points to ourhighest yet since the introduction of Model 3. This is only possible because our average cost pervehicle has reduced by more than the reduction in average price. This is a remarkable achievementin the context of the volume growth and ASP reduction, as mentioned, and a testament to the hardwork by the Tesla team.Additionally, OpEx as a percentage of revenue has declined and in particular, SG&A, representingthe work we've done to become more efﬁcient as we scale the company while still making therequired R&D investments to support our future. As a result, our GAAP operating margins haverisen from negative to double digit in line with what we have guided. By managing our overheadcosts and driving higher volumes, our P&L is beneﬁting from the marginal proﬁtability of eachincremental unit, or said differently, we are recognizing the beneﬁts of scale and improved ﬁxedcost absorption.With strong operating cash ﬂows and cash balance, we are putting that cash to use. CapEx continuesto tick up, primarily driven by capacity investments in Austin, Berlin and Shanghai.",

Despite the great work so far managing theinstability of the supply chain, these challenges remain and are unfortunately increasing in painwith the higher volume. As we work through the uncertainty, we want to ensure we do our best tomanage customer wait times as well as the impact these interruptions have on our employees andcosts.And as Elon mentioned, volume growth will be determined by part availability as we have thefactory capacity ready and are in a strong demand position. I'm excited to see the progress made bythe Tesla team as we continue building the business and strengthening our ﬁnancials. Thank youvery much.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRGreat. Thank you very much, Zach. And now let's go through the retail investor questions onsay.com.Questions and Answers:Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThe ﬁrst question from Robert M. is Tesla's website still says Cybertruck production is expected tobegin in late 2021. Can Tesla share more details on the current status of the Cybertruck and conﬁrmif production is still (technical difﬁculty) Lars, do you want to...Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringSorry, we cut out there for a second. Yes, the Cybertruck is currently in its alpha stages. We ﬁnishedthe basic engineering, architecture of the vehicle. With the Cybertruck, we're redeﬁning how thevehicle is being made. As Elon said, it carries much of the structural pack and large casting designsof the Model Y being built in Berlin and Austin. Obviously, those take priority over the Cybertruck,but we are moving into the beta phases of Cybertruck later this year, and we'll be looking to rampthat in production in Giga Texas after Model Y is up and going.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, just worth reemphasizing that the extraordinarily difﬁcult -- extraordinary difﬁculty of rampingproduction of large manufacturing items. The risk of being repetitive, it's actually easy to makeprototypes or sort of handle small volume production. But anything produced at high volume,which is really what's relevant here, is it's going to move as fast as the slowest of the, say, at roughorder of magnitude, 10,000 unique parts and processes.And so you can have 9,999, which is 1 is missing.",

        "original_text": "I mean we were missing -- for example, like abig struggle this quarter was the module that controls the airbags and the seatbelts. And obviously,you cannot ship a car without those. And that limited our production severely worldwide inShanghai and in Fremont. So it -- like it wouldn't have mattered if we had like 17 different carmodels because they won't need the airbag module, so it's irrelevant.So the -- in order for Cybertruck and Semi to scale to volume that's meaningful for customerdeliveries, we've got to solve the chip shortage or working with our suppliers and people just wantto say, \"Why don't you just build a chip fab?\" Okay, well, okay, that would take us, even movinglike lightning, 12 to 18 months. So it's not like you can just whip out a chip fab, just like, yes, I'lljust make a quick chip fab.So some of these things are -- yes, anyway. It is quite a trial dealing with all of the constraints ofscaling a large manufactured object. I think it may be the case that Tesla is scaling. It's -- I think wemight be the fastest in history ever for scaling a large manufactured object. I think maybe the ModelT would have been comparable back in the day, the Ford Model T. Probably, the Internet knows theanswer. But I think we may be scaling large manufactured object at the fastest rate in history. Or I'dlike to know who did it faster, so we can learn from them. So it's worth just noting that, and in thegrand scheme of things, it's not bad.So yes, so Cybertruck and Semi, actually both are heavy users of cell capacity. So we've got tomake sure we have the cell capacity for those 2 vehicles or it's kind of pointless. We can make asmall number of vehicles, but the effective cost if you make a small number of vehicles is the same.Like they literally cost like $1 million a piece or more. There's a reason why you do things atvolume production, which is to get the economies of scale that get us down.So we are looking at a pretty massive increase in cell availability next year, but it's not like inJanuary 1. It comes through -- it ramps up through the course of next year. But even without Tesla --Tesla's (technical difﬁculty) Hello? Okay. Even without Tesla cell production, we believe oursuppliers will be able to deliver about twice as much cell output in next year as this year.",

        "original_text": "And Drew,do you want to talk more about that?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, given concerns over cells bottlenecking growth, our target is to grow cell supply ahead of the50% year-on-year growth targets of the vehicle business and also enable increased energy storagedeployments. So yes, our cell suppliers are tracking to double their production in 2022.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. It's worth thing like if you have a target of a certain number, that doesn't mean it happens likeas sure as night follows day. It's a target. So if there is some calamity in the world that it drops thesupply chain, then it will be less. But the contracts that we have with cell suppliers quote roughly adoubling of cell supply to Tesla in 2022.And we have to juggle these exponential -- there's a whole bunch of exponential graphs sort ofoverlay on top of each other, and small changes in where you are on the X axis of time can quitesubstantially change the area under the curve. So what we're thinking of doing is like depending on-- it's basically overshooting on cell supply for vehicles, and then as we have, say, excess cellsupply in 1 month or another, then routing that cell output to the Megapack and Powerwall. Oh bythe -- if we're -- prior to [taking] vehicle production, if there's a shortage of cell output, for somereason, then we will throttle down Megapack and Powerwall production. So it will be something'sgot to give basically.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringOr if there's a disruption to vehicle production, you have an outlet for the cell capacity.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. There's a tremendous amount of inertia in the supply chain. So if we say to a supplierwe want you to double cell output, well, even doing that in a year is very difﬁcult. And then thatsystem has a tremendous amount of momentum. It is like a [plateau] of supertankers. It's insane.Andrew D.

As mentioned, things will move as fast as the slowest part of the entire supply chain,which goes all the way back to raw materials, lithium and nickel and that kind of thing. And there'ssometimes perception that Tesla uses a lot of cobalt, but we actually don't. Apple uses, I think,almost 100% cobalt in their batteries in cellphones, laptops. But Tesla uses no cobalt in the ironphosphate packs and almost none in the nickel-based chemistries. So on a weighted average basis,we might use 2% cobalt compared to the Apple's 100% cobalt.Anyway, so it's just -- it's really just not a fact. We expect to basically have 0 cobalt in the future. SoI do -- maybe with -- I think probably there is a long-term shift more in the direction of iron-basedlithium-ion cells over nickel. As the energy density of sort of iron ore or the iron phosphate -- mightas well just call it iron. The phosphate is taken for granted. But iron-based cells, lithium-ion cellsand nickel-based lithium-ion cells, I think probably we'll see a shift. My guess is probably to 2/3iron, 1/3 nickel or something on that order.And this is actually good because there's plenty of iron in the world. There's an insane amount ofiron. But nickel is -- there's much less nickel, and there's way less cobalt. So it is good for relievingthe long-term scaling to move to iron-based cells mostly. And I think long term, possibly all --there's a good chance that all stationary storage, that is Powerwall and Megapack, moves iron,which is most likely the case since you do not need to transport it and there's [less volume thatmatch] constraint for stationary storage. So then nickel would be for -- really for long-range roadtransport, ships and aircraft, that kind of thing.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. Let's go to the second question from retail, which is Elon has said that Tesla will beopening up the Supercharger network to other EVs later this year. Can you share some more detailson how this will be structured? Will this be at select brands? Or will they contribute to the growthof this network?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. We're currently thinking it's a real simple thing where you just download the Tesla app and yougo to a Supercharger, and you just indicate which stall you're in.",

        "original_text": "So you plug in your car even if it'snot Tesla, and then you just access the app and say turn on this stall that I'm in for how muchelectricity. And this should basically work with, I think, almost any manufacturer's cars.There will be a time constraint. So if the charge rate is super slow, then somebody will be chargedmore because the biggest constraint at the Superchargers is time, how occupied is the stall. Andwe'll also be smarter with how we charge for electricity at the Superchargers. So rush hour chargingwill be more expensive than off hours charging because there are times when the Superchargers areempty and times when they're jampacked. And so it makes sense to have some time-baseddiscrimination.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. We've been doing that, and it's been working and people respond. It helps with utilization.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. So yes, I think we're -- in Europe and China and most parts of the world, it's the sameconnector for everyone. So this is a fairly easy thing to do, develop our own connector, which, inmy opinion, is actually the best connector. It's small and light, looks good, so standard. So wedeveloped our own connector, which in my opinion, is actually the best connector. It's small andlight, looks good.So an adapter is needed to work for EVs in North America.

It is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors,which is sometimes used by some companies.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringI think it's also important to comment that increasing the utilization of the network actually reducesour costs, which allows us to lower charging prices for all customers, makes the network moreproﬁtable, allows us to grow the network faster.",

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Obviously, in order for this to be -- for the Supercharger to be useful to other powercompanies, Lars, we need to grow the network faster than we're growing vehicle output, which isnot easy. We're growing vehicle output at a hell of a rate. So Superchargers need to grow faster thanvehicle output, so this is a lot of work for the Supercharger team. But it is only useful in the grandscheme of things. It's only useful to the public if we're able to grow faster than Tesla vehicle output.So that is our goal.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And the third question is Elon said 4680 cells aren't reliable enough forvehicles. Is this referring to cycle life degradation or something else? Please update us on progressof 4680s? And what still needs to be done to make them reliable enough for vehicles?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, really, this is about -- we'll deﬁnitely make the 4680 reliable enough for vehicles. Andwe, I think, are at the point where, in limited volume, it is reliable enough for vehicles. The -- again,going back to like limited production is easier. Prototype production is easy, but high-volumeproduction is hard. There are a number of challenges in transitioning from small-scale production toa large-volume production.And not to get too much into the weeds of things, but right now, we have a challenge with basicallythe, what's called calendaring or basically squashing the cathode material to a particular height. Soit just goes through these welders and get squashed like pizza dough basically and -- but very hardpizza dough. And the -- it's causing -- it's denting the calendar rolls. This is not something thathappened when the calendar rolls were smaller, but it is happening when the calendar rolls arebigger. So just like -- we're like, okay, weren't expecting that.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. It's not a like science problem. It's an engineering problem. It's not a question of if.",

Obviously, in order for this to be -- for the Supercharger to be useful to other powercompanies, Lars, we need to grow the network faster than we're growing vehicle output, which isnot easy. So that's a good thing there. And no matter what,we're going to continue to aggressively expand the network capacity, increasing charging speeds,improving the trip planning tools to protect against site congestion using dynamic pricing, and just continuing to focus on minimum wait time for all customers. And the third question is Elon said 4680 cells aren't reliable enough forvehicles. Is this referring to cycle life degradation or something else? Please update us on progressof 4680s? And what still needs to be done to make them reliableenough for vehicles?"

Are you seeing meaningful evolution in terms of the regulators reallyunderstanding the technology and beginning to set some standards here sometime in the near term?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorAt least in the U.S., we don't see regulation as a fundamental limiter. We've got -- we're obviouslygoing to make the work and then demonstrate that the reliability is signiﬁcantly in excess of theaverage human driver for it to be allowed -- for people to be able to use it without paying attentionto the road.But I think we have a massive ﬂeet, so it will be, I think, straightforward to make the argument onstatistical grounds just based on the number of interventions or especially interventions that wouldresult in a crash. At scale, we think we'll have [billions] of miles of travel to be able to show that itis the safety of the car with autopilot on is 100% or 200% or more safer than the average humandriver. At that point, I think it would be unconscionable to -- not to allow autopilot because the carjust comes way less safe.It will be sort of like if you take the elevator analogy. Back in the day, you used to have elevatoroperators with like a big sort of switch that operates the elevator and moves between ﬂoors. Butthey get tired or maybe drunk or something or distracted, and every time and again, somebodywould be kind of sheared in half between ﬂoors. That's kind of the situation we have with cars.Autonomy will become so safe that it will be unsafe to manually operate the car, relativelyspeaking.And today, obviously, we just get in an elevator.",

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureI have another question actually on batteries but on a slightly different angle. I was wondering howyou're looking at your sourcing strategy for the 4680. You've talked a lot about all the work you'redoing to develop your in-house production. But what about asking other battery manufacturers todo 4680 cells with their own technology, maybe less innovation than what you guys are lining upinternally? And I was wondering if the ﬁrst 4680 cells that we'll see on the road will deﬁnitely comefrom Tesla's own manufacturing lines or whether they could be coming actually from outsidesuppliers as well. And I have a quick follow-up.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. We are, in fact, working with our existing suppliers to produce 4680 format cells. And this isjust a guess right now, but I see us sort of like consolidating around 4680 nickel-based structuralpack and for long-range vehicles. And then not necessarily a 4680 format but some other format foriron-based cells. And so we -- right now, we kind of have the Baskin-Robbins of batteries situationwith us. We have so many formats and so many chemistries that it's like we've got like 36 ﬂavors ofbattery this way.This is just -- this results in an engineering drag coefﬁcient where each variant of cell chemistry andformat requires a certain amount of engineering to maintain it and troubleshoot, and this inhibits ourforward progress. So it is going to be important to consolidate to just maybe ideally 2 form factors,maybe 3 but ideally 2 and then just 1 nickel chemistry and 1 iron chemistry and -- so we don't haveto troubleshoot so many different variants.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. And towards that end, we are engaging with the suppliers that we've had good partnershipswith on 4680 designs to enable that simpliﬁcation, and so far, so good. They're working on --they're bringing their core competencies to bear on that. We're not mandating like what's going oninside, but it's been a good collaboration.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. And we do expect to see signiﬁcant increases in supply from our existing suppliers in additionto the cells that Tesla's making.

We have a signiﬁcant unmet demand in stationary storage.Megapack is basically sold out until the end of next year, I believe. We have a massive backlog inPowerwall demand. The demand of Powerwall versus production is an insane mismatch. Now partof that problem is also the semiconductor issue. So we use a lot of the same chips in the Powerwallas you do in a car. So it's like which one do you want to make? Cars or Powerwalls? So we need tomake cars, so therefore, Powerwall production has been reduced.But as that semiconductor shortage is alleviated, then we can massively ramp up Powerwallproduction. I think we have a chance of hitting an annualized rate of 1 million units of Powerwallnext year maybe towards -- on the order of 20,000 a week but again, dependent on cell supply andsemiconductors.But in terms of demand, I think there's probably demand for in excess of 1 million Powerwalls peryear and actually -- and just a vast amount of Megapacks for utilities.

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureNo, my question is from the time you announced like the subscription at the $199 per month, howmuch did like the take rate increase, like the percentage of people who basically took thesubscription as they bought a new car versus how it was when they had to pay $10,000 upfront.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. This is Zach here. I mean I think we're still early in understanding how FSD subscription willunfold, but a couple of data points here. So we took a look at our backlog to see, of customers inour backlog who have ordered FSD, did they cancel presumably to go to subscription after theytake delivery. And the level of cancellations there was we're not seeing cannibalization there. It'spossible that, that changes, but that was also part of our pricing strategy at $99 and $199.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean we -- I think like any given price is going to be wrong, so we'll just adjust it over timeas we see the value proposition makes sense to people. So we're just really -- I'm not thinking aboutthis a lot right now. We need to make full self-driving work in order for it to be a compelling valueproposition. Otherwise, people are kind of betting on the future.I mean, like right now, is it -- does it make sense for somebody to do FSD subscription? I think it'sdebatable. But once we have full self-driving widely deployed, then the value proposition will beclear. And at that point, I think basically everyone will use it or be rare -- a rare individual whodoesn't.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Thank you very much for your help, and I think that's all the time we have for today. Thanksfor all your questions, and we'll speak to you again in 3 months' time. Have a good day, everyone.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorAll right. Thank you.",
