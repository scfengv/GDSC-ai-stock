Our Q3 results wereannounced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as thiswebcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ﬁlings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)But before we jump into the Q&A, Zach has some opening remarks. Zach?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. We're continuing to make great progress as a company, setting new records oneach of the most important ﬁnancial metrics for Q3. Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars,20% higher than last quarter and 70% higher than the same quarter last year. We were also able toachieve an annualized production run rate of over 1 million cars towards the end of the quarter.The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at ourShanghai factory. Additionally, we have made great progress increasing production volumes ofModel S and have recently started the ramp and deliveries of Model X. It will take a bit more timeto get this program back to prior volumes, but based on demand, we are targeting to exceedhistorical production levels. We have also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as ourmain export hub. This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and tointroduce Model Y to Europe.Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at fullcapacity. It's important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this hasbeen exceptionally difﬁcult to achieve. I want to thank our supply chain team for their incrediblework and our production teams for showing impressive ﬂexibility as we make adjustments real-time. This team's expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference whenmanaging through these challenges. Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast withour suppliers as we're adding capacity as quickly as possible. I also want to thank our suppliers fortheir dedication and partnership to Tesla.Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing togrow and average customer wait times are extending.",

        "original_text": "The only practical way to address this in theimmediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our existing production lines,which is where we are focused. Similar dynamics are also playing out on our storage business as we are working to expandPowerwall and Megapack production as quickly as parts and cells allow us to do so. Additionally,we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program, and we're excited tohave expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.Financially, our auto gross margins reached 30.5% on a GAAP basis and just under 29% excludingregulatory credits, which is our strongest yet. This beneﬁt primarily comes from higher volumesparticularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the Model Y as we -- and we have madegood progress increasing Model S volumes. The Model S has now returned to positive grossmargin, and we expect this to increase with higher production and the ramp of Model X.As was the case in Q2, there was some net beneﬁt from pricing actions. However, this remainssmall in the context of other contributors. Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take timefor the impact of recent changes to ﬂow through our ﬁnancials. Note that we are also not yetrecognizing additional revenue from the FSD beta program. Supply chain challenges, includingexpedites, continue to provide cost headwinds as was also the case with FX this quarter. While weare seeing an impact from the rise in commodity and labor costs, we have also been adjustingpricing, which should help to compensate.Overall, as I mentioned in our last call, our P&L continues to beneﬁt from the marginal proﬁtabilityof each incremental unit with higher ﬁxed cost absorption. As a result of the great progress onmargins, volume and appropriate management of overhead costs, we were able to achieve anoperating margin of just under 15%, exceeding the long-term guidance we've laid out previously.On cash, we generated record operating cash ﬂows of $3.1 billion and continue to invest heavily inthe build-out of manufacturing, supercharging and service capacity. We also continue to retire high-interest-rate debt, including the early settlement of our 2025 senior notes of $1.8 billion during thequarter.As we look forward, we are clearly quite a bit ahead of the pacing required to achieve our targetannual growth rate of 50% this year. Q4 production will depend heavily on availability of parts, butwe are driving for continued growth. We are also nearing assembly of our ﬁrst production cars inAustin and Berlin.",

We're working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly aspossible. I think Zach spoke to that well. And we're doing this while trying to add the least amountof incremental complexity to the business. We don't want to add any new vehicles to our lineupwhen we're generally in a cell-constrained world. While there is still more runway to grow theseexisting products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin, Berlin, ramping S and X furtherin Fremont to restore to past levels while also growing 3 and Y production in Fremont andShanghai. As we've mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will beCybertruck.

        "original_text": "The next question from a retail shareholder is, what is Tesla's goal forvehicle production capacity for the 4 current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin, by2024?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of 50% per year.And so you can extrapolate that out. There may be some periods of time in which we're well aheadof that. There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we're slightly lower thanthat. But that remains the long-term goal of the company.In Fremont, we're continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible there. Over the last 12months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production. And based upon everything that we know inthe factory, where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we're targeting to increase that another50%. I think that will be a difﬁcult goal but that's the goal that the internal team has, and they'regoing to continue to push on that.As we look towards Shanghai, we're continuing to push the boundaries there and we continue toramp production there as well, so most recently the ramp-up of the Model Y , which was our biggestcontributor of volume in Q3. We'll continue to ramp that factory. And our plans there with time areto keep growing the capacity in that factory.Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our ﬁrst iterations of capacity there are on ModelY , but we've intentionally set these factories in locations in which they have a quite signiﬁcantamount of land and ability to expand. And so we'll take Model Y at these factories. We're trying toget to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can. And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentiallyeven getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories. And then we'll add Cybertruck here inAustin and continue to grow from there.So our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years and then ultimately, inthe long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year. We're going to grow as quickly as isfeasibly possible with an eye towards a 50% annual growth rate.",

As we have been for years, we always engage with NHTSA and otherworldwide regulatory bodies to share our knowledge and to work with them on our approaches onboth active and passive safety.

What concrete steps is Tesla taking to improve the customer experience in these 2 keyareas?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. I'll take the service part of this question. Drew, you can take the supercharging part. We haveseen an increase in service wait times throughout the summer. And there's a couple of things thathave contributed to that based upon the information that we have. The ﬁrst is that -- and I think thisis kind of not -- this is not unique to us, is that the return to some sense of normalcy in a post-pandemic world has happened, I think, more quickly than most people expected. And what we'reseeing here is that the number of miles that people are driving has increased. There may have beensome demand for service during 2020 or in the early parts of 2021 that customers put off, and sothere's a bit of a catch-up that's occurring. That has increased demand for service. At the same time,in the macro environment here, logistics, moving parts, sourcing parts has become increasinglymore difﬁcult, which is a well-known issue in the world right now, as well as challenges in the labormarket.And so this kind of the simultaneous increase in demand for service with the ability to supply thatservice has been impacted for the reasons I mentioned. And so we saw an uptick primarily inEurope and North America in service wait times over the course of the summer. And we've beenworking extremely hard since then to address this, and we've seen our wait times come down. Sothis is not the case in every location, but if you think about it from regional average perspective, weare seeing improvements there.We remain super-focused on adding locations. And so over the last year, we've grown our physicalfootprint of service centers by 35%. We've grown our footprint of mobile repair by over 40%. We'realso adding stafﬁng as quickly as we can in the areas that are most impacted by the imbalance ofsupply and demand for service.But I think the most important part about all of this is -- and we've said this on calls before, wherethe best service is no service. And so we have been incredibly focused as a company both on theinitial quality of our vehicles and reliability of our vehicles.",

Are there any plans toincrease FSD pricing as wider release becomes imminent?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOI'll take the second part of the question ﬁrst. We won't be providing any kind of forward-lookingcommentary on our pricing strategy or what may happen here over the near term. With respect tothe ﬁrst part of the question, it has been an interesting thing for us to unpack within the company. Imean what I'll say just as a general statement before I make a couple of speciﬁc comments is thatthe things that we learn on FSD subscription today are not necessarily all that relevant. This isreally more of a platform for when FSD beta goes into wide release and the features andfunctionality become more accessible to more customers.The second thing that I'll note is that if you look at the pricing, the monthly pricing of FSDsubscription, and then you compare that to the cost of either rolling FSD option into your lease oryour loan, on a monthly basis, the most economical way for a customer to enjoy the features of fullself-driving is through purchasing it upfront and rolling it through their ﬁnancing. And as a result ofthat, what we've seen in the data is not -- we're unable to detect a change in the upfront take rate ofFSD when people purchase cars. We have seen quite a bit of activity of folks curious to experiencewhat the software has to offer and subscribing to it and enjoying it through that route. But again, asI said at the beginning, I think what we've seen so far on FSD subscription is not terribly relevant.We'll see how that plays out in the future as we continue to release more features.",

What's the timing?How fast is that business line likely to grow in the next few years?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thank you, Pierre. I'm extremely passionate about our insurance product. We have a terriﬁcteam here at Tesla of folks who have been spending a lot of time developing this and probablylistening to the call. So we're pretty excited so far, Pierre.So I mean at the highest level here, we entered the insurance market kind of unintentionally, Iwould say. Our customers were coming to us, complaining that the price of traditional insurancewas too high and it was reducing the affordability of a Tesla. And part of our journey here at Teslais we want as many people as possible to be able to afford our products. That's extremely importantto achieving the mission of the company. And if you look at the price of insurance as a percentageof what somebody's monthly payment is, it's quite high. And we spend extreme amounts of effort inmanufacturing to take $5 of BOM cost out here or $10 out somewhere else. If we can get $5, $10,$20, $30 out on a monthly payment, you can calculate what that means in terms of reduction of theprice of the car if you ﬁnance it, and the leverage of improving insurance cost is huge in terms ofaffordability.And so that's kind of the context by which we stepped into this. As we started to do more research,essentially, the tools by which the insurance is traditionally calculated are optimized based upon theexisting data, but the existing data is limited.",

But what essentiallyhappens here is customers who are low risk and don't actually ﬁle many claims end up overpayingon their insurance relative to their cost. That overpayment then goes to riskier customers who areessentially being subsidized. And as we looked at this and we looked at the data, we thought thisjust doesn't seem like it's fair.At Tesla, because our cars are connected, because they are essentially computers on wheels, there'senormous amounts of data that we have available to us to be able to assess the attributes of a driverwho's operating that car and whether those attributes correlate with safety because we do get asignal when a car has been in an accident. So we've been spending our time looking at hundreds ofdifferent variables and also looking at billions of miles of driving history. And we've been able to ﬁta model that is able to predict, with decent accuracy, the probability of collision over a period oftime.And the model is not perfect, right? The model is a function of the data that we have available. Thatdata set continues to grow. We continue to experiment with new variables, but we do have a modelthat works pretty well so far. And from that model, being able to predict frequency of collision, wecan then align that against the price curve. And we can have individualized pricing integrated intothe car, integrated into the app, integrated into that customer's experience with a feedback loop backto the customer on how they are driving after every drive, the attributes that they were successful onor unsuccessful on, in the tips of things that they can do to improve their safety. So that's whatwe've developed.We then included the safety score as part of the FSD beta enrollment program, where we havealmost 150,000 cars currently using a safety score. And I believe the latest data is over 100 millionmiles of driving. So we've been able to go back and analyze that data. And we've learned 2 thingscoming from that. The ﬁrst is that the probability of collision for a customer using a safety scoreversus not is 30% lower. It's a pretty big difference. It means that the product is working andcustomers are responding to it. The second thing that we've looked at is what is the probability ofcollision based upon actual data as a function of a driver safety score.",

But as Drew mentionedearlier, there are a number of unknown unknowns that we'll need to work through.We are kind of also in this uncertain environment with respect to cost structure. So we are seeingcost increase on the commodity side. We're getting feedback from our suppliers, as we are seeingourselves, the impact of labor shortage. And then logistics and expedite costs just continue to be apart of our story here, and it's uncertain how that will unfold. It's our hope that these thingsstabilize. Exactly when that happens is difﬁcult to predict, and we have been adjusting pricing inline with those changes in cost. And so we'll see how that unfolds over the course of the next year.So it's difﬁcult on gross margin to say where that will go for those reasons.With respect to operating margin, we've been very focused as a company on managing our overheadexpenses and operating expenses. And operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has beendeclining, and I expect that trend to continue to happen.

And I know you guys have done a good job of getting long-termcontracts to sort of mitigate that impact. I mean have you seen so far any impact from that spike?And if not, I mean any sense of when that raw material headwind might actually show up or hasshown up?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. We have seen an impact. Our primary exposure right now is around nickel and aluminum,nickel on the cell, aluminum on non-cell. And we have a mixture of contracts with varioussuppliers. Some materials, we contract directly and we have full exposure to price ﬂuctuations. Wedo have a number of long-term commitments -- long-term contracts in place. We also havecontracts where there's some amount of cost-sharing based upon the movement of indexes. And soas these have been moving, some of those costs have been ﬂowing through to us. It's not asubstantial amount of cost but it's not small.As we look towards the next year, I certainly hope it doesn't play out this way, but it's possible thatwe continue to see more of cost headwind as a result of these movements. It's difﬁcult to sayprecisely, but the volatility and the increases are just substantial -- so substantial. And there arecertain suppliers that, maybe up to a certain point, have been absorbing some of the increase.

Can you talk a little bit about your strategy around anode materials and your ability toleverage that into a reduction on the cathode side and performance from (inaudible)Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSure. I don't know that I'm going to get into too many speciﬁcs, but I guess ﬁrst, one thing I wouldsay is unlike the commodities discussion we just had, like the anode materials are not really in thesame situation just in terms of what their constituent components are. So there's less of a focus onlike rapidly changing them one way or the other because they're generally stable commodities.There isn't exactly like a tit for tat where like get a better anode, use less cathode. Like there's afundamental ratio that you need to maintain for the cell to function.So I guess zooming out, the primary focus on the anode side that we have is just ensuring that itdoesn't, in any way -- that we are able to continue to reduce the cost of the anode without impedingon the long-term cyclability of the product. It can also help with energy density. As you like sort ofimprove the energy density of the anode, you improve the energy density of the cell, not directly 1:1because you have to pack more cathode in as the anode gets better. And that's a focus as well butthe trade space is just sort of cycling versus day 1 cost.Colin William Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior AnalystThat's super helpful. And then just around the vehicle pricing strategy, obviously, there's a lot ofﬂexibility there for some customers and not -- can you just talk a little bit about the process aroundvehicle pricing?

I don't know that I'm going to get into too many speciﬁcs, but I guess ﬁrst, one thing I wouldsay is unlike the commodities discussion we just had, like the anodes materials are not really in thesame situation just in terms of what their constituent components are. So there's less of a focus onlike rapidly changing them one way or the other because they're generally stable commodities. There isn't exactly like a tit for tat where like get a better anode, use less cathode."

        "original_text": "And I mean tobe totally frank, it's caught us a little bit off guard. And that kind of awakening and changingconsumer sentiment, I'm sure there's lots of reasons that go into it, but folks want to buy an electriccar and folks want to buy a Tesla right now. It's very exciting for us.At the same time, we have installed capacity to build more cars but we're constrained by a numberof dynamics, as we've talked about in great detail. And we are putting an extreme effort to build asmany cars as we possibly can. It's hard to overstate how extreme the efforts are. It's quite the grind.We're trying as hard as we can to maximize that capacity and to be able to meet the demand thatwe're receiving. But the net-net of all of this is that we're not able to increase production capacityfast enough.So at the same time, we are seeing macroeconomic cost impacts on our structure, as we'vediscussed previously on the call. So what we're trying to think through -- if somebody orders a carnow, it will -- it could be delivered, in some cases, depending upon the car and which factory, couldbe a couple of months, could be a couple of quarters. And the timing in which we build that car willbe just before that car gets delivered. And what will the world look like at that point? And so we'retrying to think through, how the cost structure is evolving, how does pricing need to change withthat, what are the supply dynamics in the space.The other thing that I'll just note on pricing is that companies change pricing all the time. Thedifference is that when Tesla changes pricing, it's extremely transparent, where that's not always thecase otherwise. And sometimes, our pricing will increase. Sometimes, our pricing will reduce.Sometimes, to the public, our pricing changes may not seem to make logical sense. But there is astrategy that we work behind the scenes as we're balancing supply and demand, as we're also tryingto balance various shortages on parts, as we're trying to manage wait times. All of that goes into theoptimization here.",

No. It's -- by the way, great to hear there's a team at Tesla, not just a one-person show. I want todrill down a bit more on FSD. In December of 2020, in a Business Insider interview in Germany,your leader said that he expected Level 5 autonomy by December -- within a year. So that would benow. Yet we look at the progress in FSD and some of the issues you see on YouTube, and it looksvery much like a Level 2, 2 plus system that requires vigilances, in fact, your disclaimers cite. So Iguess 3 questions, kind of one, what is the timetable to get to Level 4 at least capability? We candeal with the regulatory stuff later.Two, what is the criteria, for Zach, for you to release revenue -- deferred revenue around FSD? Andis having a Level 2 system that needs monitoring enough to release that deferred revenue?And then three, maybe you could talk a little bit more about how you plan to work with the new --with the folks at NHTSA who appear to be asking some questions. They have 3 requests out to youregarding information around the Level 2, around the capabilities of FSD.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks. We'll take them in order. It's difﬁcult to be speciﬁc on the time lines. The Autopilotteam is working extremely hard iterating on every version. We are being extremely transparentthrough the release of this to public customers who are posting information online. So when you'reusing full self-driving and you're going through the iterations, you can feel the progress. And forthose who don't have it in their cars, social media is excellent at getting a sense for how that'sprogressing. And the team is moving quickly with every iteration, with every update, and they'reworking very hard on that.On your second question about the criteria to release deferred revenue, the way that this works iswe have made certain commitments as to what this product can offer at the time that a customer haspurchased that. And so what we have to assess is, have we met those commitments? And is thesoftware widely available to folks that we've made those commitments to within a certaingeography? And given that FSD is still currently in the beta phase, it's invitation-only and it'slimited, we have not deemed that to be appropriate for recognition of deferred revenue.",

I had 2 quick questions. First is regarding the 2 upcoming factories in Berlin andAustin. How are the 2 factories different from each other, maybe in the layout, design, assemblylines?And the second question is related to Cybertruck. Who is the supplier looking at if you look at theexoskeleton steel? Is the supply for that material sufﬁcient for immediate ramp-up, say, in '23, '24time for Cybertruck? That's all from me.Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringYes. Sure. So obviously, as we've noted in the past, we developed our own stainless-steel grade forthe exterior of Cybertruck to meet both the durability and corrosion requirements required for anautomotive world. With this raw material and others, as Drew mentioned, we continue to look atmultiple sources. We have made some early sourcing decisions in that, but I think we'll keep thatone internal, and we've already began the ﬁrst casting-ins of that. Rolling stainless isn't so differentfrom pulling any other material. It's just about how hard the rollers are to get to that hardness level.And just like every manufacturing process we put in for every new vehicle, we'll work with oursuppliers and vendors to make sure those time lines and supply meet the need and demand of ourcustomers.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd on the differences between Austin and Berlin, there are some. They're largely associated withthe different sort of building architectural choices that were -- happened to occur in collaborationwith like local codes and other sort of governing requirements that drive the differences in thearchitecture between the locations. In general though, like we're trying to progress themanufacturing system as a system and make sort of logical, like, path to ﬁnd improvements fromfactory to factory. And in some cases, there was an improvement identiﬁed between, like, decisionsfor one, Austin; the other, Berlin; or vice versa. And so there might be a slightly newer iteration ofone part of the factory in one place than the other, but they're -- it's all part of a -- like a pathforward in the factory that builds the machine -- the machine that builds the machine, sorry.",

We can hear you.Jonathan Edward Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD & AnalystSo Brandenburg, I'm just wondering, Zach, if you could estimate the carry costs from a marginperspective. Or I guess in 2 parts. So when do you expect -- do you still expect production comingon in '21, so a couple of months left in December? And how do you see that margin impact as afunction of the carry cost? And I do have a follow-up question.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOSure. So it remains our target in both Austin and Berlin to be able to build our ﬁrst production carsbefore the end of the year. We've talked about this a bit, the unknown unknowns, new factories, newvehicle designs, new technologies, new locations, new teams. So there is quite an execution journeyahead of us. But that remains our target and all of our plans are oriented around that. We -- for -- weshould not expect for us to deliver cars by the end of 2021 from these factories even if we doproduce them -- so homologation, regulatory reasons. And we'll want to make sure that we build upsome number of cars that we're conﬁdent in the quality and the customer experience around them.The second thing that I'll say -- and I mentioned this in my opening remarks, is because of thenewness here, it's extremely difﬁcult for us to be precise in what the ramp will look like. And it'spossible things -- the stars align and things move quickly. It's possible that we're spending the bulkof next year working on ramping these factories. It's just very hard to say, and we'll continue toupdate you all through these calls and through other forums.As to how that then impacts our margins, that is also difﬁcult because that is a function of the ramp,which is uncertain. So the beneﬁt here, which is different in the ramp of these factories compared toother factories, is if you think about the percentage of our total cost structure in any given quarterthat is associated with new ramps, we have the Fremont factory that's running, generating stable andgrowing margins there. The same is also true in Shanghai. So I expect we'll see some amount ofheadwind on margin from these ramps. It's just entirely dependent on how quickly we're able toramp and what uncertainties come up during the process.Jonathan Edward Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD & AnalystSure.",
