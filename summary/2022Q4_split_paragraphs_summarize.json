Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Timein the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ﬁlings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you, Martin. So '22 -- just going through the '22 recap. It was a fantastic year for Tesla. Itwas our best year ever on every level. Team did an amazing job. It's an honor, of course, to workwith such an incredibly talented group of people.So in 2022, we delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highestamong any volume carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker. While doing so, we generated$12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash ﬂow. Importantly, the Tesla team achievedthese records while -- despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forcedshutdowns, very high interest rates and many delivery challenges. So it's worth noting that all theserecords were in the face of massive difﬁculties. Credit to the team for achieving that.The most common question we've been getting from investors is about demand. Thus far -- so Iwant to put that concern to rest. Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-datethan ever in our history. We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production. So Imean that -- it's hard to say whether that will continue twice the rate of production, but the ordersare high. And we've actually raised the Model Y price a little bit in response to that.So we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as awhole. So basically, price really matters. I think there's just a vast number of people that want tobuy a Tesla car but can't afford it. And so these price changes really make a difference for theaverage consumer. And sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money,they sort of forget about how important affordability is.",

        "original_text": "And it's always been our goal at Tesla tomake cars that are affordable to as many people as possible so I'm glad that we're able to do so. Andyes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered. We're also making very good progress on costcontrol. And we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with thegrowth in production, as you'd expect, so yes.With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed Full Self-Driving Beta to -- for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America. This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Betais the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy. And we'recurrently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways. And our published data showsthat improvement in safety -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear. So we would not havereleased the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year,and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at GigaNevada yesterday. Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cellsproduced internally and continue to use the self cell providers. So to be clear, we will continue touse other cell providers. Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-inﬁnite and will befor quite some time. So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internallyproduced cells. And we've got an amazing plan for making the 4680 cell low cost and high energydensity.So energy storage also saw record growth, and that is continuing to accelerate. That's always worthremembering that the 3 pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric vehicles, solarand wind, and the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind,because obviously, the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. So youhave those 3 things. You can convert all of earth to a fully sustainable situation many times over,actually.So I would like to just make it clear that there is a path to a fully sustainable future for humanity,and we -- our goal at Tesla is to accelerate progress on that path as much as humanly possible. Soyes, so we were ramping up Megapack production. And we expect it to grow at a rate quite a bitfaster than our legal output.So in conclusion, we are taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as wecan.",

So as Elon mentioned, 2022 was a terriﬁc year for Tesla. I also want tocongratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite avolatile year.On a full year basis, revenue increased over 50%, operating income doubled, free cash ﬂowsincreased over 50%, and our margins remained industry-leading. Additionally, we continued tomake progress on overhead efﬁciencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue improvedfurther.For Q4 speciﬁcally, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions as we aremanaging through COVID impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S.and a rising interest rate environment. Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectivelyincreased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly 10%.Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by 3 factors:ﬁrst is raw materials and inﬂation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls;second, we are working through the early ramp of inefﬁciencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell production factories; third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavilytowards Model Y , which carries a slight cost premium to Model 3.Partially offsetting these impacts, we've continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions,in line with the progress we've made in prior years. These improvements include our continuedwork to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles. The energy business hadits strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and commercialstorage. While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on agood trajectory.As we look towards 2023, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.There are 3 key points I wanted to make here. First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customerinterest in our products remains high. Second, on cost reduction, we're holding steady on our plansto rapidly increase volume while improving overhead efﬁciency, which is the most effective methodto retain strength in our operating margins.In particular, we're accelerating improvements in our new factories in Austin, Berlin and in-housecells, where inefﬁciencies are the highest. But we are attacking every other area of cost andunwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability. This includeslogistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads asan example.As the world transitions from an inﬂationary to deﬂationary environment, we expect a strongpartnership with our suppliers on this journey as well.",

What has the initial reaction been to global pricereductions in early 1Q 2023, speciﬁcally in terms of order intake levels? We've answered that one aswell.So let's go to the next one. The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage ofadvanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells/packs, so $3,700 per long-range Model3 and Model Y , it's $45 a kilowatt-hour, for autos and energy products? And how much does Teslaexpect to earn in the coming year from these credits?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some. Long term, we expect these -- the valueof these credits to be very signiﬁcant. You can do the math. If we were to get anywhere near 1,000gigawatt-hours of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very signiﬁcant. So -- butthe credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing. And in the case of Panasonic domesticmanufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits. So it will -- the value of credits this year willnot be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic. We think it probably will be very signiﬁcant in thefuture.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we're expecting in terms of impact to Tesla forthis year. So different products, we think, will get different amounts of credit. The regulations hereare still in ﬂux and there continues to be updates, so this is just our best understanding at themoment. But we think on the order of $150 million to $250 million per quarter this year andgrowing over the course of the year as our volumes grow.And part of the work we're doing here, which is part of what this incentive package is trying toincentivize, is, as Elon mentioned, to move more manufacturing onshore in the United States, whichis Tesla's plans anyways. And so I think we're pretty well positioned over the coming years to takeadvantage of this.But then also part of what the goal of this incentive package is, is to improve adoption from ourcustomers. And so we also want to use these incentives to improve affordability as we think aboutwhat the price points are in our products going forward.

Where do you see average sellingprice and gross margins after the price cuts?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, go ahead, Zach.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes, I'll jump in on this. So there is certainly a lot of uncertainty about how the year will unfold, butI'll share what's in our current forecast for a moment. So based upon these metrics here, we believethat we'll be above both of the metrics that are stated in the question, so 20% automotive grossmargin, excluding leases and credits, and then $47,000 ASP across all models.And so 2 other comments I want to make on this, just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4to Q1. And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in conﬁguratorprices. As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we're delivering cars to at a lower price book giventhat backlogs had been so long for so much of 2022. But then also, there are various programs inplace that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs.The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we're most focusedon what our operating margin is. And so as other areas of the business become more important,particularly the energy business, which is growing faster than the vehicle business, and as we'reheavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efﬁciency of our overheads, we think theright metric for us to be focused on is operating margin. And so I wanted to make sure that I sharedthat with the investor community as well because that is what we're primarily managing to now.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand but I think a lot ofothers maybe don't is that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploadingsoftware, to have full self-driving enabled, and full self-driving is obviously getting better veryrapidly. So that's actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a fewexceptions -- I mean only a small percentage of cars don't have Hardware 3.So that means that there's millions of cars where full self-driving can be sold at essentially 100%gross margin.",

Zach, when do you think Tesla Insurance will becomebig enough revenue source to warrant providing more details in the ﬁnancials of the business soinvestors can compare it to other insurance companies?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. I think it's probably going to take some time before this business is large enough for speciﬁcﬁnancial disclosures. But I'm happy to provide an update on where we stand in the business. Sowe're currently at a $300 million annual premium run rate as of the end of last year. We're growing20% a quarter so it's growing faster than the growth in our vehicle business.And in the states in which we're operating, on average, 17% of the customers in the states are usinga Tesla Insurance product. And that number continues to tick up as we spend more time in markets.And we see most of the adoption occurring when folks take delivery of a new car, as they're settingup insurance for the ﬁrst time as opposed to going back and switching when they already haveinsurance set up. So there's an inherent stickiness in the Insurance business.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorNo, go ahead.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFONo, I was just going to say, just as a broader reminder on kind of the motivation for starting thisbusiness, it was to improve and still is to improve the total cost of ownership of our cars, given thatwe're seeing high premiums of insurance from third-party companies. And that remains our priorityhere. We'll obviously run this as a healthy business, but we want to make sure we keep our costslow and insurance stays affordable to our customers.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. And so there are 2 really important side beneﬁt to our Tesla Insurance that are worthmentioning, one of which Zach alluded to, which is that just by Tesla operating insurance for ourcars at a competitive rate, that makes the other car insurance companies offer better rates for Teslas.So it has a bigger effect than you think because it improves total cost -- or insurance costs evenwhen they don't use Tesla Insurance, because now the [gigas] of the world have to compete withTesla and cannot charge outrageous insurance for Teslas.

Musk - Tesla. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorNo, go ahead. The next question is for Zach. Zach, when do you think Tesla Insurance will becomebig enough revenue source to warrant providing more details in the ﬁnancials of the business soinvestors can compare it to other insurance companies? Zach, I'm happy to provide an update on where we stand in the business. Sowe're currently at a $300 million annual premium run rate."

And previously, we didn't actually have good insight into thatbecause the other insurance companies would cover the cost. And actually, the cost, in some cases,were unreasonably high.So we've actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car tominimize the cost of repair, obviously minimize -- ﬁrst, the best repair is no repair, avoid theaccident entirely, which since every Tesla comes with the most advanced active safety in the world,whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the intelligence of full self-driving for activesafety, active collision prevention. So it's giving us this really good feedback for, again, reducingcost -- total cost of ownership and also just ﬁguring out how to get -- if somebody's car is in anaccident -- most accidents are actually small. They're like a broken fender or scratched side of thecar or something like, the vast majority of accidents.But we're actually solving how to get somebody's car repaired very quickly and efﬁciently and backin their hands. And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars. And we'remaking -- just to emphasize another key point because some of these points might be [less], so Iapologize for being repetitive.But it's remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviouslyimproving the logistics of spare part -- providing spare parts needed for collision repair have anenormous effect on the repair cost. So if you're waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takesa month, now you've got a month of having to rent another car. It's extremely expensive. And ofcourse, you're missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive. So this hasactually a very signiﬁcant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.",

Then I have a follow-up on cost. Is that an accuratestatement?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell -- okay. I mean our internal production potential is actually closer to 2 million vehicles, but wewere saying 1.8 million because, I don't know, there just always seems to be some freaking forcemajeure thing that happens somewhere on earth. And we don't control if there's like earthquakes,tsunamis, wars, pandemics, et cetera. So if it's a smooth year, actually, without some big supplychain interruption or massive problem, we actually have the potential to do 2 million cars this year.We're not committing to that, but I'm just saying that's the potential. So -- and I think there would bedemand for that, too.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystYes.

Can you give us a bitof an indication of the headwind that you're absorbing from those things like you did last quarter?And then lastly, on cost, do you think that we can tease out an interesting data point from -- onwhere battery costs are headed from this announcement that you just made last night? If I'm correct,it looks like the investment cost per kilowatt-hour is less than half of what I've seen anywhere else,maybe $30 a kilowatt-hour for that capacity.Elon R.

If I look back at theCOGS per car, you guys bottom close to $36,000 in the middle of 2021. And then the number wentup as you had to face with inﬂation in input costs and the ramp of Berlin and Texas. And thisquarter, I think we are close to $40,000 and we peaked maybe close to $42,000 at some point lastyear.And so my question from here is, how much time do you think it takes you to get back to this kindof $36,000, which would mean Berlin and Texas? And I think input cost, all that stuff isnormalizing, is that like -- and that would be like a kind of like a 10% decline in the COGS per car.Is that something we can hope to see this year or is that too optimistic?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOThe Austin and Berlin ramp inefﬁciencies in 4680 will make a substantial amount of progress onthat over the course of the year, and that's within Tesla's control. We're doing a lot of work on costreduction outside of that. And we talked about supply chain costs, expedites, logistics, attackingeverything.On the raw materials and inﬂation side, where lithium is the large driver there and this was ameaningful source of cost increase for us, we'll have to see where lithium prices go. And we're notfully exposed to lithium prices, but I think in general, as what we've seen from our forecast here,cost per car of lithium in 2023 will be higher than 2022. So that's a headwind that would have to beovercome to return back to those levels. So I don't think we'll get there this year, but I think we'llmake progress. And we'll continue to ﬁnd ways to offset these raw material costs that we don't havecontrol over.(inaudible), is there anything on that?Unidentiﬁed Company Representative -Yes. Like on the non-cells raw material, we begin to capture beneﬁts of indexes tapering out, butdue to the length of various supply chains, it does take time before this is reﬂected in our ﬁnancials.And while aluminum is down like 20% year-over-year, steel is about 30% down year-over-year, theglobal non-cells raw materials market continues to be inﬂuenced by geopolitical situations inEurope, high production cost due to labor cost increases and energy spikes and disruptions due tonatural disasters like typhoon in Korea 4 months ago, pandemic lockdowns.So we believe that meaningful price corrections will ultimately come, but it remains uncertainexactly when.",

        "original_text": "Thank you. Let's go to the next question. The next question comes from William Stein from Truist.William Stein - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MDElon, you started to answer this earlier, but I'd like to ask this question about the AI elements ofyour business and ask if you could comment on progress around Dojo and Optimus and youranticipation for the likelihood, for example, for the company to disconnect the GPU cluster in favorof Dojo and to have some market achievement in Optimus.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, obviously, with -- because we're still at the early stages, there are big [error pause] inany predictions. It's like easy -- I think easy to predict long term but hard to predict the time inbetween now and then. But it's -- we think Dojo will be competitive with the NVIDIA H1 at the endof this year and then hopefully surpass it next year. And the key there is, I think, what's the energyusage required for a given amount of -- if you're training a frame of video, how -- what's the energycost required to do that training?And we think probably -- we said this already actually at AI Day 2, so it's not new information, butwe do see potential for an order of magnitude improvement relative to GPU, what GPUs can do forDojo, which is obviously very specialized for AI training. It's hyper-specialized for AI training. It'snot -- wouldn't be great for other things, but it should be extremely good for AI training.So just like if you do an ASIC or something, it's going to be better than a CPU. This is sort of, insome ways, like a giant ASIC. And we're able to -- since we're operating one of the biggest GPUclusters in the world already, the -- we've got a good sense of how efﬁcient the GPU clustersoperate and what Dojo needs to do in order to be competitive. But we think that it does have afundamental architectural advantage because it's designed not to be -- the GPU is trying to do manythings for many people. It's trying to do graphics, video games. It's doing crypto mining. It's doing alot of things.Dojo is just doing 1 thing, and that is training. And we're also optimizing the low-level software. Soit -- at a very sort of fair amount of level. So it's just insanely good at efﬁcient training.",

Let's have the ﬁnal question from Adam Jonas.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDElon, ﬁrst question is, is it time for Tesla to signiﬁcantly expand the captive ﬁnco? I mean you onlyhave like $4.5 billion of receivables. It's basically nothing compared to other big auto companies.And then I have a follow-up.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorZach maybe is best to answer that.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. I mean the way that we've been using captive ﬁnancing so far is to plug what we believe to begaps in the market of existing third-party products. And so we have a couple of offerings in Europe.We do loans for our energy business, retail energy business here in the U.S. We do leasing and wedo a small amount of U.S. loans that are very targeted.And so we're using captives to support market caps, as I mentioned. So basically, it's a vehicle tosupport vehicle sales, make sure customers have access. I do think there's opportunity here tocontinue to grow this. We are growing it slowly here. It is a consumer of cash, so we're beingcautious on how we do that. But the plumbing is in place to do a lot more here. And I think we'llhave to see how things unfold over the course of the year and make decisions real time as to howmuch we ramp it up versus ramp it back.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think if we see a severe recession this year, which, like I said, hopefully, we don't, in severerecessions, cash is king big time because it's in such short supply. So we want to be cautious aboutusing cash for loans and that sort of thing for cars. I feel we're in a very strong position to getthrough a recession because we really don't have any debt, and we've got over $20 billion of cash,which is great. The cash is earning a ridiculous return, not a good return, so it's like nontrivial. Andthe interest rate actually in the $20 billion is earning like quite a good amount.And I've made this point on Twitter a few times. I'm sure a lot of people on this call understand thefact -- the basic value of a security is a function of the risk-free rate or we'll see how risk-free itreally is, but the T-bill rate.",

And as that starts to exceed 6%, now you're starting toexceed the long-term return of the S&P 500 and starts to become questionable as to why don't justput your money in T bills or savings account essentially instead of in the S&P 500 if the S&P 500 isvariable and the bank interest rate is not?
