        "original_text": " But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaGreat. Thank you. So Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels. Tesla achieved recordproduction, deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the ﬁrst time. Andwe've seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and our demand is the best we'veever seen. So this is -- [we're talking about] we're used to seeing a reduction in demand in the ﬁrstquarter, and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demandin in Q1.So Model 3 became the best-selling midsized premier sedan in the world, in fact, I should say thebest-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world. The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time thebest-selling premium sedan, has been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3. And this is only 3.5 yearsinto production and was just 2 factories. For Model 3 to be outselling its combustion enginecompetitors, I think, is quite remarkable.In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly 0.25 million Model 3s, so -- which translates toannualized rate of 0.5 million per year.When it comes to Model Y , we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind inthe world and probably next year. So I'm not 100% certain next year, but I think it's quite likely. I'dsay more likely than not, that in 2022, Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.Then with regard to Full Self-Driving. Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress. It isdeﬁnitely one of the -- I think one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that's maybe everexisted. And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty signiﬁcant part ofartiﬁcial intelligence, speciﬁcally real-world artiﬁcial intelligence. And that sort of AI, the neuralnet needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efﬁcient computer that wasdesigned, but nonetheless, a small computer that's using on the order of 70 or 80 watts. So this is amuch harder problem than if you were you, say, 10,000 computers in a server room or somethinglike that.This has got to ﬁt into a [smaller sprain]. And this -- I think with the elimination of radar, we'reﬁnally getting rid of one of the last crutches. Radar was really -- it was making up for some of theshortfalls of vision, but this is not good.",

        "original_text": "You actually just need vision to work. And when [beam]works, it works better than the best human because it's like having 8 cameras, it's like having eyesin the back of your head, beside your head and has 3 eyes of different focal distances lookingforward. This is -- and processing it at a speed that is superhuman. There's no question in my mindthat with a pure vision solution, we can make a car that is dramatically safer than the average[person].So -- but it is a hard problem because we are actually solving something quite fundamental aboutartiﬁcial intelligence, where we basically have to solve real-world vision AI. And we are. So -- andkey to solving this is also having some massive data set. So just having well over 1 million cars onthe road that are collecting data from very sort of corner case rare situations -- sort of like so manyweird things in the world like a truck carrying a truck or a car with -- one example is like a car as anactual example, a car with the kayak on the roof where the kayak has a little weight dangling fromthe front of the kayak in front of the car and -- but yet the car must ignore this and just look at theroad.So it's really quite tricky, but I am highly conﬁdent that we will get this done. So -- yes. Thisquarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of themost difﬁcult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and samedifﬁculties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people haveheard about the chip shortage. This is a huge problem. But then in addition to that, for example, wehad quite a difﬁculty scaling, driving our production in China because we're unable to get criticalengineers there because of COVID quarantine restrictions. So -- which meant that Tesla worldwidewas dependent on drive units made at our factory in Nevada, Giga Nevada. So that was a verychallenging situation.I think we're mostly out of that particular problem. That's just -- those was just 2 of manychallenges. So the team has really done an incredible job of dealing with really severe supply chainshortages.So with respect to the Model S and X, there were more challenges than expected in developing theModel S or what we call the Palladium program, which is the new version of Model S and X, whichhas revised interior and new battery pack and new drive units and new internal electronics and has,for example, a PlayStation 5 level infotainment system.",

        "original_text": "There's just a lot of issues encountered,ensuring that the new factory was, [as also we're saying] was quite hard because we were workingmore energy in a smaller pace. So it took quite a bit of of development to ensure that the battery ofthe new S/X is safe. And we're trying to get all the -- in the cars slowly for the past few months. Butwe're just stacking them up in the yard and just making reﬁnements to the cars that we built. But wedo expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month. And then tobe in sort of fairly high volume production for the X in Q3 and start delivering Model X in Q3 aswell.So I think as we ramp up, I think probably the demand for the new S/X will be quite high. So it'sreally just going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes. Soprobably, like, we're going to aim to produce over 2,000 S/X per week. Perhaps if we get lucky,upwards of 2,400 or 2,500. This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which is just alot of factors outside of our control here. But I do think [these will get solved], so it's just a matterof time, and then we'll be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week. It's a great car. It actually costs usless to produce, a little bit less to produce, but it is a superior product.So in conclusion is there's a lot to be excited about in 2021 and '22. We're building factories asquickly as we can. Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well, and we expect to have initial limitedproduction from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.At this time, we are continuing to ramp production of Model Y in Fremont and Shanghai. In thebackground, we're continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, the Roadster andother products. Thanks to everyone at Tesla who made this year a huge success.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaOkay.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of CoinYes. Thanks, Martin. Thanks, Elon. So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiplerecords in the ﬁrst quarter of '21, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difﬁcult of theyear for many reasons.To summarize the quarter, I think it's best understood by 3 key items.",

        "original_text": "First, we successfullylaunched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the ﬁrstquarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market. Second, as Elon mentioned,although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not yet beguncustomer deliveries. The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningfulheadwind to free cash ﬂows and proﬁt generation.For example, we incurred an estimated $200 million of direct P&L impact relating to this programin Q1, the majority of which is reﬂected in COGS and that's before even considering the impact oflost revenue and proﬁts as a result of the transition. And as he mentioned -- as Elon mentioned, weexpect the ﬁrst deliveries to begin shortly.Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly aroundsemiconductors and port capacities, while the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers didtremendous work keeping our factories running, we did experience high expedite costs in thequarter, and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor interruptions toproduction over the course of the quarter. We believe that this landscape is improving, but it doesremain difﬁcult, and it's an evolving situation.If we double-click within net income. Auto gross margin, excluding credits, improved sequentiallyand year-over-year. This is in spite of the cost mentions for S and X and expedites and a reductionin global ASPs as our cost structure as a company is reducing at an even faster pace. So as we lookout over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly assome of these headwinds we're experiencing start to be resolved.On services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards proﬁtability, aided bystrength in the used car business, operational improvements in service and additional servicerevenue opportunities that help absorb ﬁxed overhead.On energy gross margins, these remained negative for second quarter. This is driven by solar-relatedramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease PPA business. We continue to manage through amulti-quarter backlog on Powerwall. We're working as fast as we can to increase production. Andthis will aid in proﬁtability of this business as those volumes increase.On operating expenses, these increased for Q1, which is driven by our investments in technologyand growth. In particular, for R&D, this includes the structural battery pack and 4680 cells,investments in the new S and X and our neural net and silicon investments.On the SG&A side, we're setting up infrastructure and support for both China and EMEA inanticipation of volume to come there.",

        "original_text": "And as I said before, our plans show that we remain on trackfor sustained industry-leading operating margins.Double-clicking on cash ﬂows. We continue to generate positive free cash ﬂows, and this wasdespite the signiﬁcant working capital headwinds from S and X. Additionally, we are makingprogress reducing various forms of debt. We also invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin during the quarter,then trimmed our position by 10%, which contributed to a small gain in our Q1 ﬁnancials.Taking a step back, we've generated $8 billion in operating cash ﬂows and $4 billion in free cashﬂows over the past 4 quarters. As we look forward, our plans remain unchanged for long-termgrowth of 50% annually, and we believe we're on track to exceed that this year as we guided to lastquarter. Global demand remains meaningfully higher than production levels. And so we're drivingas fast as we can to increase our production rates. As we think about Q2 and Q3, these quartersshould largely be driven by execution on S and X, as we've discussed, continued ramp of Model Yin Shanghai and the associated cost reductions of these programs. And we expect proﬁtability andcash generation to evolve over the course of the year in line with those improvements.And then as we get towards the end of the year, our story will pivot towards the launch and ramp ofour newest factories in Austin and Berlin. So there's certainly no shortage of exciting things for usto work on and look forward to. Thank you, and we'll open it up for questions.Questions and Answers:Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And we'll ﬁrst take retail questions from, say, website.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaSo yes, I was just basically saying that the -- although like right now, people think of Tesla as -- alot will think of Tesla as a car company or as an energy company.

        "original_text": "Ithink we are developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world.Certainly, we appear to be able to use things with full self-driving that others cannot. So if you lookat the evolution of what technologies we developed, we developed them in order to solve theproblem of self-driving. So we couldn't ﬁnd a powerful enough neural net [in terms of a] computer.So we designed and built our own.The software out there was really quite primitive for this task. And so we built the team fromscratch and have been developing what we think is probably the most advanced real-world AI in theworld. And then it sort makes sense that this is kind of what needs to happen because the roadsystem is designed for a neural net computer, our brain. Our brain is neural net computer. And it's --the entire road system is designed for vision with a neural net computer, which is because it'sdesigned for eyes in the brain. And so if you have a system which has very good eyes, you can seein all directions at once, you can see 3 focal points ahead or forward, but it never gets tired. It'snever sort of texting. It has redundancy and its reaction time is super human. Then it seems prettyobvious that such a system would achieve an extremely high level of safety, far in excess of theaverage person.So that's what we're doing. Then Dojo is kind of the training part of that. So because we're -- wehave over 1 million cars, and perhaps next year, we'll have 2 million cars in active use, providingvast amounts of video training data that then needs to be digested by a very powerful trainingsystem. And currently, we use Tesla training software. So we developed a lot of training software, alot of labeling software to do, to able to do surround video labeling, which is quite tricky. Thismeans all 8 cameras simultaneously at 36 range a second per camera labeling video over time.There wasn't any tool that existed for this, so we developed our own labeling tool.Then taking it a step further, obviously, the Holy Grail is auto labeling. So now we're getting quitegood at auto labeling, where we do -- where -- that the trainers train the training system and then thesystem auto labels the data and then the human laborers just need to look at the labeling to conﬁrmthat it is correct and perhaps make edits.",

And really, the only way to dothis is with vast amounts of video data.So then we need to train this efﬁciently. So Dojo is really a -- it is a supercomputer optimized forneural net training. We think Dojo will be, probably in order of magnitude, more efﬁcient on, say --not sure what the exact right metric is, but say, per frame of video, we think it will be an order ofmagnitude more cost efﬁcient in hardware and in energy usage for a frame of video compared to aGPU-based solution or compared to the next best solution that we're aware of.So then possibly that could be used by others. It does seem as though over time -- I mean just anobservation, I think basically is the fact that neural net based computing or AI-based computing isand more and more of the compute stack. We -- conventional computing -- well, perhaps heuristics-based computing is still going to be important, still going to be very important, but it will become --but neural net will become a bigger and bigger portion of compute. So a long story, but I think, yes,probably others will want to use it too, and we will make it available.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRLet's go to the second question from retail investors. The recent price changes on solar roof havebeen discouraging for customers and investors. Could just like share more about solar roofchallenges? And if the outlook has changed at all, i.e., 1,000 roofs per week.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaYes. First of all, I should say that the demand for the solar roof remains strong. So despite raisingthe price, the demand is still signiﬁcantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install thesolar roofs. So production is going ﬁne, but we are [curbed] at the installation point. We did ﬁndthat we basically made some signiﬁcant mistakes in assessing the difﬁculty of certain roofs, but thecomplexity of roofs varies dramatically. Some roofs are to be literally 2 or 3x easier than otherroofs. So you just can't have a one-size-ﬁts-all situation. If a roof has a lot of protuberances or if theroof sort of -- the core structure of the roof is rotted out or is it not strong enough to hold the solarroof, then the cost can be double, sometimes 3x what we -- what our initial quotes were.",

        "original_text": "So in thosecases, what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit and -- but what we cannotdo is go and just lose a massive amount of money. We just got to provide a refund of the earlydeposit.But that's what is, I think, most important about the solar roof situation, which I tweeted about thispast week, is that we're shifting the whole sort of solar situation -- the solar power -- well, basically,solar power situation to there's only 1 product basically -- or there's only 1 conﬁguration. Everyhouse -- we will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall. That solar could either be solar retroﬁtwith conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solarglass Roof. But in all cases, itwill have the power to -- technically, this is -- it's actually Powerwall 2 plus, if you will. The plusrefers to a higher peak power capability.So basically, all Powerwalls made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak powercapability than the speciﬁcation on the website. They have about twice the power capabilityroughly. It depends on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and about arguablytwice the steady-state power of the speciﬁcation of the website. The energy is the same, but thepower is roughly double. And all the installations -- so all installations will have a Powerwall. Andthe difﬁculty installation will dramatically -- or the difﬁculty of the installation will be much less. Itwill be much easier because the power from the solar roof -- Solarglass Roof or the solar panels willonly ever go directly into the Powerwall. And the Powerwall will only ever go between the utilitymeans -- between the utility and the main power panel of the house, which means you never need totouch the main circuit breakers of the house. You never need to touch the house circuit breakers.Effectively, almost every house, therefore, looks the same electrically instead of being a uniquework of art and requiring exceptional ability to rewire the main panel.So this is extremely important for scalability is. It's the only way to do it, really. And this alsomeans that every solar Powerwall installation that the house, or whatever the case may be, will beits own utility. And so even if all lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power. Sothat gives people energy security.And we can also, in working with the utilities, use the Powerwalls to stabilize the overall grid.",

        "original_text": "Solet's say that there's a -- like there was in Texas, there was a peak power demand, and the powerdemand, because the grid lacked the ability to buffer the power, they had to shut down power.There's no power storage. No good point on power storage. However, with a whole bunch ofPowerwalls and houses, we can actually buffer the power. And so if the grid needs more power, wecan actually then, with the consent, obviously, of the homeowner and in partnership with the utility,we can then actually release power onto the grid to take care of peak power demand.So effectively, the Powerwalls can operate as a giant distributed utility. This is profound. I'm notsure how many of you will actually understand this but this is extremely profound and necessarybecause we are headed towards a world where, as we were just talking about earlier, where peopleare moving towards electric vehicles. This will mean that the power needs in -- at homes andbusinesses will increase signiﬁcantly. We will -- there will need to be a bunch more electricitycoming somewhere. In fact, if you go to full renewable electricity, we need about 3x as muchelectricity as we currently have. So these are rough numbers, but roughly you need twice -- roughlyneed twice much electricity if all transport goes electric, and they need 3x much electricity if allheating goes electric. So basically, this is a prosperous future, I think, both for Tesla and for theutilities.Because -- and in fact, I think this will be very -- if this is not done, the utilities will fail to servetheir customers. They won't be able to do it. They won't be able to react fast enough. And we'regoing to see more and more of what we see, say, in California and Texas of people seeingbrownouts and blackouts and the utilities not being able to respond because there's a massivechange going on with the transition to electric transport. And we're seeing more extreme weatherevents. This is a recipe for disaster. So it is very important to have solar and batteries at the locallevel, at the house.In addition, it is important to have large battery storage at the utility level, so that solar and wind,which are the main forms of renewable electricity, can be -- that electricity can be stored becausesometimes the wind doesn't blow, sometimes it blows wide. Sometimes it blows too much andsometimes it didn't blow enough. But if you have a battery, you can store the energy and provide theenergy to the grid as needed.",

And sowhere our Bitcoin story began, maybe just to share a little bit of context here. Elon and I werelooking for a place to store cash that wasn't being immediately used, trying to get some level ofreturn on this, but also preserve liquidity. Particularly as we look forward to the launch of Austinand Berlin and uncertainty that's happening with semiconductors and port capacity, being able toaccess our cash very quickly is super important to us right now. And there aren't many traditionalopportunities to do this or at least that we found and in talking to others that we could get goodfeedback on, particularly with yields being so low and without taking on additional risk orsacriﬁcing liquidity. And Bitcoin seemed at the time and so far has proven to be a good decision. Agood place to place some of our cash that's not immediately being used for daily operations ormaybe not needed till the end of the year and be able to get some return on that.And I think one of the key points that I want to make about our experiences in the digital currencyspace is that there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic here.",

So as I noted in our opening remarks and we've announced previously, soTesla did invest $1.5 billion into bitcoin in Q1, and then we subsequently sold a 10% stake in that. We also allow customers to make vehicle deposits and ﬁnal vehicle purchases using bitcoin."

When wedid the sale later in March, we also were able to execute on that very quickly.And so as we think about kind of global liquidity for the business in risk management, being able toget cash in and out of the market is something that I think is exceptionally important for us.

Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question from institutional investors. The ﬁrstquestion is, proponents of alternative grid storage technologies claim that lithium-ion is unsuited forlong-term storage at scale due to vampire drain. Could 4680 cells address this limitation? Is thelimitation even relevant for charging the energy equation?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Just let me jump in on the vampire drain. That's deﬁnitely not the issue. Good lithium ion cellself discharges less than 0.001% of its energy per day. So it's -- this vampire drain is maybe notthat...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaI just love they call it vampires.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Yes, I think the challenge with seasonal storage is your value proposition drops from hundredsof useful full cycles per year to less than maybe 10 or maybe even less than 5 cycles per year. So it'sjust a different type of technology altogether that would make sense, given that it's more than anorder of magnitude, different use case.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaYes. We've got a long way to go before we're dealing with seasonal technology issues.",

        "original_text": "But certainlya way to deal with seasonal technology would be to have wind and solar erring on the side of more[sublay] latitude and -- but then across a variety of longitude. So essentially, like let's say, in theU.S., for example, if there was a -- I'm not sure if you'll understand this, you can actually power theentire United States with just sort of 100 -- roughly a 100-mile -- by a 100-mile grid of solar. Somepeople don't quite understand like, well, how much solar is needed to power the United States.Almost nothing of the (inaudible) of almost any country in the world.The solar incident is a gigawatt per square kilometer. This is insane. In fact, you took the clear area,just the area or saying for nuclear power plants, the area that is considered not usable because of anuclear power plant is there, in most cases, if you just put solar there, it would generate more powerthan the nuclear power plant because they typically have pretty wide clear areas. So it really -- so ifyou have, say, 25% efﬁcient solar panels and then those are 80% efﬁcient in how they laid out,you're going to do about 200 megawatts per square kilometer. Therefore, [5 straight] kilometers is agigawatt, which might be a typical sort of power plant. It's really not much area at all. And a lot ofplaces can have wind and solar in place.So anyway, it's entirely possible to power all of earth with a small percentage of earth's area. Andthen to transfer that power through high-voltage DC lines with no new technology. No -- you don'tneed like room temperature superconductors. This another room temperature superconductors. Thisis a total -- also another myth. Room temperature superconductors, almost irrelevant, in my opinion,almost irrelevant. Low-cost, long-distance power lines using copper or aluminum is very important.So heating is [ice where are]. So that's current square type of resistance. So as you increase voltage,you can drop the current dramatically and drop the heating dramatically to the point where it is ofminor relevance, like maybe you lose 5% to 7% with a high-voltage DC power line, something likethat.So I want to be clear. (inaudible) no new materials are necessary. We just need to scale this thing up.We -- the technologies exist today to solve renewable energy. And some people will say, well, whydon't we do it? That's because the energy basis of the earth is gigantic, super mega insanelygigantic.",

You've got to put that intovehicles. You've got to put that into (inaudible) storage packs. You've got to put that into solarpanels and Solarglass Roofs, and you've got to deploy all this thing -- all this stuff.But it is certainly the case that we can accelerate this. And we should try to accelerate it. And theright thing to do, I think, from an economic standpoint, and I think an economist to agree is to havea common tax, just as we have a tax on cigarettes and alcohol, which we think are more likely to bebad than good, and we tend to tax fruit and vegetables less. It was the same should be true. Weshould tax energy that we think is probably bad and support energy we think is probably good, justlike cigarettes and alcohol versus fruits and vegetables. This is common sense.And -- but I guess on the plus side, I'm not suggesting anyone be complacent. But sustainableenergy, renewable energy will be sold, it is being sold, but it matters how fast we sold it. And if wesold it faster, that's better for the world. There's no question in my mind whatsoever that the energystorage problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, zero. I want to be clear, zero.I think the bias will tend to be towards iron-based lithium-ion cells. When we say lithium-ion, youwill think lithium must be a big constituent of the cells. It's more like 1% to 2% of the cell islithium. But the main part of the cell is the cathode, the main mass and cost in the cells is thecathode. For high-energy cells, like for example, what we use in most -- most Teslas have nickel-based lithium-ion cells, which have higher energy density, longer range than iron-based cells.However, stationary storage, the energy density is not as important because it's just staying on theground. And so I think the vast majority of stationary storage will be iron-based lithium-ion cellswith an iron phosphate cathode technically. But I think the phosphate part is unnecessary, so is theiron ore nickel. I'm destroying the terminology. Just think of it as iron and nickel. And there's aninsane amount of iron in the world, more iron than we could possible use. And there's also morelithium than we could possibly use.",

Let's go to the next question from institutional investors, which is yousuggested that between a 5x to 10x improvement is achievable in the automotive production versusthe ﬁrst Model 3 line on the ﬁrst principles physics analysis. Where does Berlin sit relative to thatlimit?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaI think we're still quite far away from it. I mean the thing to bear in mind with production is -- forthose who've never done production, they just don't understand how insanely hard production is. Iwant to really be very, very emphatic here. Prototypes are trivial, they're child's play. Production ishard, is very hard. Now you say production at large scale with higher liability and low cost,insanely difﬁcult. But Tesla achieved on the automotive side was not to create an electric car. Thetruly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the ﬁrst American car company to achievevolume production of a car in 100 years and not go bankrupt.So this is -- this -- basically, myself and many others at Tesla had to basically have severalaneurysms to get this done. It was so hard to have no idea. So anyway -- and the thing about makinga large complex manufacturing object is, let's say you have ﬁrst-order approximation, 10,000unique items. And even one of those items is slow, that says you wait, just one. Doesn't matter how-- so trivial. We've had production stop because of carpet in the trunk. We've had production stopbecause of a USB cable. At one point, for Model S, the -- we literally raided every electronics storein the Bay Area. For a few days there, nobody could buy a USB cable in the Bay Area because wewent and bought them all to put them in the car, literally.And there's like hundreds of stories like that. So anyway, that -- solving that -- those constraints anda logistics problem that makes World War II look trivial. I'm not kidding. Like the scale is insane.We're talking millions of cars, massive global supply chain, 50 countries, dozens of regulatoryregimes. It's insane.

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureI'd love to get actually based on what you presented on the Battery Day. In the last 6, 7 months, Iwant -- I was wondering how much progress you've made on that front, ﬁrst, in terms of processdevelopment. So how are things coming together on your pilot line? Are you getting to the kind ofproduction throughput you were aiming for?And second and actually on your production ramp. So I was wondering in which sites you'reramping production capacity for the 4680 cell and where you stand on ramping up that capacity aswell. And I have a quick follow-up on energy as well if that's possible.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaWell, so we have the -- and Drew can add to this. But we have the -- a small sort of pilot plant,which is still big by normal standards, expected to have like a 10-gigawatt hour per year capabilityin Fremont, California. And we made quite a few cells. We're not quite yet at the point where wethink the cells are reliable enough to be shipped in cars, but we're getting close to that point. Andthen we've already ordered most of the equipment for battery production in Berlin and then much ofit for Austin as well. So we really don't ﬂick the nitty-gritty elements. But overall, I think we stillfeel quite optimistic about this achieving volume production of the 4680 next year. What do youthink?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, thanks. Just one thing I would add is there's been a lot of questions about yields. Actually, Inoticed people asking about that. The yield progress has been really strong every day, and we werereally still in commissioning phase. We were really still in commissioning phase with most of thetools to the point where we're conﬁdent that the yield trajectory aligns with our internal costprojections. We did talk about yield also at Battery Day, which is one of the reasons why it's usefulto check in on that. It takes a while, as Elon just mentioned, to go from prototype to production.And it's not just parts. It's processes, it's equipment. But as we've matured the process equipment,we've gotten to where we need to be on the yield side.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc.",

The key thing that I say here, there's a lot of potential for recurring revenue based on FSDsubscription. If you look at the size of our ﬂeet and you look at the number of customers who didnot purchase FSD upfront or on a lease and maybe want to experiment with FSD, this is a greatoption for them.One of the things we'll need to keep an eye on is a potential transition from cash purchases of FSDsubscription over to -- or cash purchases of FSD who may move over to FSD subscription. And sothere could be a period of time in which cash reduces in the near term and then as the portfolio ofsubscription customers builds up, then that becomes a pretty strong business for us over time.

I think we've gotten from Battery Day a pretty good feel about thepotential for COGS reduction related to powertrain. But I'd like to get a sense of the path toreducing COGS, ex powertrain, as you'd still need a meaningful reduction on that front to make themath work on a $25,000 vehicle.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaI mean I think all of the above.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, I mean on the vehicle side, there's plenty of opportunity as well. Obviously, building a car likea Model S lot is quite complex and has various moving parts. Model 3 and Model Y were steps ofimprovement in that. But when you look at some of the other advancements that we're including inthe Model Y , factories into Austin and Berlin, we've reduced the body count by as much as 60%,and the park cost money. So we continue to ﬁnd optimizations there as well as we get theeconomies of scale when we start to talk about the volumes we're considering worldwide with 4factories building the same vehicle. So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve ourCOGS as well, and powertrain continues to be integrated into that.Dan Meir Levy - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystGreat.
