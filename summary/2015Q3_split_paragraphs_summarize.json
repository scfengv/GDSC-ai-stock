As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.I'd now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jeff Evanson, Head of Investor Relations. Sir,please begin.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsOkay. Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's third quarter Q&A webcast. I'mjoined today by Elon Musk, Tesla's Chairman and CEO; J.B. Straubel, our CTO; and Deepak Ahuja, Tesla'sCFO.Our Q3 results are announced in the shareholder letter at the same link as this webcast. As usual, thisletter includes GAAP and non-GAAP financial information and reconciliations between the 2.During our call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These arebased on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially dueto a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent Form 10-Q filed withthe SEC.And now Liz, let's go to the first question, please.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectSure, I can probably...Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsOh, do you have some...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI can [indiscernible] to make some comments.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsYes, actually, Liz, we'll have our CEO, Elon, make some initial comments. Go ahead, Elon.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI just wanted to note that we've made 2 fairly significant hires, the first of which is Jason Wheeler. Hewill be our CFO starting next month. Deepak and Jason will be working closely together for the firstfew months to have a smooth transition. And once again, I'd like to thank Deepak for his awesomecontribution to Tesla.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThank you, Elon.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectAnd so Jason comes to us from Google, where we was basically #2 finance guy at Google responsible fortheir global finance function, and I just thought he was the super smart guy and really understood whatwe're doing and was like a very cultural fit with the company. So I think that's going to be great.And then, in addition, Jon McNeill has joined as Head of Global Sales And Service. And Jon is the formerCEO of Enservio. He's been named sort of Most Admired CEO in the small and mid-size company category.In fact, I believe, this is the first time in maybe a decade or more that Jon actually has not been head ofthe company that he was working at, so -- and before Enservio, he co-founded Sterling Collision, which --where, he was able to reduce industry repair times by 90%.",

And he's actually -- he's been doing great. He's been working now part time at Tesla for afew months and just started full time and has already done a lot of good.So I'm pretty excited about those 2 people joining the team, and we expect to have some additionalannouncements in the months to come as we add bench strength to the Tesla management team.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsOkay. Thank you, Elon. All right, Liz, why don't we go to the first caller, please?",

        "original_text": "Our first question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionOh, great. In the press release, you seem to address this a little bit, but there has been a lot of chatterabout cancellations for orders for the X, I mean -- and I think the press release says Signature Series. Isthat across the models? And how should we think about the different versions of the X rolling out over thenext couple of quarters?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYou want to talk to that?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, I don't think there's been anything fundamentally different. I mean, so far, on the Signature SeriesModel X, we've seen a much higher -- or a higher conversion rate than we had seen on the [indiscernible]launched S. So overall, the demand for the X, after the launch of the X, and -- has been higher. So I -- wedon't see any fundamental issues.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I mean, as we've talked about before, really, the main thing with the X is just scaling up production.We're making steady progress with each passing week. Actually, I -- 7 days a week, every day, I get anupdate on manufacturing progress and what the issues are. And we see no fundamental issues on theproduction ramp. It's just a question of how quickly we can solve each issue. And they're really downto like the little things, like the placement of the seal on the door and whether that results in the brighttrim [ph] alignment being correct. This is quite nuanced. So we feel very confident at being able to get toseveral hundred vehicles per week by the end of the year.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionOkay. And can you give an update on stationary storage? Is that still trending to your target of 2 to 5billion [ph] by 2017? And I think the release mentioned that there are some institutional orders. I mean,are there any noteworthy orders that you would want to call out in -- on the storage side that we shouldkind of look at as being big drivers? And are you still confident in your sort of 15% gross margin for that[indiscernible]?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectSo that was like a whole bunch of questions. The -- with respect to stationary storage, I mean, the --that is, again, sort of a production limited thing.",

        "original_text": "So we're trying to scale our production as much aspossible. I mean, we've -- by almost any metric -- we're -- if we imagine the most we could possiblymake in 2016, we've already sold out of that. Or at least, if you were to take even a small fraction ofthe number of people that have placed orders and assume that those orders are valid, even if a smallportion of those are valid, we would be sold out of all of 2016 production, maybe well into 2017. Soit's really mostly about predicting our production rate, and yes, we expect very dramatic increases inthe stationary storage production. The reason I feel a bit cautious about giving exact estimates is thatwhen you have an exponential increase, the exact calendar window over which the -- that you place thatexponential, has quite a big impact on the numbers. So -- and in fact, in general, at Tesla, I want to bea little more cautious about giving quarterly numbers, particularly when we have very dramatic ramps,like the example is with the Model X. You can imagine, if you have strict calendar windows and you placethem over the beginning of an exponential, or slightly to the right or slightly more to the right, the actualdifferences are quite dramatic. So like you know where it's going to end up, but not what it looks like inthat rapidly changing S curve situation. Yes, so...Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionAnd then, on the margins side, is that still on target? And that's it.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectSorry, on the -- you're breaking up a little bit. On the margins?Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionThe gross margin, is it still at your -- or is it still trending to the 15% target I think you mentioned on thelast call?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectOh, 15%, yes. Mostly -- we -- yes, I don't think there's going to be any problem hitting a 15% margintarget. Obviously, the margin improves as the production ramps up, so yes.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, I don't know if I want to discuss the specific margin targets, but it should be in excess of 15%. That isour internal target.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I mean -- Yes. once you get away from the very early stage of production, I think, long term margin15% is no problem.",

Just a point of clarification, first, on the announcement of the 40,000 vehicles that you rolled theAutopilot feature out to over the air. Can you just clarify, once rolled it's out over the air, is there, then, apoint at which the consumer has to determine to spend, I think it's $2,500, to activate it? And is there anydetail you can provide us on those that are paying to activate the Autopilot feature at this time?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectMost people who ordered the car actually ordered with the Autopilot convenience features. So theAutopilot safety features are default on -- in all vehicles. This is automatic emergency braking, sidecollision avoidance, forward-collision warning, that kind of thing. The convenience features like Autosteer,Autopark, are $2,500, but like most people have actually -- had actually already ordered that. So thosethat hadn't -- haven't ordered it can actually turn it on for -- it's actually slightly more if you get it afterthe fact, for -- turn it on for $3,000. And that's something that we'll be allowing people to do at somepoint in the coming months, sort of like an in-app purchase, I guess, yes.James Joseph AlbertineStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research DivisionOkay, great. Then I wanted to ask a question as it relates to -- now that we're past sort of the, as Iunderstood it, the peak spending period in advance of the Model X launch, how should we think aboutcapital expenditures and -- or cash flow models for the fourth quarter? And maybe it sounds like you'vereiterated the positive free cash flow guide you had originally stated earlier this year. But just somethoughts as it relates to the cash flows in the fourth quarter would be great.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, I mean, Q4, we are still in the peak of our Model X investments. A lot of our equipment and tooling isbeing paid off in Q4, as the production are proving out their production -- sorry, suppliers are proving outtheir production tooling as well as the equipment is getting installed and getting signed off in our factory.So Q4 is going to be a peak for Model X. Clearly, 2016 our CapEx should be less than 2015, and then, we'llprovide you further guidance on that in the next earnings call.James Joseph AlbertineStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research DivisionAnd -- oh, sorry, go ahead.Elon R.",

Let's move on. I mean, it's just odd because you normally -- orI've never heard you punt like that, that's all. But in any case, is it because of a competitive sensitivity?

A couple of questions, just one on the battery side. I think a lot of us were surprised atthe GM Analyst Day. They put a slide up which said that they were working on a battery that was $145a kilowatt hour. That probably didn't include the pack cost, but even adjusting for that, that seemed likea pretty low number. And I don't know, maybe J.B., how did you guys react to that presentation? Is itrealistic? I mean, are you worried about the threat of a large form-factor battery being the same cost asyours within kind of a 1- to 2-year time frame, would be my first question.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, we definitely read the report and we're not terribly concerned about it. I think, also, there was a lotof confusion in that particular report and some of the comments following about sell price versus packcost. And in general, we're quite comfortable in our position with the type of cells and the form factorswe're using.

Just first on Model X, I just wanted to confirm, did you say you thoughtyou can get a few hundred produced and delivered by year-end? And just so that we understand what'sbeen happening here, is it just the seat at this point? Or are there other unique challenges that you thinkprospectively affect the ramp of the vehicle?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectNo, to be precise, I said several hundred per week, that we expect to reach the production rate of severalhundred per week next month. And it's difficult to predict the exact number that will be developed,because it -- because of what I was mentioning earlier of like we're on kind of an exponential ramp. Soexactly -- one week this way or that can actually make a significant number -- significant impact in theabsolute number of vehicles delivered. But we do feel comfortable, at this point, of reaching the severalhundred per week production rate before the end of the year, i.e., next month. And the issues are a bunchof little things. I mean, doors seals right now is a challenge, for example. The monopost seat in the secondrow is still a challenge, but less of a challenge. It's not the gating factor.

Inc., Research DivisionCan you talk a little bit about the acceleration in the ramp of the Gigafactory? What are you seeing atthis point in terms of your ability to fully accelerate in 2016? And when do you think, we might see cellscoming out of the factory and into cars?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, in particular, as we have mentioned, we've accelerated the production of Tesla Energy products atthe Gigafactory. So that's what has started just recently there, and that was quite a bit ahead of plan.That's happening in a separate section of the factory from where the cells will be produced, but also, aswe discussed, we do expect that cell production will start up the second half of next year, which is, again,a little bit ahead of plan. And some of those cells would initially be allocated toward Tesla Energy products.And we still are targeting around 2017 for the first cell production that would be going into vehicles andinto the Model 3. So that remains on target.Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionAnd then, just in terms of the dynamics around leasing. Are you seeing any real meaningful changes interms of overall lease take rates? Or a change in ownership kind of dynamics at this point?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerWe are seeing a slight increase in the lease take rate in North America. And as we indicated in the letter,that increase has been fully consumed or taken up by our bank leasing partners rather than Tesla directleasing. So whether we do resale value guarantee or leasing, from our perspective, it's no different and it'sa consumer preference. So there's nothing deep or significant that we are seeing in that trend.",

First, again, on the 4Q, you talkedabout building up finished goods inventory. We don't have the file numbers yet, but for the last quarterproduction outpaced deliveries, and you're guiding to that for 4Q. So what's going to be different in termsof hitting that ramp-up on deliveries for Model S in 4Q vis-à-vis drawing down that inventory?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYou're referring -- so for model S?Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionYes, for Model S.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, I mean, as we indicated in the letter, we were carrying higher finished goods inventory that was intransit at end of Q3 to support those higher deliveries in Q4, and it's the drawdown of that extra inventorythat allows us to do that. Our ending inventory at Q4 is going to be no different than what we have hada few quarters back. So it's still a fairly good level to support all our -- all of our marketing and sales andservice activities. So overall, the increase is demand-based, and it's fully doable. I think I've answered thequestions fully. Yes, go ahead.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionYes, and to clarify just the Model X pricing, is that based on range and features? Or is it just based onbattery size, the $5,000 difference?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerFor a comparably equipped car with greater [ph] features.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. And there's -- so equipped would mean battery or range or...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, yes, so with the same battery and the same number of seats and that kind of...Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionYes, and final question, and maybe this is one for Jason and Deepak. Elon, conversation is autos are avery capital-intensive business. I mean, as much as you're pursuing a different model on the battery side,it looks like there's a lot of capital going into tooling and all these complicated mechanical things, not tomention service. As you kind of think forward 3 years, is that, more or less, the way you're going to spendcapital? Or is there anything you could do to kind of be more asset-light in the process?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerI mean, I think, stepping back, maybe the better way to look at it is that at Tesla our CapEx spend forwhat we are achieving, in my mind, has been really efficient in the industry.Elon R.",

And so -- and as we look at every year, and as we add incremental capacity and the CapEx relatedto that, we are continuing to increase on that efficiency in terms of CapEx dollars per unit of production.So fully agree this is an asset-intensive business, and the key here, in terms of a dollar [ph] investment, ishow efficient we are with that capital, and that's what we are focused on.Elon R.

I guess, consistent with a lot of your commentary recently, you called out in the shareholder justwanting to emphasize quality on the Model X, and it sounds like it's warranting a little bit slower ramphere in the near term. With what you've gone through over the past few years in bringing this car tomarket, does this change your thinking at all over the longer term when you think about the pace at whichyou'll bring Model 3 to market relative to longer-term targets that are out there?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, I think we're still aiming to have Model 3 in about 2 years. So but I think the cadence of futureproducts should improve, as we have more resources to shorten the critical path on things that, like I wasmentioning earlier, like stamping tools and molding dies and the things that tend to drive our schedule.Because from the point which the car is designed, it can take almost 2 years to get fully tooled up. Thatseems like a crazy amount of time to us, and we want to try to reduce that significantly.",

Incorporated, Research DivisionElon, could you talk a little bit, as you guys have increased your sophistication around the market, whatyou think the addressable market is for the S going forward? And then, could we talk a little bit aboutgetting to 20%-or-above gross margin on the X? What kind of volumes we need? And then third, canwe touch on the energy storage industry? One thing that I hear a lot in the marketplace is that it's acommodity business. J.B., could you touch on that, and anything you're seeing there? And Elon, last timeon the call, you threw out some pretty big numbers for energy storage.Elon R.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectHow many questions do we talk about here.Benjamin Joseph KalloRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionAnd I don't think that people really gave you a lot of credit there. So could you just talk about what backsup those numbers?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI mean, I think it's just basically, as we mature in various markets around in the world, then, sort of thequestion's how long does it take to mature in these markets? Some markets are a lot harder to solvethan others, and then, there's also macro economic conditions. Will there be a recession or whatnot? Willthere be -- when will there be a recession? And so these all will obviously make a difference. But I mean,I think, in the long term, there's probably close to $100,000 a year -- sorry, 100,000 vehicles a year of Sdemand and maybe something comparable to -- for X, holding economic conditions constant and assumingfull market maturation, which could take like quite a long time in some markets.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerAnd maybe to your energy storage question, I mean, obviously, energy is a commodity market, but I don'tthink that in any way really changes the opportunity there. In some ways, that's sort of what creates itand creates the...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectIt makes it bigger.Jeffrey B.
