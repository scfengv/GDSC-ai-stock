        "original_text": "Yes, your line is open.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsAll right. Thank you. All right. We apologize, everyone. Elon, over to you.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderAll right. Thank you. My apologies. We actually tried a new audio system with a bunch of individual mics.That seems to have malfunctioned, so we went back to standard conference call object. Anyway, just wantto confirm, people can hear what I am saying. Okay, great.So first of all, let me say that Friday night was an amazing time for Tesla. It was the -- one of the mostimportant days in the history of the company. It's one we've been striving for, for 14 years. It's the carthat we've -- the Model 3 -- hanging with us [ 30 ] production Model 3s was just an incredible milestone inthe company's history. We wanted to make a great, affordable electric car, which is the fundamental thingthat is missing.We wanted to make that from day one. And if we could only have done it sooner, we would have. And I'mglad that this day has come. What we have ahead of us, of course, is an incredibly difficult productionramp. Nonetheless, I think we've got a great team. And I'm very confident that we'll be able to reach aproduction rate of 10,000 vehicles per week towards the end of next year. And we remain, we believe, ontrack to achieve a 5,000-unit week by the end of this year.So I would simply urge people to not get too caught up in what exactly falls within the exact calendarboundaries of a quarter, one quarter over the next, because when you have an exponentially growingproduction ramp, slight changes of a few weeks here or there can appear to have dramatic changes, butthat is simply because of the arbitrary nature of the -- of when a quarter ends.So -- but what people should absolutely have 0 concern about, 0, is that Tesla will achieve a 10,000-unitproduction week by the end of next year. So if you can associate where we came from, the Roadster, wewere making only 600 units a week, where the nonpowertrain portion of the car was made by Lotus. Andwe did the powertrain and the final assembly of the car, and then we went from that to 20,000 units ayear of the Model S, a far more complex car where we did the whole thing. And then we -- with Model 3,we were more vertically integrated.",

        "original_text": "I think people should really not have any concerns that we won't reachthat outcome from a production rate.We're also very confident about costs. We feel we gained a lot of experience. We certainly aspire tolearn from mistakes of the past. And I think we largely have. Deepak will go into some of our marginexpectations there. And unlike, say for example, the Model X, where the mistake that we made, Iobviously take primary responsibility here, was having far too much advanced technology in version 1 of aproduct, it's an -- Model X is an incredible car, but it was overreaching for the first generation of a product.But in the case of the Model 3, we've strived hard to simplify and make sure that it has everything that'snecessary to be a fantastic car. If you see the reviews, the reviews are -- you really could -- one could notask for better reviews.And I'll just sort of give you one little anecdote, which was -- which I found quite surprising is that whenwe were giving test drives to -- or tests -- the journalists were doing -- were driving the car and doing testdrives. About 80% of the journalists said that they would buy the car themselves. Most of the remaining20% said probably. This is crazy. I've never seen anything like it. So this is a very good sign.It should also be noted that one of our big concerns was that Model S, particularly, and Model X demandwould suffer with the introduction of the 3. In fact, this has turned out to be the opposite situation. ModelS and X demand increased with the release of 3.Jon, would you like to just elaborate on that? There was -- we did express this as a concern, and it was abig concern, but it has turned out to be a pleasant surprise.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceYes, I think that's right. Not only, as Elon said, we expressed it as a concern. We had positive comps bothyear-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and in orders in the second quarter. But since then, orders haveaccelerated in July as we noted in our shareholder letter. And it accelerated further since the handoverevent on Friday for the Model 3.So it kind of shows that S and X as our flagship products have a strong position in the market and strongdemand. And that's super encouraging that we've got those -- a strong product lineup with 3 cars that areproving to be very popular in their individual segments.Elon R.",

In fact, I don't know -- I think we mentioned some of this in the earnings letter ,but just some of thekey stats on July orders for S and X were...Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceYes. July orders were 15% higher than our Q2 average weekly order rate, so we've accelerated off of Q2into July. And as we noted in the shareholder letter, deliveries grew by 53% compared to the Q2 '16 ina flat luxury vehicle market. So we're gaining share in a flat to market down -- to down market, and theorder rate's accelerated.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. So July was one of our best months ever.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceYes.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderAgain, contrary to our expectations, I want to emphasize. Of course, we know who knows if this willcontinue, but all indications are that it will, so that's very exciting.As a side note, we're also making great progress on our internal Autopilot software. It's getting better andbetter. I'm really, really excited. I test drive the latest development release as soon as it comes out, andI'm like, this is really getting to be something special. Because, yes, it's really -- and I think it's going toaccelerate from here. And the talent that we're seeing drawing on the technical side for Autopilot is reallyworld class. I don't think there's -- it's unmatched anywhere, I would say.So let's see then. Model 3 orders are -- net-net orders, there's not that many cancelations, there areabout 1,800 a day. It's important to emphasize, there -- you can't see the car unless you want to look atpictures online, you can't test drive the car. You have to put down a $1,000 deposit.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceWe're not promoting the car.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWe're not promoting the car. If you go to our stores, we don't even want to talk about it really and --because we want to talk to about the thing that we can supply. If somebody orders a Model 3 now, it'sprobably late next year before they get it. We want to give people the car, orders to take maybe a 1- or 2-month wait for an S or an X. And I think the point that we're trying to make that the S is still a superiorsedan seems to come through -- and it is true.",

        "original_text": "Things get a little confusing because of the nomenclatureof being Model 3, but Model S and X, which is I guess sort of my fault being too quick -- too clever for myown good there, because it was supposed to be the Model E. As you can tell, I have a wonderful sense ofhumor, and -- but then people mistook that for generation 3. But in fact, if you look at, say -- what we'rereally on right now, I would say is approximately generation 4. But we're on generation 4 of S, X and 3 atthe risk of really confusing matters. Model 3 is generation 4 and so -- but so are S and X. We evolve thetechnology all at the same time. So overall looking really good.And then Solar Roof. We have installed and working the Solar Roof tiles. I have it on my house. J.B. hasit on his house. We have -- I think we included some of the pictures in the earnings letter. I want to be --I want to emphasize those are un -- the roof, there's no Photoshop-ing on the roof. That is actually howit looks. And it wasn't taken by some amaze -- it was like take some pics with your phone and send themover. That's what we're talking about here, not some special lighting conditions, pro photographer artsituation. And this is version 1. I think this roof's going to look really knockout as we just keep iterating.Now it is a very challenging technical task to get this right, get the cost good, streamline the installationprocess, ramp up the production. Again, this is sort of -- it follows some of the S-curve to vehicles where itstarts up very slow -- it starts up very slow, but then it grows exponentially.Also, our conventional solar is doing quite well and generating significant positive cash flow, just putstandard flat panel stuff, which I think is solar the right solution for any product to -- for any kind of flatroof situation, which is most commercial installations and a lot of houses or some part of the roof which isreally not visible and, therefore, does not have any aesthetic -- it doesn't really matter from an aestheticstandpoint.And then batteries are also making great, great progress in the battery front. Yes, I'm hoping to dosomething around the International Astronautical Congress, which is in Adelaide this year, but notpromising anything. But we're aspirationally going to have a very substantial portion of the batterypack already done in about 8 weeks, which is hard because this -- we have all the shipping and logisticchallenges of getting things across the Pacific.",

It was a great event. Wanted to ask, if I may, my onequestion on capital expenditures. Wanted to get an idea. What comes next with respect to some of yourspending on the Model 3? And then, I guess, if I can nest one in related to Gigafactory. It's one questionon CapEx but really want to understand what the big next steps are in 3Q and 4Q as we start to kind ofbuild out our models and figure it out from there.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderCertainly. I mean, I do want to emphasize, like, the -- a lot of this is actually very hard for us to know.When we make mistakes, it's because we're stupid not because we're trying to mislead anyone. I justwant to emphasize, I, we, sort of we aspire to be less dumb over time. So if I knew it, I would tell you.It's sort of like I've got this like secret hand of cards that I'm holding close to my vest, and I'm not tellingyou. It's just fundamentally impossible to predict the exponential part of the manufacturing S-curve. It'scrazy hard. And S-curve is a simplification because it's really running through a series of constraints that,if you -- and so it's like a really jagged sort of upward growth, and it'll plateau, and then it'll grow rapidly,and it'll plateau again. And then some sometimes it'll go backwards because something broke. Well, whenI said manufacturing hell on -- and supply chain hell on Friday, I meant it. I mean -- but we know this.Signed up for it, not blaming hell because we bought the ticket. So I -- but I think at a high level, I don'tthink we should expect any significant negative surprises. There will be -- as you look at the case, theretends to be some cost growth in CapEx for unexpected things. We've got to expedite this. You've got to fixthat. Or this supplier doesn't work out. Or this machine we bought doesn't work out. And you've got to beall hands on deck 24/7 to fix it or replace it. But I don't expect any significant -- I think that it's relativelycontained.

I think it's in the completion of the Model 3.We are paying off on the equipment. And also we're just continuing with the construction of Gigafactory tocontinue to scale that, and so that's where majority of our capital...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderOverwhelmingly. Let's be fair. Overwhelmingly is Model 3. Obviously, there are expenditures associatedwith Solar Roof, and with our Buffalo factory, we're trying to keep those relatively light for the next fewmonths.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. And the marketing and sales are growing our infrastructure there and our Supercharging networks, sothose are the other small pieces.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. But just on Buffalo, if I may, I really want to emphasize we expect the Buffalo Gigafactory to be apowerhouse of solar panel and solar glass tile output. It is going to be a kickass facility. We've made thatcommitment to the state of New York. We are going to keep that. commitment. So -- and then we're alsothinking hard about where do we put Gigafactories 3, 4, 5 and 6. We expect to keep the majority of ourproduction in the U.S. and -- but, it's obviously going to make sense to establish a Gigafactory in Chinaand Europe, just to serve the markets there because it's not too -- [indiscernible] in California and truckthem halfway around the world, particularly when you're trying to make things as affordable as possible,that really hurt. We really want to get -- make our cars as affordable as possible, and so that does requiresome amount of local market production, particularly for the mass market vehicles in order to make it asaccessible as possible. So we think hard about that. I think we'll have some announcements on at least afew of those locations before the end of the year. But we don't expect to spend significant money on them.Just it's identifying the location, doing the long lead-time stuff, the permits, the planning. This doesn't costa lot of money.

Yes. So that will really accelerate our ability toget Model Y to market faster for -- because it's fundamentally to -- you have people who prefer a sedan,people who prefer an SUV and, in fact, the SUV market is larger which is the biggest single [ proximity ]I believe in the world. So which I thank my executive team for stopping me from being a fool. And yes.So Model Y, what the hell, will be -- have relatively low technical and production reschedule result.

I think there are some interesting things on the horizon, but then thetime it takes from something working in the lab to working at moderate production levels, to workingat high production levels, to optimizing the cost is several years.

You go from the labto small production, then you go to large production, then you get to cost optimization. These are severalyears, okay. I wish it was shorter, but that's the way it goes. So don't worry about that. And yes, so wasthere...Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThe 25% Model 3 gross margin target. When will we get there?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. So J.B. might want to elaborate on this, but I feel like the point at which we are at steady-state 5,000units a week for Model 3 is about when we've reached the 25% gross margin level. So it wouldn't beright when we get to 5,000 because initially when you get to 5,000 a week, there's still a lot of overtime.You're still expediting parts from all around the world.",

So you guide to positive cash fromoperations the back half, presumably on your Model 3 ramp in 4Q. But if it's only a little positive, thenI guess you would be close to your targeted cash level. So the question is can you help us size of howpositive do you expect the cash from operations to be in the back half? And if that level of cash fromoperations plus whatever remains available to draw on your asset-backed line, if that's sufficient cushionfor you relative to your $1 billion target or whether it might make sense to do another equity raise?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Deepak, do you want to...Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, sure, sure, Ryan. So we expect our operating cash flows to be significantly better in the second halfcompared to the first half. At their highest level, scaling generates cash.Elon R.

MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderClose to 60 days payment terms with our suppliers. The -- and we are also able to make the car a lotfaster. So obviously, the nirvana is that we can make the car and get paid for the car before we have topay our suppliers, which then the faster you grow, the faster your cash position grows. Obviously that'slike the promised land right there. And that's how it's -- what certainly that's how it's -- what we've aimedfor.

Or does it go downbecause of what you just said about the ability to generate cash and working capital while production isramping?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerIn the long run, it will go up as our balance sheet grows. And just to finish off on your question, we alsohave liquidity through the lines of credit, our ABL line is -- we've just grown it to $1.9 billion. We haveuntapped $800 million there. Of course, how much we can tap there depends on our borrowing base butthat's a source of liquidity. And then for our solar leased assets, we have $700 million of funding which isuntapped on our tax equity funds and aggregation debt. So we have significant amounts of liquidity to beable to fund those lines through.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. One side point that's perhaps worth nothing is that as long as people look at our sort of finishedgoods inventory and compare that to other car companies, but they compare it in the wrong way. BecauseTesla does direct distribution, we are the dealers. You really -- to accurately compare Tesla to other carcompanies, you must include the finished goods inventory, not just at the car companies, but at thedealers.

Elon, you're putting a liquid cooled supercomputer in all of yourcars. You're obviously ramping up more and more of those.

I imagine you're in a position to kind ofshare that data with the public or the regulators or Congress, whoever, where it matters.

So I mean how do you -- yes, how doyou frame that and gauge that?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. First of all, actually I should clarify that the number of Superchargers will, in fact, triple betweennow and the end of next year. And that's -- we're confident that, that will address the Superchargingneeds of S, X and 3. So we're trying to stay ahead of it.

StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, maybe just one other point on that and how this can scale pretty efficiently. We have Superchargersthat serve 2 major separate needs. There's long-distance route enabling between cities and then there'salso within the cities. And while there are definitely some congestion issues, which we're expanding outof very quickly in the cities, for the most part, the Superchargers that are in between cities have a lotof extra capacity. And we've put those stations in place to serve travel between the cities, but they canabsorb a lot more cars. So even if we double fleet size, it doesn't mean that we need to double the entireSupercharge network. We have to address the few urban sites that are currently in high use, but that canbe done much more efficiently with less CapEx.",

And is the charge time on the 3 the same as the S?I wasn't sure with some of the release.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIt's about the same. Yes, it's comparable to the high-end S. Like your -- the recharge rate of how manymiles per hour you recharge is sort of your function of the battery pack size. So like a 100-kilowatt hourpack -- because charge rate is as a function of percentage of packs. So think of 3 and the high-end S asbeing similar in charge rates.

I had said that there were 500,000 net reservations. Well, I did alsosay that I wasn't sure because I don't follow this number and that this was just a guess.

These are not prototypes in any way. They're not validation anything. They are fullproduction cars.

Then I guess my follow-up question would just be on your 3Q gross margin guidance of a dip below20%. How far below -- to phrase correctly, how dependent upon production and hitting an S-curve orramping up do you think that below 20% is?

Yes.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionYes, the pace of OpEx through second half, you guided was flat. With the Model 3 going out, are youbasically saying you have the operating infrastructure to handle that, but then does that ramp in 2018?And similarly for CapEx to go from 30 Model 3s up to the exit rate, you're talking $2 billion. How do wethink about, a, that run rate and given how do we tie it to your exponential ramp? And b, what does thatimply for CapEx going into 2018?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, so your first question was operating expenses?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerAnd do we have enough infrastructure in place to service the Model 3. And I think we're finally actuallyleveraging our own infrastructure and that's helping us. So I'll give you an example of that. In service, aswe've talked about, we discovered that 80% of the cars that we repair don't require a lift. And so we'redeploying a mobile service strategy to take 80% of the cars and fix them where it's convenient to thecustomer. Not at our location, at their location. Make it invisible to them.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Exactly. Like the nice thing is like you -- like the ideal service is it's invisible. You don't even noticeit and when it's done, you love it. And so what we're talking about here with the mobile service trucks,as Jon was saying, really most of the time we don't really need a lift, is that your car could be parked,it could be at your office parking lot or at your house. But let's say it's like it's at work. The -- Tesla willcome there, fix your car and by the time you need to leave for work, it's done.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceThat's right. And so what that does for us is it takes 80% of the volume out of our existing footprint. Andallows us to leverage that footprint to grow with Model 3. And we'd give you similar examples in stores. Sothat's why we've guided to the OpEx that we've guided for the second half. We feel like we've got leveragethere and we've got plans in place to further lever that in 2018.Elon R.",
