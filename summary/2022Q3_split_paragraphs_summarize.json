        "original_text": "I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhornand a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time inthe update that we published at the same link as this webcast.During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ﬁlings with the SEC. During the Q&A session portion of today's call, please limit yourself to1 question and 1 follow-up. (Operator Instructions) But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has someopening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you, Martin. So just to do a Q3 recap. Q3 was another record quarter on many levels. We hadour industry-leading operating margin reached 17%. And our free cash ﬂow surpassed $3 billion inQ3 and approached $9 billion in the past 12 months. As our factories ramp, we're looking forwardto a record-breaking Q4. So it really, knock on wood, it looks like we'll have an epic end of year. SoQ4 is looking extremely good.On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week withvery good quality and is ramping rapidly. Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestonevery soon. And in fact just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday's hold rate, it would be 2,000.Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter. We are ﬁnallygaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell. And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to startincorporating in cars and having it be a signiﬁcant portion of our production here in Texas in thecoming months. We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells inTexas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3. And we intend to keepraising production in Fremont.Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and showed the ﬁrstprototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range ofimprovements of full self-driving software.Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving beta mode, and this numbercontinues to grow exponentially. Our goal with that AI Day was recruiting, and we've seen amassive inﬂux of world-class artiﬁcial intelligence engineer and scientist resume.",

        "original_text": "So it generated atremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world. I can't emphasizethe importance of this enough because I think it ﬁnally has become clear to the smallest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.So this quarter, we expect to go to wide release of full self-driving beta in North America. Soanyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving will have access to the FSD Betaprogram this year, probably about a month from now. So and then, obviously, any new -- anyonewho buys a car and purchase a full self-driving option will immediately have that available to them.So the safety that we're seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually signiﬁcantly greater than thesafety we're seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.Let's see, with respect to demand. We've got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks. I can'temphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we makefor as far into the future as we can see. So the factories are running at full speed, and we'redelivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong. We are still a very smallpercentage of the total vehicles on the road. Of the 2 billion trucks on the road, we only have about3.5 million. So we're about a long way to go to even reach 1% of the global ﬂeet.Let's see. Based on my -- what people -- based on many things, but certainly questions I get onTwitter about buybacks. And I think every one of our Board members has gotten questions aboutbuybacks. The -- we've debated the buyback idea extensively at the Board level. The Boardgenerally thinks that it makes sense to do a buyback. But we want to work through the right processto do a buyback, but it's certainly possible for us to do a buyback on the order of $5 billion to $10billion. Even in the downside scenario next year, even given if next year is a very difﬁcult year, westill have the ability to do a $5 billion to $10 billion buyback. This is obviously pending Boardreview and approval. So it's likely that we'll do some meaningful buyback.So in conclusion, while the market theme revolve around the short term, it's very important to focuson the long term.",

        "original_text": "I can't emphasize this enough with investors. And I think long-time investors,obviously recognize this with Tesla. We have our sort of local ups and downs, but long-term trendhas been extremely good. And several years ago I said, I think on our earnings call, that I thought itwas possible for Tesla to be worth more than Apple, which was then the highest market capcompany, I think, in the market. And Apple, at that time, I think was around $700 billion. And Isaid it required incredible execution and at least some luck.And we didn't only achieve that. Tesla went, in fact, or passed Apple's market cap at the time. Andnow I am of the opinion that we can far exceed Apple's current market cap. In fact, I see a potentialpath with Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. So now that doesn'tmean it will happen or that will be easy. In fact, I think it will be very difﬁcult. It will require a lotof work, some very creative new products, managed expansion and, always, luck.But for the ﬁrst time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let's say, roughly twice the valueof Saudi Aramco. I think that's -- I haven't quite seen that yet. I mean this is the ﬁrst time I've seenthat potential.So we have an incredible product portfolio. I think we've got the most exciting product portfolio ofany company on earth, some of which you've heard about, some of which you haven't. We're in theﬁnal lap for Cybertruck. We're building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas Austin and making alot of progress in the robotaxi platform design.And then with respect to batteries, we're moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve 1,000gigawatt hours a year of production capacity in the United States, vertically integrated. And ourcathode reﬁning, we're moving a ton of speed to do that.So I think it's an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future. But none of thiswould be possible without the incredible team that we have here at Tesla. So I'd like to give a hugeshout-out to all of our factory employees, engineers, executives and the whole Tesla team. You guysrock. You're the ones making it happen. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.",

Just to continue on Elon's theme, I just want to thank and congratulate theTesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the thirdquarter.On automotive proﬁtability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2%, with automotive gross marginat 27.9%. Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it toQ1.Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been ourstrongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%. Note that while small andgrowing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to proﬁtability.We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, aswe've discussed at length on prior calls. In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchangewas a big part of this past quarter.On energy proﬁtability, we achieved our strongest gross proﬁt yet for this business, driven primarilyby record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products. Our free cash ﬂows were also arecord despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact onworking capital.Speciﬁcally on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2, we've started toexperience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn't anticipate. This issue isparticularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of theU.S. and Europe. Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads toextreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the ﬁnal weeks of each quarter. Just to putthis in perspective, roughly 2/3 of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and 1/3 in the ﬁnal 2weeks. As a result, we have begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduceour peak needs for outbound logistics. We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs andimprove the experience of our customers.As we look ahead, our plans show that we're on track for the 50% annual growth in production thisyear, although we are tracking supply chain risks, which are beyond our control. On the deliveryside, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end ofthe year, as noted, just above. This means that, again, you should expect a gap between productionand deliveries in Q4, and those cars in transit will be delivered shortly to their customers uponarrival to their destination in Q1.Boston and Berlin ramp costs will continue to weigh on margins, although we expect the impact tobe less than what we saw in Q3.",

Total output is up 3x quarter-over-quarter, and production istracking to exceed 1,000 car cells per week this quarter, as we said last quarter. Our focus is nowshifting from 100% ramp to cost and further expanding production capacity in North America, asElon also mentioned.On the 2170 versus 4680, in our factories, we really attempt to minimize factory complexity andproduct changeover while still making sure we get enough new product into the ﬁeld to learn how itis performing. And that sort of mix is going to shift as 4680 scales here and the overall factory rampproceeds in Texas.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorRight.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. So I think the public, at large, realizes that the world is moving towards electricvehicles. And that it's foolish to actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residualvalue of that gasoline car is going to be very low. So I think we are in a very good spot. But Iwouldn't say it's recession-proof. But it's certainly recession-resilient because, basically, it has --people both have large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars.And then in transitioning electricity generation to sustainable, you need solar and wind with thestationary battery pack to buffer the power.

Just to echo Elon's point, I mean, I think where our cashbalance is, what our forecasted cash generation is, where our margins are as a company, I mean wecan withstand quite a lot of downside before we would have to dig into our capital plans,Supercharger expansion, product lineup.So the business has done quite well over the last handful of quarters.

We don't particularly integrate just for the hell of particularly integrating.

But if we have to go mine, we will mine.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDElon, my follow-up is 1 terawatt hour of manufacturing in the United States, vertically integrated. Iguess my question is what would need to change with U.S. permitting laws to allow that? Kind ofwhat would be your message to this administration or next?

And the suggestion that we have is that there should be an expeditedpermitting process for anything which is critical to a sustainable energy future.So it doesn't make sense to put like a coal mine and a sustainable energy battery like lithium mine inthe same category. Coal is not in the future, lithium does. And by the way, you can extract lithiumwith almost no disturbance to the local environment.

So last time we talked about it, there were --it was a question about like scaling out manufacturing and there were still a few things to get right.Is it fair to say that now you are at scale, and it's just a question of logistics to get bigger? So that'squestion number one.And then question number two, on the kind of like innovation and cost reduction and efﬁciencyimprovements kind of path that you described at the battery day, where are we today? And howmuch time is it going to take to deliver all the potential you outlined then?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringWell, I'll take the second question ﬁrst. At Battery Day, we showed a time line out to 2026 for all ofthe ideas we had proposed and had shared with everybody then.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorAnd yes, I'd be surprised. I think we'll do better than that.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. I mean but that's the rough -- just give you all -- it's on that order. It's not like a month. It's not6 months. It's years. And we are executing on all of those different ideas pretty aggressively inparallel with the OpEx that some people think isn't enough, but we're getting it done.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI mean I'm not turning down POs.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, yes, or great talents, like we ﬁnd someone [awesome], we bring them into the company. Andpeople shouldn't believe we are turning people away.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean it's a hot pond but we're solving it. And I think -- we still feel conﬁdent that 4680 willbe the most competitive battery cell in the world.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd it's the whole system around it, right? It's not necessarily a speciﬁc form factor. It's theattention to detail on how to bring costs out of the manufacturing process or remove processingsteps.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorAnd all the way down from the mine to the cell.Andrew D.",

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. And for those who watched the YouTube videos, like, our on-site cathode facilities comingtogether, I'm really excited about that, which is a part of the plan that we discussed on Battery Day.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe're -- possibly building lithium reﬁnery.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringIn Corpus Christi. So we're making -- putting our money where our mouths are and all the variousefforts that we discussed on Battery Day.On the technical challenges and the ramp question, which is your ﬁrst question on 4680, no ramp isever easy even at the end when you're 80% to the end, like it's still very challenging to get to theend. And that sort of leaning out of yields, the ﬁnal cycle time to achieve target. You mentionedlogistics, it's not something that we're speciﬁcally focused on, I guess, but eventually could be aproblem as we're talking about hundreds of gigawatt hours at different sites across the UnitedStates.But I would never sit here and say we have no challenges remaining. But we've made a lot ofprogress reducing technical risk in many areas. Cycle times have dramatically improved. Yield hasdramatically improved. And just walking the line here in Texas, like Martin was walking ityesterday, made some comments to me. You really see the acceleration around you. And we'vemade a ton of simpliﬁcations moving from the Fremont factory to Texas, and it's coming to play inspeed of ramp here. And of course, that's on one line of many here in Texas. So it's not like factory-to-factory. It's a multiplication of both simplicity and scale. So yes, we're excited about where it'sheaded.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. And I think, once we are fully integrated, I think we still do see a path to hold roughly $70kilowatt hour cell -- $70 per kilowatt hour cell before any incentive.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringBefore incentives.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorBefore incentive. Yes.",

        "original_text": "Thank you. And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystYes. I just wanted to follow up on the 4680 cells and where we are seeing them deployed today. Soare those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1? Are we seeing them in Model Ysthat are being produced out of Austin? And is -- do you anticipate 4680 being a gating factor forCybertruck ramp later this year? And how do you balance the need for 4680 across Semi,Cybertruck and, potentially, Model Y in 2023? And I have a follow-up, please.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWow. Okay. The Semi doesn't use 4680s. Yes. We are making Model Ys. Some of the Model Yscoming out of Giga Texas are 4680. And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is 4680 Model Y?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. 10,000 miles.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & Director10,000 miles. Yes, it's pretty good.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringNo problems yet. Yes.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorStructural pack?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringStructural pack, yes.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSo -- and yes, I mean, and our output at 4680 is growing exponentially, so. But it's worth bearing inmind like there are entire highly competitive companies that are very smart that all they do is makebattery cells. This is simply 1 segment of Tesla. So it's not a total working block.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringNo, there aren't -- there are challenges still ahead that we have not yet surpassed. No doubt.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe don't anticipate this being anything limiting factor for Cybertruck or anything else.",

        "original_text": "Okay. And the last question comes from William Stein from Truist.William Stein - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MDI guess I'll go at one that I asked last time, Elon, which is your expectation for the likelihood ofcommercial success in each of the 3 major AI endeavors, FSD sort of as imagined without a driver,the training computer and, of course, Optimus.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe'll achieve full self-driving full time probability of that occurring is 100%. And I think we'll --we're almost there. And then, of course, we've got to prove it to regulators and get the regulatoryapprovals, which is outside of our control. But anyone who's driving full self-driving cars, has thefull self-driving Beta in the car, can see the rate of improvement.You can just experience for yourself that we are, in fact, getting there. In fact, we almost are there.And so we're probably achieving that 100%.The Optimus, probably of that being a successful product, I think, also extremely high, givenenough time, 100%.Dojo, just maybe more of a question around Dojo, like can we be competitive with NVIDIA GPUseven as somebody continues to rapidly evolve their GPUs? So as I said, the jury is out on Dojo.There's a team's taken -- outperformed NVIDIA for neural training. If the jury's out, we willprobably -- I don't know, next year, if that's true or not. But we think we're probably -- we think it's -- this is -- the architecture of Dojo has the right architecture to win. Yes. It depends on how well weexecute in that architecture.",
