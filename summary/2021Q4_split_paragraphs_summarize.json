Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m.Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ﬁlings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. So just to recap 2021, it was a breakthrough year for Tesla and for electric vehiclesin general. And while we battled, and everyone did, with supply chain challenges through the year,we managed to grow our volumes by nearly 90% last year. This level of growth didn't happen bycoincidence. It was a result of ingenuity and hard work across multiple teams throughout thecompany.Additionally, we reached the highest operating margin in the industry in the last widely reportedquarter at over 14% GAAP operating margin. Lastly, thanks to $5.5 billion of GAAP net income in2021, our accumulated proﬁtability since the inception of the company became positive, which Ithink makes us a real company at this point. This is a critical milestone for the company.So after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin. So we've begunproduction at both Texas and Berlin. We started that last quarter. But that's not the most importantthing. We focus more on when do we get to volume production and when can we deliver cars tocustomers. But I think it is worth noting that, and as the Internet has observed, we've been makingquite a few cars in Austin and Berlin.So in Texas, we're building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the 4680 cells, and wewill start delivering after ﬁnal certiﬁcation of vehicle, which should be fairly soon. Capacityexpansion will continue through maximizing output of each factory and building new factories innew locations in the future. Although we're not ready to announce any new locations on this call,but we will, through 2022, look at new locations and probably be able to announce new locationstowards the end of this year, I expect.In 2022, supply chain will continue to be the fundamental limiter of output across all factories.",

And last year was difﬁcult to predict and hopefully, this year will be smooth-sailing, but I'm not sure what you do for an encore to 2021, 2020. Nonetheless, we do expect signiﬁcant growth in 2022 over 2021, comfortably above 50% growth in 2022.Full Self-Driving. So over time, we think Full Self-Driving will become the most important sourceof proﬁtability for Tesla. I mean actually, if you run the numbers on robotaxis, it's kind of nutty. It'snutty good from a ﬁnancial standpoint. And I think we're completely conﬁdent at this point that itwill be achieved. And my personal guess is that we'll achieve Full Self-Driving this year, yes, withdata safety level signiﬁcantly greater than at present. So the cars in the ﬂeet essentially becomingself-driving via a software update, I think, might end up being the biggest increase in asset value ofany asset class in history. We shall see. It would also have a profound impact on improving safetyand on accelerating the world towards sustainable energy through vastly better asset utilization.Let's see, so on the product road map front, there's quite a lot to talk about. I'm not going to gothrough every sort of thing that we're working on because I think a lot of them deserve productlaunches of their own as opposed to a few minutes on an earnings call. So I'll talk kind of mostly ata high level.The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output. So both last year and this year, if wewere to introduce new vehicles, our total vehicle output would decrease. This is a very importantpoint that I think a lot of people do not understand. So last year, we spent a lot of engineering andmanagement resources solving supply chain issues: rewriting code, changing our chips, reducingthe number of chips we need, with chip drama central. And that was not the only supply chainissue. So there's just hundreds of things. And as a result, we were able to grow almost 90% while atleast almost every other manufacturer contracted last year. So that's a good result.But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, our total vehicle output would have been thesame because of the chips constraints, particularly. So if we'd actually introduced an additionalproduct, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on that increased complexity ofthe additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.",

We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling andwhatnot to create those vehicles: Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring thoseto production hopefully next year. That is most likely. But like I said, it is dependent on are we ableto produce more cars or fewer cars.So in terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we'redoing this year is actually the Optimus humanoid robot. This, I think, has the potential to be moresigniﬁcant than the vehicle business over time. If you think about the economy, the foundation ofthe economy is labor. Capital equipment is distilled labor. So what happens if you don't actuallyhave a labor shortage? I'm not sure what an economy even means at that point. That's what Optimusis about. So very important.Drew, do you want me to talk about the 4680 program? Or is this good, the right time?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Sure. So throughout 2021, we focused on growing cell supply alongside our in-house 4680effort to provide us ﬂexibility and insurance as we attempt to grow as fast as possible. As we sittoday, sales from suppliers actually sort of exceeds our other factory-limiting constraints that youmentioned, Elon, in 2022. Or to say differently, 4680 cells are not a constraint to our 2022 volumeplans based on the information we have.But we are making meaningful progress up the ramp curve in Kato. We're building 4680 structuralpacks every day, which are being assembled into vehicles in Texas. I was driving one yesterday andthe day before. And we believe our ﬁrst 4680 vehicles will be delivered this quarter. Our focus onthe cell, the pack and the vehicles here is driving yield quality and cost to ensure we're ready forlarger volumes this year as we ramp and next year. And the 4680 and pack tool installations here atGiga Austin are progressing well with some areas producing ﬁrst parts. And the Internet has alsonoticed that. Yes, I was touring the cell factory here. I'm super pumped. It's like a really excitingaccomplishment for us to bring everything into one awesome factory here in Texas.Elon R.

Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. As Elon mentioned, 2021 was a ﬁnancially transformative year for thecompany. If we look across the full year '21 and compare that to 2020, our automotive grossmargin, excluding credits, rose by over 600 basis points enabled by work on cost reduction,utilization of our Shanghai factory for exports and accelerating demand.OpEx as a percentage of revenue reduced despite the impact of onetime items and unique items.And operating income more than tripled, with operating margin reaching our guidance of mid-teens.And these margins are trending up. We also saw regulatory credits accounting for a relatively smallportion of our 2021 proﬁtability, which we expect to continue to reduce in materiality goingforward.For Q4 speciﬁcally, automotive gross margin, excluding credits, increased to 29.2%, which is ourhighest yet. We do continue to see some impact of higher pricing on certain models and trends aswas the case in prior quarters. But please keep in mind that due to backlogs, changes in pricing willgenerally impact our ﬁnancials in future quarters. Supply chain challenges and port congestionresulted in a signiﬁcant increase in our expedited costs in Q4. We also took reserves associated withwarranty and recall costs.Operating expenses were meaningfully impacted by stock-based compensation from the ﬁnal 2tranches of the CEO stock grant becoming probable and payroll taxes associated with the exerciseof the 2012 CEO options. The total impact of these payroll taxes, warranty and recall costs andexcess expedites was just over $700 million in the quarter.Our free cash ﬂows have remained strong, reaching record levels in Q4 of $2.8 billion despiteincreased CapEx. In addition to using cash to grow the business as quickly as we can, we have beenretiring legacy and high interest debt. Note that we plan to continue to utilize the ABS market forproduct-speciﬁc ﬁnancing.As we look forward, we expect 2022 to be another signiﬁcant and exciting year for the company.We continue to drive for vehicle volume growth at or above 50%, as Elon mentioned, and our plansshow that this is actually achievable with just our Fremont and Shanghai factories. For quite sometime now, these factories have been running below capacity due to macro challenges with supplyand logistics. As Elon mentioned as well, from what we're seeing, the pace of growth in 2022 willagain be determined by supply chain and logistics, which is quite difﬁcult for us to forecast.Despite these constraints, it's important to begin the ramp of Austin and Berlin to ensure that we areprepared once limitations ease, enabling us to increase total output more quickly in the future.",

I think thethreshold that really matters is, at which point, when does it become more competitive than a GPUcluster for training. And obviously, the GPU cluster is getting better. So it's a moving target. Butthat's the goal I've set for the team. The FSD team running our GPU supercluster needs to tell methat they want to use Dojo instead. That's the obvious sort of threshold. And I don't know when thatwill be.I wouldn't say like success is 100% certain here. I think we just generally want to overestimatemeeting options and underestimate ourselves. But it does seem as though we might pass thatthreshold next year with Dojo if we execute well. Dojo is not needed for full self-driving but it is acost optimization on creating vast amounts of video data. Cost optimization is also a rate ofimprovement. So if you can train models faster, have a shorter iteration interval, then you can makeprogress faster. So not everything can be distributed to something like GPUs. There's someelements of serialization there.And then if Dojo is competitive, then it does seem like the kind of thing where we would offer it toother companies that want to do neural net training. Those are very much a neural net trainingoptimized system. But in theory, it should be better than a generalized computing platform or, say,GPUs, which are not really intended for -- the pixel trader is not directly intended for optimizingtraining of neural networks. They just happen to work better than CPUs in most cases. So weshould be thinking of like Dojo as like a giant ASIC optimized for neural net training, especiallyvideo [or video-like] things.

Next question is, what is your expected max capacity from each of your currentfactories: Fremont, Shanghai, Berlin and Austin and timing for new factory announcements?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI don't think we want to comment on -- it's always possible to increase the output of any givenfactory. So to say what's the next capacity, well, it's difﬁcult to say what that next capacity isbecause you put a lot of evidence that you increase capacity quite a lot. Look at the big picture.Initially, we always want to increase capacity at one factory because logistics cost of transportingcars needs to be considered. Especially, as the cars become more affordable, you want to havefactories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers. So even if you couldincrease output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.So in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas coming up, we would want to deliver, say, ModelYs that are going to the eastern 2/3 of the United States from this factory because the logistics costsare going to be much less. But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and at Giga Nevadaand at Shanghai. And as I said at the beginning of the call, 2022 is the year we will be looking atfactory locations to see what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the endof this year, yes.",

The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one,economies of scale; number two, production line design efﬁciencies; number three, reducedtransportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inﬂation; ornumber ﬁve, other sources? And how much further could margins improve and why?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. There's basically 4 major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvementwithin the company. And they're in no particular order here, but these are the big ones. So our mixof Model Y is increasing as we've ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher proﬁt than the Model 3.And so that is helpful on our margins. And then as we increase the volume on that program withlabor efﬁciencies, ﬁxed cost amortization, they improve and the costs go down as well.The second 1 here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the company.And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it. That factory had a differentline design, more efﬁcient from the start, and we've been pushing the boundaries on the volumethere. So that has been helpful. If you recall, at the beginning of the year, we also were in atransition to the new version of the Model S and Model X. And so as that has ramped over thecourse of the year, that has been helpful. And then we've also done various price increases in certainmarkets on certain models, which has helped there. So that's generally the story at a high level.As we look over the next quarter or 2, as I mentioned in my opening remarks and the last call aswell, we have ramp inefﬁciencies from the launch of Austin and Berlin. We also have pressurescoming from inﬂation, supply chain, raw materials, et cetera. And so where that nets out is hard tosay in the immediate term. And we obviously, as a company, are going to be driving to increasemargins as much as we can. But I just want to be realistic that we're launching 2 factoriessimultaneously here and it unavoidably will add cost to the business as we do that.And as we look further out, and Elon mentioned this in his opening remarks as well, the softwareportion of the business, I think, is the one to really pay attention to.",

And the ﬁrst question comes from Jed fromCanaccord.Jonathan Edward Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD & AnalystCongratulations on a great year. Elon, I guess my question is around the Megapack or your energybusiness. And so as we look at the strategy or the supply chain constraints that you mentioned, youhave 2 different strategies, or it seems like, with Megapack and Powerwall. And I think thePowerwall was answered with 4680 and the 2170 opening up. So I was wondering if you could justtalk about the supply chain and LFP for the Megapack and what we should expect for that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. To be clear, we do think that old stationary storage, Powerwall and Megapack, will transitionto an iron-based system, basically a non-nickel system. Manganese also could be part of the future,but primarily iron. It just comes up, iron-nickel. We need something that is formed in a star before asupernova ideally. So iron is. So there's a ridiculous amount of iron on Earth as is a ridiculousamount of lithium. So you can really expect all stationary storage to transition to iron over time.And manganese is like a wildcard. There's also less manganese. Anyway, I should say like we didshort-change the energy business last year in that vehicle took priority over the energy side not oncells but on chips. So yes, we do see a very long-term probably terawatt-hour per year energybusiness. So a lot, it's pretty vast. Yes.Jonathan Edward Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD & AnalystThat's helpful. So you see that '22 is kind of the opening of the energy business reaccelerating.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIt's hard to predict 2022 because there are still lingering supply chain issues globally. But I think thechip stuff, at least the chip side of things, appears to looks like it will alleviate end of this year or'23. I mean there's a crazy number of chip fabs being built, which is great.

First, you spoke a lot about FSD and how the economics could be very attractivegoing forward. I'm wondering if you could just share what your current attach rate might be forFSD on your vehicles or how to think about the progress of your attach rate or revenue in FSD, let'ssay, in '21 versus '20 and how much deferred revenue for FSD was drawn down during the year.And I have a follow-up, please.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think the FSD stuff, you really don't want to be looking at the rearview mirror. It will not be agood indicator for the future. What you need is to look out at the front windscreen because it is sucha profound step change. I mean effectively, long term, every car will have FSD. And the value ofthat will be a very big number. Just look at this as asset utilization, you have a passenger car, whichnormally is driven maybe 1.5 hours a day on average, maybe 10, 12 hours a week, a lot of cars inthe parking lots, so you're spending money not just driving the cars but storing them all over theplace. We can get rid of a lot of parking lots if you have a car that is operating all the time.But there will be a challenge with trafﬁc. So we have like this little tiny baby company, The BoringCompany, which I initially started as a joke. And now I think it actually could be quite essential toalleviating the insane trafﬁc that will happen when cars are autonomous because you reduce thepain of travel and you reduce the cost of travel so dramatically that there will be a crazy number ofcars on the road. I mean I think it will be cheaper to go point to point with a robotaxi, which is anautonomous Tesla, which every car we've made in the past 3 or 4 years will be capable of that, thana bus or a subway. It will cost less than the subsidized value of a bus ticket. So if you want to get --cool, I'm not going to take the bus.If it costs you, I don't know, for argument's sake, $2 to travel 10 miles point to point, nobody istaking the bus, especially in cold weather or it's dark or maybe a little bit dangerous, to hell withthat.",

I mean it's apparent from the questions that the gravity of full self-driving is not fullyappreciated. If an asset has 5x more utilization, in fact, it's like dividing the cost of that asset by 5.So if you have a $50,000 car, it's like having a $10,000 car all of a sudden. But maybe better thanthat, because still you may want to drive, so the person can be engaged in productivity oramusement instead of having to onerously drive through trafﬁc.

On the 4680 as a form factor, yes, we've engaged with a number of our partners, our suppliers,on the form factor. And they're all working on it. And they look at it the way we look at it as a wayto drive fundamental cost efﬁciencies in production and also, ultimately, the design of the cell itselfto drive the cost down of the cell. I mean we're engaged because we think it's a good form factor.They're engaged because they think it's a good form factor. And we want people to make it for sure.To the question about should everything be 4680, it doesn't have to be. In the end, it's about costcompetitiveness, scalability of manufacturing. And when you compare like an iron cell with anickel cell, for example, like there are some just physics-based differences in what happens incertain corner cases that would drive different form factors, and we just have to be cognizant of thatand design to that.

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAlso just reference oscillators, those are very boring things.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. Like that little chip that allows you to move your seat back and forth, that actually wasa big problem. But a lot of these things are alleviating. I think there's some degree of the toilet paperproblem as well where there was a toilet paper shortage during COVID. Obviously, it wasn't reallycertainly a tremendous enhanced need for ass wiping. It's just people panicked and got every paperproduct you could possibly wipe your ass with basically. And I wasn't sure, is this like a real thingor not? I actually took my kids to the H-E-B and Walmart in Texas to just conﬁrm if it was real.Indeed, it was. And there's plenty of food and everything else but just nothing, no paper products.That didn't cause us [plenty].An odd choice for people to panic about, yes, because these things are -- actually, if end of theworld is coming, I think toilet paper is the least of your problems. So I think we saw just a lot ofcompanies over-order chips and then buffer the chips.",

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOkay. And I have a quick follow-up on chips. So you've talked a lot about all this shortage and thesupply difﬁculties. And should we expect like Tesla to take onboard additional suppliers in the near term, especially onthe power side?

What arethe most problematic items in an entire car? There seems like at least 10,000 unique parts in the car,way more than that if you go further up the supply chain. And so which one is going to be the leastlucky one this time? It's hard to say.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. I mean on a go-forward basis, right, the idea is to continue to drive simpliﬁcation. So there arefewer unique parts, fewer of them. On the power side, in particular, it's still like an area oftechnological development where the next chip can do the same thing with less [diarrhea]. So likethe total fab required to accomplish the function goes down. So there's still room to grow withoutneeding more fab capacity. But in general, there's a lot more fab capacity coming. So that's like awin-win there.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. It's not a long-term thing because there's a crazy amount of chip fabs being built, which isgreat.",
