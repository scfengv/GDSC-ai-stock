As a reminder, thisconference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, VP of Investor Relations,Mr. Jeff Evanson. Sir, you may begin.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsThank you, Latif, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's third quarter 2017 Q&A webcast. I'mjoined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and Jon McNeill.Our third quarter results were previously announced in the update letter we published at the same link asthis webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recentfilings with the SEC.Before we jump in to the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSo, pardon me for 1 minute. I have a bit of a cold. So let's see. Actually, we're doing this call from theGigafactory because that's where the production constraint is for Model 3, from the most important thingfor the company. And I always move my desk to wherever -- well, it's not like we have a desk, actually. Imove myself to wherever the biggest problem is in Tesla. Somewhat, I really believe that one should leadfrom the front lines, and that's why I'm here, and I'll go into some of the Gigafactory issues later in thecall, but I'd like to start off by acknowledging some, I think, pretty amazing milestones for Tesla.One thing that I thought was really profound was that we surpassed cumulative deliveries of vehicles. Wesurpassed 0.25 million cumulative deliveries since the company's inception and had record Model S and Xnet orders and deliveries last quarter. So things are really, I think, going quite well.To put that into perspective, 5 years ago, we had only delivered 2,500 cars. So our -- the Tesla fleethas grown by a factor of 100 in 5 years. I would expect, 5 years from now, to be at least an order ofmagnitude, we're beyond where we are right now and possibly even closer towards magnitude.But for the skeptics out there, I'd like to say -- ask them, which one of you predicted that Tesla would gofrom 2,500 units delivered to 250,000 units delivered now? I suspect the answer is 0, right? So consideryour assumptions for the future on whether they're valid or perhaps pessimistic.So for Model 3, we continue to make significant progress each week.",

        "original_text": "We see no primary problems withour supply chain or any of our production processes. Obviously, there are bottlenecks, there are thousandsof processes in creating the Model 3, and we will move as fast as the slowest and least likely processamong those thousands. In fact, there's 10,000 unique parts. Or I could just say, of the tens of thousandsof processes necessary to produce the car, we will move as fast as the least competent and least likelyelements of that mixture.So while the vast majority are going incredibly well, there are some problem areas, and after I give thebusiness overview, I'll do a deep dive into the biggest problem area.So based on where we -- what we know now, as we've gotten really into the details of some of the worstbottlenecks, we expect to achieve approximately 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by late Q1 2018, soprobably sometime in March. This -- I think, in the vast scheme of things, this is a relatively small shift.The Model 3 is a 10-year program, and so we're talking about a few months out of a 10-year programthat's, in the grand scheme of things, as certainly if one is doing net present value calculations, this isimmaterial.The -- and we have a clear path to that. We understand the bottlenecks. It's difficult to fully understandthese things as we actually try to do them. And it's worth noting that some of our manufacturing areas,we're actually seeing capabilities that are, we estimate, in the 6,000 to 7,000 unit per week capability, wellin excess of the 5,000-unit capability. So -- and we're optimistic with further optimization that many of ourproduction processes will need fairly little, and in some cases, no -- so I'm not saying no, but almost noCapEx to reach something close to 10,000 units per week. It's the amount or how much can be done byjust beating up robots, shortening the path, intensifying factory, adding additional robots for choke pointsand just making lines go really, really fast. Speed is the ultimate weapon. And our -- the design of TeslaModel 3 being that it was designed for manufacturability is turning up to be accurate. It's far easier tobuild this car than a Model E -- than a Model S and vastly easier than a Model X.The primary production constraints really by far is in battery module assembly. So this is -- so I'll justdo a little bit of a deep dive on that.",

        "original_text": "There are 4 zones to module manufacturing. So it goes through 4major production zones. The zones 3 and 4 are in good shape; zones 1 and 2 are not. Zone 2 in particular,this is -- we had a subcontractor -- a systems integration subcontractor that unfortunately really droppedthe ball, and we did not realize the degree to which the ball was dropped until quite recently, and we hadto -- this is a very complex manufacturing area. We had to rewrite all of the software from scratch andredo many of the mechanical and electrical elements of zone 2 of module production. We've managedto rewrite what was about 20 to 30 man years of software in 4 weeks, but there's still a long way togo. It's -- because the software work can be fast with the electromechanical elements that need to befabricated and installed, and that -- getting these items in place and rebuilt is, unfortunately, a lot longer,and that's -- it's probably more external constraints than software. This is what I spent many a late nighton the Gigafactory working on. J.B. has been here constantly, and we've -- we allocated many of our bestengineers to fundamentally fixing zone 2 of the module line and then most problem behind that it is zone1.On the plus side, we now have a very detailed understanding of what is necessary to fix zone 1 and zone2. We also have a new design for zone 1 and 2 that is about 3x more effective than the current design. Sowhen we put in -- and there are 3 lines of module production. Lines 1, 2 and 3 are essentially identical.Line 4, which will have the new design, will be at triple the effectiveness of -- will be as good as the other3 lines combined. So we're very confident about the future path of having incredibly efficient production ofmodules and that this will not be a constraint in the future, but unfortunately, it just takes some amount oftime. This is like moving like lightning compared to the -- while there's no one in the automotive industry,there's still some finer amount of time necessary to fix something that we thought was in good shape.We were told by our supplier it was in good shape, but it was really not.

And like I said, I am personally on that line in that machine, trying to solve problemspersonally where I can. And J.B.'s basically spending his life at the Gigafactory. So that's the sort of deepdive on that front.The other thing I want to mention is that there are a lot of articles about Tesla firing employees and layingoff some lines and stuff. These are really ridiculous. And like anyone -- any journalist who'd written articlesin this effect should be ashamed of themselves for lacking journalistic integrity. At every company in theworld, there's annual performance reviews. In our annual performance review, despite Tesla having anextremely high standard, and a standard far higher than other car companies, which we need to have inorder to survive against much larger car companies, you can't be a little guy and have equal levels of skillas the big guy. If you have 2 boxes of equal votes and one's much smaller, the big guy's going to crushthe little guy, obviously. So little guy better have a heck of a lot more skill. And that is why both are justgoing to get hovered. So that is why our standards are high. They're not high because we believe in beingmean to people. They're high because if they're not high, we will die.Despite that, in our annual performance reviews, only 2% of people didn't make the grade. So that'sabout 700 people out of 33,000. This is a pretty low percentage. GE, I don't know if they still do, butthey certainly have for a long time had a policy of firing 10% of their employees poor performers everyyear, no matter what. If you were to stack Tesla's performance, late releases compared to industry --other companies, the number would be low. So the only reason these articles had any play whatsoeveris because journalists and editors with low integrity, they'll provide any context for where they stood.Because the actual article would've read, \"Tesla fires 2% of its employee base for performance-basedreasons. They're remarkably lower number compared to other companies.\" But of course, that will be ameaningless article, so they forget to include that. Shame.And then also, it was not reported that several thousand employees were promoted, and almost half ofthose promotions were in manufacturing.Right. I think let's go to questions.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsOkay, Latif, let's go to that question queue, please.",

Wanted to ask with respect to -- and Elon, thank you for doing the deeper dive into the zones andthe bottlenecks. How does this change the trajectory -- or does it change the trajectory from a marginperspective on the Model 3? And then maybe as an aside, can you tell us where you are today on aproduction-per-week basis and where you expect to be by the end of 2017, just so we can get an idea ofthe ramp?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI don't really like the week-by-week stuff. But the thing -- the reason it's tricky is because people justread too much into it. The ramp curve is a step exponential. So it means like as you alleviate a constraint,the production jumps -- suddenly jumps at a much higher number. And then so although it looks a littlestaggered, if you sort of zoom out, that production ramp is an exponential with giant week-over-weekincreases. I'd like to state a number at the end of Q4, but there's too much uncertainty right now to givethat with any precision. Now I do feel confident about the end of Q1, maybe sooner, but really, it's like --we're like in a vertical climb here. So it's really hard to say it. Yes.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd also to your earlier point -- Deepak here. It does not change any of our projections in terms of thelong-term target gross margin. These are all short-term issues.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight. I mean, it's -- just let me state, by the end of the year, it will be in the thousands. It's well at theend. Yes. Yes.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCI'm sorry, well into the thousands per week or by...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIn the thousands by the end of the year. But where exactly, it's hard to say. And this way, if you movethe calendar by like 2 or 3 weeks, you will see giant changes. So it's like the quarter-to-date will fallsomewhat sort of arbitrarily in that exponential curve. So even a matter of a few weeks would show a verydifferent number. As far as like people tend to extrapolate on a linear basis instead of an exponential. Firstof all, you all know what an exponential is. So if your intuition is -- tends to be a straight-line extrapolationbut really on a very steep exponential.",

Could you just give us a sense, though, about the difference of manufacturing the volume ofthe 3 compared to -- you -- basically 10x the volume that you're trying to get to in the near term? Then Ihave a follow-up.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. There's vastly more automation with Model 3. Now the tricky thing is that when one front of this -- ofthat automation doesn't work, it's way harder to make up for it with manual labor. So with S or X, becausea lot less of it was automated, you -- we could scale up labor hours and achieve a high level of production.With Model 3, it's like -- tends to be either the machine works or it doesn't or it's lumping along and weget short quite severely on output. So yes. I mean, J.B., do you want to add?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, I think that's spot on. Because the design on a whole is much easier to build...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. By a lot.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerBut the -- it's also intensely automated, which is part of what lets us realize the margin in the cost targets.But that does become difficult to bring that automation online. That's really -- that's where we are.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd Doug is on the line. Perhaps he can add some on ease of manufacturability.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderDoug, do you want to maybe cite a few examples?John Douglas FieldSenior Vice President of EngineeringSure. The number of actual, what we call a pitch, which is a station for a robot to work on the car ingeneral assembly, is about 1/4 of the typical industry average for number of stations it uses to build acar.

And it's -- this is the positive virtuous cycle of cash flowof working capital that Model 3 provides us, because we effectively pay our suppliers later when we collectfrom our customers.

I'm just trying to understand, Deepak, how much of that $2.5 billionin the inventory is finished goods that you might be able to sell out of in theFourth quarter."

Just with regard to the ramp-up of the Model 3 production, I can see what's happening with the5,000 per week target from 1Q to 4Q -- or from, now, it's 1Q versus 4Q. But I think it's less clear fromreading the letter, what's happening with the previous guidance of the 10,000 units per week at somepoint in 2018? Is that now like beyond 2018? I think, before, investors were estimating that if you couldhit it at the end of '18, you'd do over 250,000 vehicles. If you could hit it more towards the middle, you'ddo over 325,000. But what now would be a reasonable expectation based upon what you know for theModel 3s that do get built in 2018?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSo it's a bit too early to make the exact number. But I think, if you extrapolate from 5,000 units towardsthe end of Q1, we do want to hold off on giving CapEx until we are confident about cash flow on Model 3.So then that's a question of how long it takes to implement everything necessary to get to 10,000 units aweek for Model 3, which is a number we are confident can be sustained from a [ grand ] standpoint.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd we want to figure out how much we can push the 5,000 up from the existing equation.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, that is true.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd then learn from those and figure out, how do we redesign what will we do for the next step and spendmore efficiently our CapEx? So it's the right thing to do.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Yes, exactly. As I mentioned earlier, we're finding that some parts of the line, they very clearly arecapable of 6,000 or that 7,000 units a week, and maybe more than that, just by shortening path length,speeding up robots, adding some robots where there are -- where the choke points exist, simplifying someof the processes and a few minor part redesigns sum up for how much you can improve cycle time.

BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOh, I was just going to say, is the gross margin discussion also related to this at all? I mean, I see thereduced outlook for 4Q, but do you feel any differently about, for example, the ability to do 25% marginwhen you're doing kind of 250,000 run rate? And as long as the production is going to be restrained,do you have any ability to continue to preference for longer maybe the higher-margin, higher trim levelvariance of the Model 3 to help with that?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerWe can fine-tune those things when we get there, but overall, our -- and I'm reinforcing this again, theseare all short-term issues, and it doesn't change our long-term prognosis on Model 3 gross margin.",

MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I think first of all, I think, at the end of the day, everything is our fault and my problem, most ofall. If we picked the wrong subcontractor, we're the fault. So just -- I don't want us to be -- sort of usexternalizing responsibility. Really, it's our fault for picking the wrong supplier and then not realizing ituntil way later in the game. We will be able to call back some amounts, but it certainly will not make upfor the lost revenue, the lost free cash flow. So some amount, yes, but it's not going to matter that much.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThe goal is right now to fix the problem.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, exactly.Alexander Eugene PotterPiper Jaffray Companies, Research DivisionOkay, fair enough. I guess, one other issue, you referenced a gross margin headwind on the S and X dueto trim and mix.

Jon you want to answer?Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceYes, it's Jon. I can address a piece of this. So a large chunk of it was discontinued trims. We've introducedthe 100-kilowatt battery pack, which has a 335-mile range in Model S. And as a result of that, wediscontinued the 90-kilowatt pack. And as those cars were in inventory, we reduced price to move themout. And so that was a piece of the gross margin headwind that won't repeat in -- as we go forward.And in addition to that, the mix did shift. We sold more 100-kilowatt cars actually than we predicted wewould, but order rate went up for the 75s even faster. And so we sold more 75-kilowatt cars in the mixthan we'd predicted, and that had a gross margin impact as well. Given demand is in -- it continues toincrease for the 100-kilowatt pack and the mix shift is occurring more towards that product, we'll see, aswe indicated in the letter, increasing margins as we roll into Q4 and then into Q1.",

We also just needed a bunch of people on the Model 3line. So we thought we'll take the third shift from Model S and the X and apply it to Model 3. Becausereally, running out of labor pool, honestly.

Well, it's because the entire supply chain, all the parts,everything's got to go to 2,500, and that requires a bunch of CapEx. Then you got to match sort of --the increase stores.

Do we have higher CapEx and higher growth or lower CapEx and lower growth? Yes.So it's -- if we do that we can move that lever where it makes sense, where it makes sense to do so. Asmentioned earlier though, we want to make sure we know what to scale before we spend money on it.And so for the Model 3, figuring out which production lines can be simply accelerated and which productionlines need to be duplicated.

Usually, Tesla's been all about doing as much as quickly as possible to leadthe move to electrification, to establish a first-mover advantage, et cetera. So is the hesitancy in goingall-out growth?

So we openeda location just about every 4 days in Q3. And to get ahead of that demand, you probably saw that weput 180 mobile vehicles on the road, and we plan to double that this quarter.

And when these cars get sold, thedepreciation related to those cars gets recognized in COGS.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. They are capitalized as inventory because these cars are salable. And whenthey're transferred to be sold, what's the accounting on that?"

And final assemblyobviously makes sense, given constraints elsewhere. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit aboutwelding. And then as you get to your year-end run rate, is there still going to be a discrepancy betweensort of different parts of the entire line? Or do you think everything is going to be roughly at the samelevel?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerDoug, would you like to take that on?John Douglas FieldSenior Vice President of EngineeringWell, with respect to welding, the rate is controlled by -- are you specifically asking about the video? Or doyou have another...Joseph Robert SpakRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research DivisionI'm sorry. In the letter, it said body shop welding is listed as a constraint.John Douglas FieldSenior Vice President of EngineeringYes, it was not the same constraints.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerIt wasn't listed as a constraint. Yes.John Douglas FieldSenior Vice President of EngineeringIt's not the same level of constraint as the Gigafactory, but it is one of the more complex parts of theoverall assembly line. So to reach our overall production goals, that has to ramp significantly. But again,it's not at the same level of constraint as modules. And it's really driven just by the sheer number ofrobots in the body shop. It's the highest concentration of robots anywhere in our overall production line.But it is coming up well. The bodies that we're building are of excellent quality. We've had fantastic crashresults in testing them. And we're building more and more every day. We're ahead of the rest of theproduction curve.Joseph Robert SpakRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research DivisionOkay. And then as a follow-up on the capital question, I mean, Elon, I think, a year ago on this call, yousaid to go from 5,000 to 10,000 was -- would require a fair amount of capital, but you were confidentthat it'd be less than you're going 0 to 5,000. And now that you have some real-world experience with theramp, I'm wondering if you have any different views there, if you could put a little bit of a finer point onthat comment.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. I don't think -- I mean, we actually feel even more strongly that our efficiency of CapEx on the nextphase will be significant compared to the first phase.Elon R.

And then also, if you could talk a little bit about why you felt that it wasnecessary to add value to the Model S and Model X while lowering price. It seems like you should be ableto drive volumes with one or the other.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, I think, to the first question, I would say it's roughly about 5% of [ total sales ]Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceYes. Very -- yes. Very low single digits in terms of service loaner sales as a percentage of total units.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. We -- as far as the prices, it was -- Model X was always -- it was really the one that saw more of aprice reduction than other things. And then the 100-kilowatt hour pack, which was -- 100-kilowatt packcars was artificially priced high because we were production -- like really production-constrained on thatpack. It was never our intention to price it quite that high, so we reduced it a little bit and then addedsome content as to both. So we just sort of split it between some price reductions where we thoughtthings were a little overpriced, and then added some content just to have a clear differentiation. Weweren't quite sure what the response would be to the Model 3. So maybe we might have overcorrected alittle bit, but that's kind of where it is.Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionOkay. And then just moving to the China strategy. Obviously, with the permanent magnet requirementsfor the DC motor for the Model 3 and what we've seen historically with export restrictions in China andimproved environmental enforcement in terms of mining practices, how important is that to the strategy ofmoving into China and maintaining your supply lines for the growth of the Model 3?Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceI think we think about China more from a demand side than anything. We're building complete cars andshipping them. We're shipping them across the ocean and into the largest electric vehicle market in theworld. So what really pulls us into China primarily is to be able to supply that market and to make the carsmore affordable, as Elon said, so that we're not forcing consumers to experience tariffs as we bring thosecars in.",

I recognize it's not the biggest focus right now, but I'm just curious on solar declining as youexpected, but just wondering when you think that can start growing again. Is that a function of SolarRoof? Or is that sort of moving past your sales changes? And then, I guess, similarly on energy storage,the ramp looking -- sort of exiting this year into 2018, is that constrained by the Model 3? Or is that on itsown separate track?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, we are -- we do expect the solar demand to rebound as we move solar sales into all of our stores,which is a much more efficient channel for demand generation. And that's just what's sort of conventionalsolar. The Solar Roof stuff, we expect, is going to be at -- or well, we're confident it's going to haveextremely high demand. And we're just going through the validation process for the solar trials. It does --and they're working right now, I should point out. So I have the Solar Roof tiles on my house. So -- andI don't even notice that they're there because they blend in so well. But they -- so they look really goodbut a roof is expected to last a long time. So at least 25, 30 years. And so there's some rate at which wecan do accelerated life testing on -- for the rest of the component. So we can maybe try to accelerate lifetesting on a 30-year roof in sort of 6 months, but it's hard to do it in less than about that 6 months. Soand then we're going to pack that into the production process. So I have no doubt that this will be a verysignificant part of the business down the road, it just takes a little while to get this behemoth rolling.
