Mr. Viecha, you may now proceed.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Cherie, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2019 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of otherexecutives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 2 p.m. Pacific time in the update letter wepublished at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectThanks, Martin. On Monday, we hosted our first-ever Autonomy Investor Day, showcasing our newin-house designed full self-driving computer and our AI-based software trained by more than400,000 Tesla vehicles. All Tesla cars being built today have all the hardware necessary for fullself-driving, and over the year updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailingnetwork fleet and generate income which, as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago, we think issomewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 a year, in some cases, perhaps more. We're the onlycompany in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chipfor full self-driving. We're in a position unlike anyone else in the industry. And in 2020, we expectto have 1 million robotaxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving. We believewe'll have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps the -- yes.",

        "original_text": "Last quarter,we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North Americaexperienced last year as well as a massive increase in delivery volume to China.As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have because we booked vehicles and consumersbought them, but this rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resultedin over half of our global deliveries occurring in the final 10 days of Q1.This was the most difficult logistics problem I've ever seen, and I've seen some tough ones. So I'llsay it again, equipment fleet delivered the half of all vehicles produced -- delivered all half -- alldeliveries occurred literally in the final 10 days of Q1. As a result, a large number of vehicles -- the vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2 which, of course, Q1net income to be negatively impacted. As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customersspecifically in time. In response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehiclebooked throughout the quarter. This will make the -- this will put much less strain on Tesla, resultsin a much better delivery experience for customers and have a very positive effect on our workingcapital in the middle of the quarter.In Q1, Model 3 was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner-up byalmost 60%. It's worth to dwell on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared topredictions that were made several years ago. There were literally, to the best of my knowledge, 0predictions that this would happen, if you go back just even 5 or 6 years ago, that an electric carwould be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe, over time, we'll be the best-selling premium car throughout the world.And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever. Andthat'd be something similar in Switzerland as well. So these were really incredible achievements bythe Tesla team.Since the introduction of Standard Range and Standard Range Plus, nearly 70% of trade-ins fromModel 3 have actually been nonpremium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car thanthey have ever paid for a car.",

        "original_text": "They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because theywant the Model 3 more than they ever wanted a vehicle, they're willing to pay more to get a Model3.And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model 3 has just begun, and this segment is vastlylarger internationally than it is in the U.S. We're continuing to make significant improvements to ourvehicle lineup, including updating the Model S and X production line to accommodate the nextgeneration of powertrains. So we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with thesignificantly more balanced powertrains for the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to thesuspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension system and to enable chargingat 200 kilowatts, which is -- and there are a number of other small changes. If anyone is thinkingabout upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it. And we also introduced the loyaltyprogram where if somebody has -- is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance Model Sor X, they get the Ludicrous upgrade for free. So this is -- yes, as a thank you and an appreciation toexisting Tesla customers.So they have a longer range. The Model S now has a range of 370 miles. This is actually EPA rangeof 370 miles, and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop all the way fromSan Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds. And they said they could have even gonefaster. And there weren't any headwind as well. So this is pretty remarkable that an electric carcould go nonstop between the 2 biggest cities in California. I mean, I remember back when I wasdriving gasoline cars, I always had to stop at a gas station. This is literally better than a gasoline carwith the rare exception. And there's also an increase in power. It accelerates faster. Just better, betterin every way. And we're able to this without increasing the size of the battery pack, which is atestament to the powertrain team for it to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain bysuch a significant margin.So with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continuedexpansion of Model 3 globally, we expect our order rate to increase significantly throughout theyear and commensurate with our production levels.",

And I think Zach -- Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, thank you, Martin, and thanks, Elon, as well. Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, thiswas one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in the history of the company. And itwas ambitious even by Tesla's own standard. The global expansion of Model 3 was a huge themewithin the quarter. We launched the Standard Range lineup for Model 3, product retooling forModel S and Model X, which Elon just talked about with the range enhancements and suspensionupgrades, and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and worked to do thecorresponding impact that had on our order mix in deliverable cars. So there's 2 key themes that I'dlike to discuss briefly, and then we'll open it up to Q&A, around cash and profitability for thequarter.First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. Thiswas a $1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to 2factors. The first is that we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1. Note for those of youlooking to the cash flow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows.The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact ofexpanding Model 3 operations overseas. And the 2 components to this which we have discussed, isthat an international operation naturally commands additional working capital because of transittimes, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not all of our cars will bedelivered. Both of these factors which occurred in Q1 we do not expect to repeat in Q2.",

        "original_text": "And weexpect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going forward. I'll also note thatwe're tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries for a month 1 in the history of thecompany.On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10days of the quarter. This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarterand then U.S. local builds in the second half. This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEAand China and significantly stressed the delivery operations. Note, we also faced import issues inShanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries towards the finalcouple of days and weeks in the quarter. So we're addressing this by regionally on balance -- bybuilding regionally balanced, and we've already executed on this for Model 3, and S and X will beimplemented in the next week or 2.The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter. Sowe don't have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the peak. We expectsignificant cost savings to come from this.On the P&L side, we incurred $188 million of one-time adjustments that flowed through to netincome. $120 million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced onFebruary 28. This included a reserve for a potential increased return rate for our Residual ValueGuarantee and Buyback Guarantee of vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of ourused Tesla inventory and service deliveries. There's an additional $67 million related to Q1restructuring and other charges that flowed through.Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue wasnegatively impacted by $501 million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline indeliveries.Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately 28 -- to20%. This is due to 2 factors. One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February 28 as wellas a mix shift towards the Standard Range lineup which we launched. We also successfullyexecuted on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact.",

        "original_text": "Labor content, warehousing andscrap, as examples, all had double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1.In spite of launching the Standard Range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs areclose to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being for long-range variants of Model 3.In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant. Two major pieces here: the volumereduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our margin as well as thepricing actions that we took on February 28. Even though S and X had been in production for awhile, we still continue to make operational improvements there, the labor content as an example,which improved quarter-over-quarter.As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon's sentiments about the excitement of our productlineup. But from a financial standpoint, what we've effectively done here is build an incredible baseof knowledge and assets that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around theworld.So Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this. As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing upcapacity 50% for Giga Shanghai as compared to the Model 3 in the U.S., and that 50%, our internalforecast that we're executing against, is actually better than that.And Model Y , as we've noted, is built on the Model 3 platform, so we're able to leverage theknowledge there for capital-efficient expansion.In energy as well, as we've noted previously, 2019 is a big year for storage, so a lot of excitingimprovements coming there. And the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilizesome of the assets that we've made investments in that.So just to conclude the opening remarks here, I've personally never felt more excited about thefuture of the company, and I'm looking forward to the discussion.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, Zachary.

There's not a whole lot of things holding it back. We're on schedule. We're on track. Rightnow, we're looking to close in mid-May.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. The second question is, is Tesla considering and creating an insurance program in orderto further simplify the ownership experience and to more accurately take into account safety ofdriving an Autopilot?

The next question is, Elon, most people when they think of Tesla onlysee it as an automotive company. Can you speak to the energy side of the company, specifically theroad map for when you see the energy side of things really taking off and generating major revenuefor the company?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectSure. The challenge really is battery cell scarcity. As far as the stationary storage is concerned, webasically need an upsell to support the vehicle production as well as to both Powerwall andPowerpack. Last year, in order to have enough cells for Model 3, we actually had to convert all ofthe lines of the Gigafactory to produce cells just for the Model 3 as opposed to Powerwall,Powerpack. And so we're essentially scrounging cells from all around the world to, at least,continue some level of production on the Powerwall and Powerpack. This year, we think that we'llbe able to allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of cell outputs. [I incur] J.B., like what do you guysthink?Jeffrey B. Straubel - Tesla, Inc. - CTOYes.Elon R.

        "original_text": "So there are far fewer cells in a Powerwall than in a car, so that translates to quite a decentnumber of Powerwalls. And then we will continue to use cells from various suppliers around theworld. The Powerwall and Powerpack, because they don't have to go through vehicle homologation,are much more adaptable to using a variety of cells from other cell providers. So are we expectingthat Powerwall and Powerpack to see a very significant percentage growth this year, maybe on theorder of 300% or some quite high number. Sorry? Sorry? Yes, 300%. I guess he was just confirmingit, 300%. So this is a very big percentage growth rate. It's much faster than an automotive. So overtime, we would expect that to -- that sort of growth rate we hope will be able to continue and thenbattery storage will become a bigger and bigger percentage of Tesla's business over time. We alsohave -- we're also planning a significant increase in retrofit solar this year because we've finallyrefined the product offering to be something that's extremely compelling and much more costefficient to deliver and install. So a radically streamlined process from what has been done before,and we'll have more to say on that possibly next week. And then the Solar Roof tile, we're onversion 3 of the design. That necessarily takes a while to scale up because we have to be confidentthat the Solar Roof is going to last for on the order of 30 years and because the warranty is sort of20, 25 years. And so the rate at which you can iterate on Solar Roof is necessarily slowed down bythe -- according to the rate which you can do accelerated aging on the roof.

How soon should current owners that purchased FSD getthe new FSD computer?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI think the -- from features and functionality standpoint, I think there's no point getting the FSDupgrade if you don't really have it in the car for probably about 2 or 3 months. That's when we'llstart releasing features that are materially different from the feature set available on the version 2hardware. So just no need to rush to the -- get your computer replaced. It's like 2 to 3 months beforeit becomes relevant. And then it will obviously increase rapidly from then. One other comment I'llmake in case, since nobody asked this explicitly. For Model Y production, we are right now tryingto decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California or Nevada, and we expect tomake a final decision on that very soon. But in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling andequipment required for Model Y . So we don't expect this to, in any way, delay production of ModelY , but it's currently a very close call between Nevada and California as to whether we do the ModelY at Giga or at Fremont.

Canyou talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth? And in particular what theorder book or reservation list may be telling you?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes. The -- we do see strong demand for vehicles, the -- both S, X and 3.

Soit's -- I think we'll see a lot of interest and demand in that. We are. And then with the upgraded Sand X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X upgrade, and thisreally is kind of a game changer of an upgrade. So I think we are seeing an uptick in demand, andwe expect to see that to be quite significant. So -- and we're also out of the seasonality of Q1 with afew people just generally don't like buying cars in winter, and we're getting past the overhang ofthat tax credit cliff which, for us, ended in the U.S. on December 31.

You see -- based on what you saw in April, do you think that the 25,000 units per quarter isthe level of demand that is where you see the market coming back already? Or are we not there yet?And more specifically, in the U.S., the pull forward in Q4 could hurt a lot of demand for S and X? Isthat something that you still see in the numbers today in recent weeks? Or is that behind us? And I'llhave a follow-up on Q2.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes. I mean, I think something like the -- returning to the 100,000 a year annualized demand for Sand X is what we anticipate. That's to the best of my knowledge. We don't have a crystal ball, butthat's probably our best guess. And sorry, what was the other part?Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureMy question was about the run rate of demand you see at the moment. Do you still feel like weakdemand in the U.S. because of the pull forward in Q4? Or do you think demand returned to normalalready?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI think we expect demand to -- we are seeing demand returning to normal in Q2. And it might be alittle better than normal. It's -- I don't have a crystal ball, so it's hard for me to say, but myimpression right now is that demand is quite solid, quite strong, yes.Pierre C.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectSorry, Zachary would probably like to...Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. But just one thing I wanted to add to that, just on the production side of S and X. We didreduce production in Q1, as was noted. That was part of the retooling that we put in place to get thelonger-range vehicle out with the improved suspension.",

So maybe if you could take usthrough where we will see in Q2 pain points compared to Q4 and Q3, where you had a profit forsimilar volumes. How much of the loss in Q2 would be the one-off costs? How much is the pricepoints coming down in the mix? And how much is related to pricing and other things?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectSure. So quite a bit -- but we think if we didn't unwind or pulled the wave where we, yes, made carsin the first half of the quarter almost exclusively for Asia and Europe and the second half almostexclusively for North America, and then actually even that is subdivided depending upon whetherit's West Coast or East Coast, then we could deliver more cars. But we think it is important tounwind this wave because it ends up being sort of optimizing for 1 quarter, but really adding a lot ofcost and difficulty and not just -- not being a good experience for customers and putting great stresson the Tesla team. So if we were to fully optimize for profitability in Q2, I think we could do it, butthen we would be unable to unwind this crazy wave of deliveries. And it also helps on workingcapital within the quarter to not have the wave.",

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystElon, I was wondering if you could talk about this whole notion of raising capital. For about the lastyear, you sort of eschewed it as almost an evil thing, and I think a lot of investors believe that thecompany might be better served in its growth aspirations if it did raise capital or had a stronger cashbase. And given that you used up about $2 billion worth of cash in the quarter, aren't you potentiallytrying to go through a very thin space while trying to grow quickly and be self-funding, which,quite frankly, may be unrealistic? So why not raise capital? And why do you view that as somethingthat Tesla shouldn't do or wouldn't do? And I have a follow-up, please.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes. I don't think raising capital should be a substitute for making the company operate moreeffectively. So that in that sense, I think it's just -- it's important to have a strong financial disciplineof the company and just -- to make sure we don't have extraneous expenses and that we're just beingfrugal with capital. If we just keep raising capital every time, then it just takes -- we don't have theforcing function for improving the fundamental operation of the business.

        "summary": "Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI think we don't want to comment on the granularity of deposits. We're not playing up the Model Y because we're not -- it's not in production. So you can'treally read anything into Model Y orders at this point. The next level of U.S. credit phasing out July 1. We don't comment on future price changes unless you see it publicly. The last question was on customer deposits, it looks like it's essentially flat to maybe slightly down. Iunderstand there's probably some timing with deliveries that could have helped it towards the endof the quarter. But we would have thought it would have increased given the ModelY unveil."

Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior AnalystOkay. And then as you look at the Maxwell Technology and integration, post close, how quickly doyou think you'll be able to integrate that technology into the battery production? And could youcomment on potential for chemistry and form-factor changes as that gets integrated?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYou're really asking some super secret sauce questions here. Yes, I think we'll have a -- I think we'llprobably have an Investor Day like the Autonomy Day maybe later this year or early next just to goover the cell and battery technology and future strategy. I think that will be very informative, but wedo recognize the criticality of this.",

        "original_text": "Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.Joseph Robert Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - AnalystFirst question is really just a clarification on -- in the outlook of 25% non-GAAP gross margin thatyou're targeting. Is that over the mid-term? Or is that something you expect to hit by the end of thisyear? And if so, what gets S and X back higher given the price cuts?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, this is Zach here. That guidance that we're targeting for the end of the year. Althoughinternally, we're working towards S and X non-GAAP gross margin achieving that sooner. Thebiggest lever there is actually 2 components. One is, as we increase volume back on our S and Xproduction line, there's just a natural benefit there from the fixed cost absorption which will help us.But we also have a number of cost reduction projects in place that we're executing on over thecourse of the year. And then the third piece which applies to S and X, but also Model 3, we'reseeing an increased take rate on our full self-driving offering. And there are revenue deferralsassociated with that given that the full suite of functionality is not there. And as that option becomes-- approaches sees us continually roll out more, we will be able to have more revenue on that. Andso all of these things together within our internal plans gives us confidence.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, we should -- I should mention that the upgraded powertrain for S and X was actually results ina significant cost down because we essentially took the high volume rear-drive units of the Model 3,which is extremely efficient but [the same magnet motor and power] electronics already in it and wemade a version for that -- of that for the front-drive unit of S and X. And so we're actually able toget a cost reduction while improving range and performance of the car. That's just one example.Joseph Robert Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - AnalystOkay. And the second question is just looking at the 10-K, you've continually noticed $4.9 billionpurchase obligation, which I think is primarily related to Panasonic Giga 1. And then Elon, in someof your communication, you've indicated production constraints.",

So what is the logic of the price cuts during the quarter?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI mean, our goal, as we've been very clear about from beginning of the company, is to make ourcars as affordable as possible. And we thought it was important to offer the $35,000 Model 3 andthen to create a sort of bundled package for the Model 3 with the increased range because we thinkactually that difference between 220 and 240 is quite important, the more point people realize inrange and having a posher premium interior and then finally, Autopilot. So we thought those -- [likewe went and paired like] product that's really just nailed the sweet spot, which I think the $39,000 --$39,500 Model 3 is just really nailed the sweet spot and we're seeing consumer responseaccordingly. People can still buy the $35,000 version of the Model 3 that, of course, didn't haveAutopilot and has a software range restriction, that kind of thing. It's like slightly more inconvenientto buy. You just have to make a phone call or visit a store. So it's just not like you have to completethe obstacle course or something. But we see very few people actually taking us up on that $35,000offer, but it is there and will remain there.Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director in the General IndustrialsGroup and AnalystAnd as a follow-up, you're still targeting the China facility ramp by the end of the year. Are you stillconfident in the 3,000 per week? And do you have a battery supplier yet that's getting pretty close tothat point?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, the Shanghai Gigafactory progress is going incredibly well, a testament to the outstandingexecution of our team on the ground there. I get daily e-mails with Tesla pictures from one day tothe next from [Tong Zhu], who leads the Gigafactory program.",
