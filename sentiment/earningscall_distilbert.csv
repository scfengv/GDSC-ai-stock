But we did go too far in the automation front andautomated some pretty silly things. 5Machines are not good at picking up pieces of fluff, okay. Human hands are way better at doing that. Andso we had a super complicated machine using a vision system to try to put a piece of fluffle on the batterypack. That same -- and one of the questions asked was, ""Do we actually need that?"" So we tested a carwith and without and found that there was no change in the noise volume in the cabin. So that was one of one ofthe silliestthings I found.",negative,0.7650593519210815

So -- and then result is we've had aradical improvement in production -- battery pack production went from taking 7 hours to make a pack 3weeks ago to under [ 70 ] minutes now, so just to show that it's like really radical improvement.

This is coming from a standing start against alot of established brands who have far more sales outlets than we do, so this is very encouraging. And yes, as this letter says, I'm feeling quite confident about achieving GAAP net income andpositive cash flow in Q3. We aregoing to conduct sort of a reorganization restructuring of the company in the next -- this month and makesure we're well set up to achieve that goal. And in particular, the number of sort of third-party contractingcompanies that we're using has really gotten out of control. It's pretty crazy. You've got barnacles on barnacles.

4,"Elon R. Musk: I think a 5-day, 2-shift operation is a ridiculous way to operate because that wouldbe a very poor use of CapEx. Most of Tesla production has operated around 24/7 basis since we startedproduction. It really makes great use of the CapEx and the lines, andthat's why we did it, starting way back at the beginning of S. But aligning everything to the same shiftschedule makes it so much more efficient because we don't have the seesaw of inventory, the underlying inventory between the different shops. And one of the key things to improving the capital efficiency of the system is reducing work inprogress -- work in process. But it's -- this is sort of a -- we're using the chip fab approach to capitalefficiency, so it's called [indiscernible]. I don't know where it says what.",negative,0.6982455253601074

If you make like -- if 2 companies are competing and one has to double its CapEx in order todouble production and the other one can, with minor CapEx, can just speed up the line by double, it's agame over. It's like 0 maintenance time and 0 -- like you have todo equipmentupgrades. It can't be like that. It has to be some starts, some stops to get to 5,000 per week.

So Ithink to actually -- I do not see this having a much of a long-term impact in our cost. I actually see it mostlikely our cost will decrease, or we consider the cost to producing the vehicles will decrease by getting ridof production stations that are really poorly suited to robotics because of the very expensive cost of robottechnicians.Deepak Ahuja: We are very CapEx efficient, or let me just start from that point.

So is there any update on that front?Elon R. Musk: No, I don't think there is. It's the hardestthing in the world to scale production. Prototypes are easy.

And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it's really just incredible specs all around. I think we will make as -- about as many as we can sell for many years. It's going to be pretty nuts. So -- and I think, actually, the productis better than people realize even. They don't even have enough information to realize just theawesomeness of it, It's just great.

177,"This past year was truly transformational for Tesla, and I want to thankeveryone who's been a part of making this happen. On demand, we've transitioned entirelyfrom generating Model 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand. We've also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs, even increasing slightly in Q4. And we've seen anincrease in ASPs of S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2. So where will we be in 10 years? Very excited to consider the prospect.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, Elon. And Zach has some opening remarks as well.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla - CFOYes.

We've also made progress on recurring software-based revenue with the implementationof premium connectivity and the beginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobileapp. As we look ahead to 2020, this, again, will be an important year for the company. Our task ahead isto execute on the next phase of growth while managing cash flows to support that growth. For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality. We are also in the early stages ofunderstanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the coronavirus. At thispoint, we're expecting a 1- to 1.5-week delay in the ramp of Shanghai-built Model 3 due to agovernment-required factory shutdown. OnModel Y , we expect first deliveries in limited quantities later this quarter and will ramp oversubsequent quarters. As mentioned previously, we are forecasting higher gross margins on Model Ycompared to the Model 3.",neutral,0.548180878162384

It's difficult to predict what the demand will be thisyear, except that the demand is very strong. And we are working also not just through Tesla SolarRoof but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whetherit's in North America, on the order of 4 million new roofs per year. So we see a lot of interest. And so it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do theinstallation. And I think people will want a live roof that generates power andlooks good and lasts a long time, and it's the future we want. And the Buffalo factory is doing great.

181,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorSure. Yes, probably, we'll have Superchargers in airports. We'll have superchargers whereverwe see that there is a need for Super chargers. And then on the insurance part of the question, it is our intent to allow people to put their cars intoride-sharing or the FSD network using Tesla Insurance. That's not currently the case, but by thetime that this is available, it's ourintent to get that ready. And last part of question was, will there be a discount for using Autopilot with our cars? Elon, go ahead, Zach.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla - CFOYes, thank you. Next question from retail investors is, ""how many California owners are currentlyinsured with Tesla Insurance? What's the target for Tesla Insurance in 2020?""",neutral,0.6796356439590454
182,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorOh, yes. Yes, there will be. The rate card for California, Tesla Insurance already considers the safety features associated withAutopilot. But I think it would make sense for us to close loop on higher use of Autopilot for it reducesthe insurance cost as well as the probability of injury. So I think insurance is going to be, I think,quite a major product of Tesla over time. The amount of money that people spend on car insuranceis like a remarkably big percentage of the cost of a car. You can lease a Model 3 right now for $400a month, but a typical owner in California will be paying sort of between $100 and $200 a month ininsurance.",neutral,0.49647057056427

And we're really onlybeginning to take full advantage of the Autop Pilot hardware, the FSD hardware. So I think it's -- theapparent progress, as seen by consumers, will seem to be extremely rapid. But actually, what'sreally going on, it seems like that is just having the foundational software be very strong, havereally strong foundation. And then a really fundamental thing is moving to video training. This is a really -- I mean, in terms of labelingefficiency, arguably like a 3 order of magnitude improvement in labeling efficiency. So that's really great progress on that. And the last retail investor question comes from Kendall. ""Since most retail investorsseem to understand Tesla better than analysts and are risking a larger part of their own personalwealth on Tesla, doesn't it make sense to take mostly questions on these earnings calls from us?""",positive,0.7838002443313599
184,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think there's a pretty big fundamental efficiency gain that Tesla has by just making cars,especially affordable cars than 3 and Y , at least on the continent where the customers are. But what we're doing -- or have been doing in the past was really pretty silly, makingcars in California and then shipping them halfway around the world to Asia and Europe. And thiscreated a lot of cost because you've got to ship those cars. So we're not shipping cars from California over to China. And then that has a correspondingsavings on our lower import-related costs. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that the costof the Standard Plus that we're selling out of Shanghai is also lower than that of the similar carcoming out of Fremont, from price perspective.",negative,0.6486566066741943
185,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we're actually spending money as quickly as we can spend it sensibly. There is no artificial holdback on expenditures. And then despite all that, we are still generating positive cash. So in light of that, it doesn'tmake sense to raise money because we expect to generate cash despite this growth level. And just having a factory in China or a factory. in California or afactory in North America and a. factory in Europe, just that alone, is a massive improvement in ourfundamental operating efficiency.

186,"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely. We did see an increase in operatingexpenses from Q3 to Q4, even excluding the portion of that attributed to stock-based compensation. But I think we're at a point now where OpEx will start to tick up, at least if you lookannually from 2019 to 2020, to support our international footprint and then the growth of thecompany. Our job is to grow that significantly slower than the pace of growth of revenue to improvethe operating leverage, which we're very, very focused on. And the last question from investors is, ""the sales of model S and X have stayed flat forseveral quarters. The main reason is that they still use 18650 batteries. When will S andX use 2170batteries? Manufacturing capacity of 18650 may be used for battery storage systems instead.""",neutral,0.5829560160636902

We -- except to say that like as I said earlier, we're spending money as fast aswe can spend money in sensible ways. So it's definitely not artificially limited, and we will spend --well, a lot of money is here, for sure. The challenge comes in like finding efficient ways to actuallydeploy the capital. That's the harder part than sort of deciding on a CapEx number really. And I think we always find ways to become more CapEx efficient per unit of capacity. And wechallenge the teams to always become more efficient. And so we see a reduction per CapEx -- perunit in terms of Capex.",neutral,0.4572436809539795

Is that something that's feasible for you guys to execute on, on aconsistent basis, a level of capacity building that large?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOI mean, I think...Elon R. Musk - Tesla,. Inc. -- Founder, CEO & DirectorWe're heading for more than 30%, yes. And just back on your first question, we will have additional detail on CapEx in the 10-K.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we don't comment on those detailed numbers, except the demand is just far more than wecould reasonably make in the space of, I don't know, 3 or 4 years or something like that. So we've got to really make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery productionand continue to improve the cost per kilowatt hour of the batteries. This is very fundamental andextremely difficult. So I said we're going to do like kind of Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this and whatour plans are.

With the release of Smart Summon in the U.S., we were able to recognize $30 million ofdeferred revenue. Our services and other loss reduced yet again, reflecting our focus to improve the efficiency of thisarea of the business. And we further reduced operating expenses despite increased orders, deliveriesand new programs in development. And finally, on net income -- in other income, we saw benefits from foreign exchange which, as Imentioned last quarter, we don't hedge. The global order rate remains strong andcontinues to increase. Despite increases to production levels, our order backlog has been growing. And quarter-to-date orders are significantly higher than at this point in last quarter.

In the last 3 months, we relaunched Tesla solar in North America by simplifying our solar offeringinto 3 sizes of small, medium and large. And our energy storage deployment, which includes Powerwalls andPowerpacks, grew by 15% to an all-time high of 477 megawatt hours. We remain focused on reducing cost, which enables rapid investments infuture programs and growth.

Tesla solar is easy because we have one of thelowest prices in the nation now -- in the country. We were ableto lower our prices because our cost of acquisition is now less than 1/4 of any typical solarcompany. We've done many residential installs with a single visitto a customer's home because the standard sizes are reduced complexity. On solar, we want to simplify the fulfillment process with agoal of really fast order-to-install time lines.

You can tell which homes have Powerwall because that's where all the light -- thats where thelights are on. It's like a single truck roll. And every button -- a massive number ofhousing approval authorities to take a generic template as opposed to a custom template, whichmakes it (inaudible) and in most cases, I think electronic as well.

We're taking it from where the solar industry would often be 3visits before the solar was installed and would often take quite a long time to do the installation. Butwe streamlined all of that to a point where, in many cases, it's a single visit to do everything, and it'sfast. And ordering solar is literally 1 click. Youcan order solar for your house in less than 1 minute. And then we've done the same thing in the commercial solar space. Nobody thought of puttinga simple website with order -- with prices for commercial solar. We do that now. And we've seen agood response from small businesses wanting to go solar. And by removing the complexity of long-term contracts and simplifying the terms and conditions, commercial solar sales process would typically take 6 months is now taking a couple of weeks.

I think it could be bigger, but it's certainly of a similarmagnitude, Tesla solar, meaning Tesla solar plus battery stuff is -- to Tesla Energy is, I think, theleast appreciated element. And part of it is like for about 18 months, almost 2years, we had to divert a tremendous amount of resources to Model 3 production.

And so that's going to be, I think, the really crazy growth for as far as future as I canimagine. But we had to do it because if we didn't solve Model 3, Tesla wouldn't survive.

News reports suggest that Gigafactory 3 already -- may already beproducing Model 3s for Chinese markets.
