2021-04-26,"But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaGreat. Thank you. So Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels. Tesla achieved recordproduction, deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the ï¬?rst time. Andwe've seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and our demand is the best we'veever seen. So this is -- [we're talking about] we're used to seeing a reduction in demand in the ï¬?rstquarter, and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demandin in Q1.So Model 3 became the best-selling midsized premier sedan in the world, in fact, I should say thebest-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world. The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time thebest-selling premium sedan, has been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3. And this is only 3.5 yearsinto production and was just 2 factories. For Model 3 to be outselling its combustion enginecompetitors, I think, is quite remarkable.In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly 0.25 million Model 3s, so -- which translates toannualized rate of 0.5 million per year.When it comes to Model Y , we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind inthe world and probably next year. So I'm not 100% certain next year, but I think it's quite likely. I'dsay more likely than not, that in 2022, Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.Then with regard to Full Self-Driving. Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress. It isdeï¬?nitely one of the -- I think one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that's maybe everexisted. And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty signiï¬?cant part ofartiï¬?cial intelligence, speciï¬?cally real-world artiï¬?cial intelligence. And that sort of AI, the neuralnet needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efï¬?cient computer that wasdesigned, but nonetheless, a small computer that's using on the order of 70 or 80 watts. So this is amuch harder problem than if you were you, say, 10,000 computers in a server room or somethinglike that.This has got to ï¬?t into a [smaller sprain]. And this -- I think with the elimination of radar, we'reï¬?nally getting rid of one of the last crutches. Radar was really -- it was making up for some of theshortfalls of vision, but this is not good.","Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels.

2021-04-26,"You actually just need vision to work. And when [beam]works, it works better than the best human because it's like having 8 cameras, it's like having eyesin the back of your head, beside your head and has 3 eyes of different focal distances lookingforward. This is -- and processing it at a speed that is superhuman. There's no question in my mindthat with a pure vision solution, we can make a car that is dramatically safer than the average[person].So -- but it is a hard problem because we are actually solving something quite fundamental aboutartiï¬?cial intelligence, where we basically have to solve real-world vision AI. And we are. So -- andkey to solving this is also having some massive data set. So just having well over 1 million cars onthe road that are collecting data from very sort of corner case rare situations -- sort of like so manyweird things in the world like a truck carrying a truck or a car with -- one example is like a car as anactual example, a car with the kayak on the roof where the kayak has a little weight dangling fromthe front of the kayak in front of the car and -- but yet the car must ignore this and just look at theroad.So it's really quite tricky, but I am highly conï¬?dent that we will get this done. So -- yes. Thisquarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of themost difï¬?cult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and samedifï¬?culties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people haveheard about the chip shortage. This is a huge problem. But then in addition to that, for example, wehad quite a difï¬?culty scaling, driving our production in China because we're unable to get criticalengineers there because of COVID quarantine restrictions. So -- which meant that Tesla worldwidewas dependent on drive units made at our factory in Nevada, Giga Nevada. So that was a verychallenging situation.I think we're mostly out of that particular problem. That's just -- those was just 2 of manychallenges. So the team has really done an incredible job of dealing with really severe supply chainshortages.So with respect to the Model S and X, there were more challenges than expected in developing theModel S or what we call the Palladium program, which is the new version of Model S and X, whichhas revised interior and new battery pack and new drive units and new internal electronics and has,for example, a PlayStation 5 level infotainment system.","Q1 was -- had some of themost difï¬?cult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla.

2021-04-26,"There's just a lot of issues encountered,ensuring that the new factory was, [as also we're saying] was quite hard because we were workingmore energy in a smaller pace. So it took quite a bit of of development to ensure that the battery ofthe new S/X is safe. And we're trying to get all the -- in the cars slowly for the past few months. Butwe're just stacking them up in the yard and just making reï¬?nements to the cars that we built. But wedo expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month. And then tobe in sort of fairly high volume production for the X in Q3 and start delivering Model X in Q3 aswell.So I think as we ramp up, I think probably the demand for the new S/X will be quite high. So it'sreally just going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes. Soprobably, like, we're going to aim to produce over 2,000 S/X per week. Perhaps if we get lucky,upwards of 2,400 or 2,500. This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which is just alot of factors outside of our control here. But I do think [these will get solved], so it's just a matterof time, and then we'll be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week. It's a great car. It actually costs usless to produce, a little bit less to produce, but it is a superior product.So in conclusion is there's a lot to be excited about in 2021 and '22. We're building factories asquickly as we can. Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well, and we expect to have initial limitedproduction from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.At this time, we are continuing to ramp production of Model Y in Fremont and Shanghai. In thebackground, we're continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, the Roadster andother products. Thanks to everyone at Tesla who made this year a huge success. Now on toquestions.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaOkay.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of CoinYes. Thanks, Martin. Thanks, Elon. So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiplerecords in the ï¬?rst quarter of '21, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difï¬?cult of theyear for many reasons.To summarize the quarter, I think it's best understood by 3 key items.","We expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month.

2021-04-26,"First, we successfullylaunched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the ï¬?rstquarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market. Second, as Elon mentioned,although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not yet beguncustomer deliveries. The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningfulheadwind to free cash ï¬?ows and proï¬?t generation.For example, we incurred an estimated $200 million of direct P&L impact relating to this programin Q1, the majority of which is reï¬?ected in COGS and that's before even considering the impact oflost revenue and proï¬?ts as a result of the transition. And as he mentioned -- as Elon mentioned, weexpect the ï¬?rst deliveries to begin shortly.Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly aroundsemiconductors and port capacities, while the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers didtremendous work keeping our factories running, we did experience high expedite costs in thequarter, and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor interruptions toproduction over the course of the quarter. We believe that this landscape is improving, but it doesremain difï¬?cult, and it's an evolving situation.If we double-click within net income. Auto gross margin, excluding credits, improved sequentiallyand year-over-year. This is in spite of the cost mentions for S and X and expedites and a reductionin global ASPs as our cost structure as a company is reducing at an even faster pace. So as we lookout over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly assome of these headwinds we're experiencing start to be resolved.On services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards proï¬?tability, aided bystrength in the used car business, operational improvements in service and additional servicerevenue opportunities that help absorb ï¬?xed overhead.On energy gross margins, these remained negative for second quarter. This is driven by solar-relatedramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease PPA business. We continue to manage through amulti-quarter backlog on Powerwall. We're working as fast as we can to increase production. Andthis will aid in proï¬?tability of this business as those volumes increase.On operating expenses, these increased for Q1, which is driven by our investments in technologyand growth. In particular, for R&D, this includes the structural battery pack and 4680 cells,investments in the new S and X and our neural net and silicon investments.On the SG&A side, we're setting up infrastructure and support for both China and EMEA inanticipation of volume to come there.","The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningfulheadwind to free cash ï¬?ows and proï¬?t generation.

2021-04-26,"And as I said before, our plans show that we remain on trackfor sustained industry-leading operating margins.Double-clicking on cash ï¬?ows. We continue to generate positive free cash ï¬?ows, and this wasdespite the signiï¬?cant working capital headwinds from S and X. Additionally, we are makingprogress reducing various forms of debt. We also invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin during the quarter,then trimmed our position by 10%, which contributed to a small gain in our Q1 ï¬?nancials.Taking a step back, we've generated $8 billion in operating cash ï¬?ows and $4 billion in free cashï¬?ows over the past 4 quarters. As we look forward, our plans remain unchanged for long-termgrowth of 50% annually, and we believe we're on track to exceed that this year as we guided to lastquarter. Global demand remains meaningfully higher than production levels. And so we're drivingas fast as we can to increase our production rates. As we think about Q2 and Q3, these quartersshould largely be driven by execution on S and X, as we've discussed, continued ramp of Model Yin Shanghai and the associated cost reductions of these programs. And we expect proï¬?tability andcash generation to evolve over the course of the year in line with those improvements.And then as we get towards the end of the year, our story will pivot towards the launch and ramp ofour newest factories in Austin and Berlin. So there's certainly no shortage of exciting things for usto work on and look forward to. Thank you, and we'll open it up for questions.Questions and Answers:Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And we'll ï¬?rst take retail questions from, say, website. The ï¬?rst question is,how is Dojo coming along? Could Dojo unlock an AWS like business line for Tesla over the nextfew years?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of CoinYes. I'll jump in here. So with respect to Dojo...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaSorry, Zach. My apologies. I was on mute.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of CoinGo ahead, Elon.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaSo yes, I was just basically saying that the -- although like right now, people think of Tesla as -- alot will think of Tesla as a car company or as an energy company. I think long term, people willthink of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy company.","Our plans remain unchanged for long-termgrowth of 50% annually, and we believe we're on track to exceed that this year as we guided to lastquarter.

2021-04-26,"Ithink we are developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world.Certainly, we appear to be able to use things with full self-driving that others cannot. So if you lookat the evolution of what technologies we developed, we developed them in order to solve theproblem of self-driving. So we couldn't ï¬?nd a powerful enough neural net [in terms of a] computer.So we designed and built our own.The software out there was really quite primitive for this task. And so we built the team fromscratch and have been developing what we think is probably the most advanced real-world AI in theworld. And then it sort makes sense that this is kind of what needs to happen because the roadsystem is designed for a neural net computer, our brain. Our brain is neural net computer. And it's --the entire road system is designed for vision with a neural net computer, which is because it'sdesigned for eyes in the brain. And so if you have a system which has very good eyes, you can seein all directions at once, you can see 3 focal points ahead or forward, but it never gets tired. It'snever sort of texting. It has redundancy and its reaction time is super human. Then it seems prettyobvious that such a system would achieve an extremely high level of safety, far in excess of theaverage person.So that's what we're doing. Then Dojo is kind of the training part of that. So because we're -- wehave over 1 million cars, and perhaps next year, we'll have 2 million cars in active use, providingvast amounts of video training data that then needs to be digested by a very powerful trainingsystem. And currently, we use Tesla training software. So we developed a lot of training software, alot of labeling software to do, to able to do surround video labeling, which is quite tricky. Thismeans all 8 cameras simultaneously at 36 range a second per camera labeling video over time.There wasn't any tool that existed for this, so we developed our own labeling tool.Then taking it a step further, obviously, the Holy Grail is auto labeling. So now we're getting quitegood at auto labeling, where we do -- where -- that the trainers train the training system and then thesystem auto labels the data and then the human laborers just need to look at the labeling to conï¬?rmthat it is correct and perhaps make edits.","The company is developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world.

2021-04-26,"And then every time an edit is made, that further trains thesystem. So it's kind of like a ï¬?ywheel that's just sort of spinning up. And really, the only way to dothis is with vast amounts of video data.So then we need to train this efï¬?ciently. So Dojo is really a -- it is a supercomputer optimized forneural net training. We think Dojo will be, probably in order of magnitude, more efï¬?cient on, say --not sure what the exact right metric is, but say, per frame of video, we think it will be an order ofmagnitude more cost efï¬?cient in hardware and in energy usage for a frame of video compared to aGPU-based solution or compared to the next best solution that we're aware of.So then possibly that could be used by others. It does seem as though over time -- I mean just anobservation, I think basically is the fact that neural net based computing or AI-based computing isand more and more of the compute stack. We -- conventional computing -- well, perhaps heuristics-based computing is still going to be important, still going to be very important, but it will become --but neural net will become a bigger and bigger portion of compute. So a long story, but I think, yes,probably others will want to use it too, and we will make it available.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRLet's go to the second question from retail investors. The recent price changes on solar roof havebeen discouraging for customers and investors. Could just like share more about solar roofchallenges? And if the outlook has changed at all, i.e., 1,000 roofs per week.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaYes. First of all, I should say that the demand for the solar roof remains strong. So despite raisingthe price, the demand is still signiï¬?cantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install thesolar roofs. So production is going ï¬?ne, but we are [curbed] at the installation point. We did ï¬?ndthat we basically made some signiï¬?cant mistakes in assessing the difï¬?culty of certain roofs, but thecomplexity of roofs varies dramatically. Some roofs are to be literally 2 or 3x easier than otherroofs. So you just can't have a one-size-ï¬?ts-all situation. If a roof has a lot of protuberances or if theroof sort of -- the core structure of the roof is rotted out or is it not strong enough to hold the solarroof, then the cost can be double, sometimes 3x what we -- what our initial quotes were.","Dojo is really a -- it is a supercomputer optimized forneural net training.

2021-04-26,"So in thosecases, what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit and -- but what we cannotdo is go and just lose a massive amount of money. We just got to provide a refund of the earlydeposit.But that's what is, I think, most important about the solar roof situation, which I tweeted about thispast week, is that we're shifting the whole sort of solar situation -- the solar power -- well, basically,solar power situation to there's only 1 product basically -- or there's only 1 conï¬?guration. Everyhouse -- we will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall. That solar could either be solar retroï¬?twith conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solarglass Roof. But in all cases, itwill have the power to -- technically, this is -- it's actually Powerwall 2 plus, if you will. The plusrefers to a higher peak power capability.So basically, all Powerwalls made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak powercapability than the speciï¬?cation on the website. They have about twice the power capabilityroughly. It depends on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and about arguablytwice the steady-state power of the speciï¬?cation of the website. The energy is the same, but thepower is roughly double. And all the installations -- so all installations will have a Powerwall. Andthe difï¬?culty installation will dramatically -- or the difï¬?culty of the installation will be much less. Itwill be much easier because the power from the solar roof -- Solarglass Roof or the solar panels willonly ever go directly into the Powerwall. And the Powerwall will only ever go between the utilitymeans -- between the utility and the main power panel of the house, which means you never need totouch the main circuit breakers of the house. You never need to touch the house circuit breakers.Effectively, almost every house, therefore, looks the same electrically instead of being a uniquework of art and requiring exceptional ability to rewire the main panel.So this is extremely important for scalability is. It's the only way to do it, really. And this alsomeans that every solar Powerwall installation that the house, or whatever the case may be, will beits own utility. And so even if all lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power. Sothat gives people energy security.And we can also, in working with the utilities, use the Powerwalls to stabilize the overall grid.","Tesla's Powerwalls have about twice the power capability than the speciï¬?cation on the website.

2021-04-26,"Solet's say that there's a -- like there was in Texas, there was a peak power demand, and the powerdemand, because the grid lacked the ability to buffer the power, they had to shut down power.There's no power storage. No good point on power storage. However, with a whole bunch ofPowerwalls and houses, we can actually buffer the power. And so if the grid needs more power, wecan actually then, with the consent, obviously, of the homeowner and in partnership with the utility,we can then actually release power onto the grid to take care of peak power demand.So effectively, the Powerwalls can operate as a giant distributed utility. This is profound. I'm notsure how many of you will actually understand this but this is extremely profound and necessarybecause we are headed towards a world where, as we were just talking about earlier, where peopleare moving towards electric vehicles. This will mean that the power needs in -- at homes andbusinesses will increase signiï¬?cantly. We will -- there will need to be a bunch more electricitycoming somewhere. In fact, if you go to full renewable electricity, we need about 3x as muchelectricity as we currently have. So these are rough numbers, but roughly you need twice -- roughlyneed twice much electricity if all transport goes electric, and they need 3x much electricity if allheating goes electric. So basically, this is a prosperous future, I think, both for Tesla and for theutilities.Because -- and in fact, I think this will be very -- if this is not done, the utilities will fail to servetheir customers. They won't be able to do it. They won't be able to react fast enough. And we'regoing to see more and more of what we see, say, in California and Texas of people seeingbrownouts and blackouts and the utilities not being able to respond because there's a massivechange going on with the transition to electric transport. And we're seeing more extreme weatherevents. This is a recipe for disaster. So it is very important to have solar and batteries at the locallevel, at the house.In addition, it is important to have large battery storage at the utility level, so that solar and wind,which are the main forms of renewable electricity, can be -- that electricity can be stored becausesometimes the wind doesn't blow, sometimes it blows wide. Sometimes it blows too much andsometimes it didn't blow enough. But if you have a battery, you can store the energy and provide theenergy to the grid as needed.","Tesla CEO: Powerwalls can operate as a giant distributed utility. We are headed towards a world where, as we were just talking about earlier, where peopleare moving towards electric vehicles. This will mean that the power needs in -- at homes andbusinesses will increase signiï¬?cantly. If you go to full renewable electricity, we need about 3x as muchelectricity as we currently have. So basically, this is a prosperous future, I think, both for Tesla and for theutilities, says Elon Musk, CEO of electric car maker Tesla, in an interview with CNN.",0.06980101764202120,0.3006724715232850,0.6295264959335330,Energy Generation and Storage
2021-04-26,"The same goes for solar because, obviously, the sun does not shine atnight and sometimes it is very cloudy. And so by having battery storage paired with solar and wind,this is the long-term solution to a sustainable energy future.And as I said, it needs to occur both at the local level and at the utility level. If it doesn't occur at thelocal level, what will actually be required is a massive increase in power lines in power plants. Sothey have to put long distance and local power lines all over the place.

Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of CoinSure. Thanks, Martin. So as I noted in our opening remarks and we've announced previously, soTesla did invest $1.5 billion into bitcoin in Q1, and then we subsequently sold a 10% stake in that.We also allow customers to make vehicle deposits and ï¬?nal vehicle purchases using bitcoin. And sowhere our Bitcoin story began, maybe just to share a little bit of context here. Elon and I werelooking for a place to store cash that wasn't being immediately used, trying to get some level ofreturn on this, but also preserve liquidity. Particularly as we look forward to the launch of Austinand Berlin and uncertainty that's happening with semiconductors and port capacity, being able toaccess our cash very quickly is super important to us right now. And there aren't many traditionalopportunities to do this or at least that we found and in talking to others that we could get goodfeedback on, particularly with yields being so low and without taking on additional risk orsacriï¬?cing liquidity. And Bitcoin seemed at the time and so far has proven to be a good decision. Agood place to place some of our cash that's not immediately being used for daily operations ormaybe not needed till the end of the year and be able to get some return on that.And I think one of the key points that I want to make about our experiences in the digital currencyspace is that there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic here.","Batteries paired with solar and wind is the long-term solution to a sustainable energy future.

So our ability to build our ï¬?rst position happened quickly. When wedid the sale later in March, we also were able to execute on that very quickly.And so as we think about kind of global liquidity for the business in risk management, being able toget cash in and out of the market is something that I think is exceptionally important for us.

Thank you very much. Let's go to the next question from institutional investors. The ï¬?rstquestion is, proponents of alternative grid storage technologies claim that lithium-ion is unsuited forlong-term storage at scale due to vampire drain. Could 4680 cells address this limitation? Is thelimitation even relevant for charging the energy equation?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Just let me jump in on the vampire drain. That's deï¬?nitely not the issue. Good lithium ion cellself discharges less than 0.001% of its energy per day. So it's -- this vampire drain is maybe notthat...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaI just love they call it vampires.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Yes, I think the challenge with seasonal storage is your value proposition drops from hundredsof useful full cycles per year to less than maybe 10 or maybe even less than 5 cycles per year. So it'sjust a different type of technology altogether that would make sense, given that it's more than anorder of magnitude, different use case.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaYes. We've got a long way to go before we're dealing with seasonal technology issues.","Autosteer did not and could notengage on the road condition that -- as it was designed.

2021-04-26,"But certainlya way to deal with seasonal technology would be to have wind and solar erring on the side of more[sublay] latitude and -- but then across a variety of longitude. So essentially, like let's say, in theU.S., for example, if there was a -- I'm not sure if you'll understand this, you can actually power theentire United States with just sort of 100 -- roughly a 100-mile -- by a 100-mile grid of solar. Somepeople don't quite understand like, well, how much solar is needed to power the United States.Almost nothing of the (inaudible) of almost any country in the world.The solar incident is a gigawatt per square kilometer. This is insane. In fact, you took the clear area,just the area or saying for nuclear power plants, the area that is considered not usable because of anuclear power plant is there, in most cases, if you just put solar there, it would generate more powerthan the nuclear power plant because they typically have pretty wide clear areas. So it really -- so ifyou have, say, 25% efï¬?cient solar panels and then those are 80% efï¬?cient in how they laid out,you're going to do about 200 megawatts per square kilometer. Therefore, [5 straight] kilometers is agigawatt, which might be a typical sort of power plant. It's really not much area at all. And a lot ofplaces can have wind and solar in place.So anyway, it's entirely possible to power all of earth with a small percentage of earth's area. Andthen to transfer that power through high-voltage DC lines with no new technology. No -- you don'tneed like room temperature superconductors. This another room temperature superconductors. Thisis a total -- also another myth. Room temperature superconductors, almost irrelevant, in my opinion,almost irrelevant. Low-cost, long-distance power lines using copper or aluminum is very important.So heating is [ice where are]. So that's current square type of resistance. So as you increase voltage,you can drop the current dramatically and drop the heating dramatically to the point where it is ofminor relevance, like maybe you lose 5% to 7% with a high-voltage DC power line, something likethat.So I want to be clear. (inaudible) no new materials are necessary. We just need to scale this thing up.We -- the technologies exist today to solve renewable energy. And some people will say, well, whydon't we do it? That's because the energy basis of the earth is gigantic, super mega insanelygigantic.","The energy basis of the earth is gigantic, super mega insanelygigantic.

2021-04-26,"So you can't just go and do 1 zillion terawatts overnight. You've got to build theproduction capacity for the cells, for the battery cells, for the solar cells. You've got to put that intovehicles. You've got to put that into (inaudible) storage packs. You've got to put that into solarpanels and Solarglass Roofs, and you've got to deploy all this thing -- all this stuff.But it is certainly the case that we can accelerate this. And we should try to accelerate it. And theright thing to do, I think, from an economic standpoint, and I think an economist to agree is to havea common tax, just as we have a tax on cigarettes and alcohol, which we think are more likely to bebad than good, and we tend to tax fruit and vegetables less. It was the same should be true. Weshould tax energy that we think is probably bad and support energy we think is probably good, justlike cigarettes and alcohol versus fruits and vegetables. This is common sense.And -- but I guess on the plus side, I'm not suggesting anyone be complacent. But sustainableenergy, renewable energy will be sold, it is being sold, but it matters how fast we sold it. And if wesold it faster, that's better for the world. There's no question in my mind whatsoever that the energystorage problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, zero. I want to be clear, zero.I think the bias will tend to be towards iron-based lithium-ion cells. When we say lithium-ion, youwill think lithium must be a big constituent of the cells. It's more like 1% to 2% of the cell islithium. But the main part of the cell is the cathode, the main mass and cost in the cells is thecathode. For high-energy cells, like for example, what we use in most -- most Teslas have nickel-based lithium-ion cells, which have higher energy density, longer range than iron-based cells.However, stationary storage, the energy density is not as important because it's just staying on theground. And so I think the vast majority of stationary storage will be iron-based lithium-ion cellswith an iron phosphate cathode technically. But I think the phosphate part is unnecessary, so is theiron ore nickel. I'm destroying the terminology. Just think of it as iron and nickel. And there's aninsane amount of iron in the world, more iron than we could possible use. And there's also morelithium than we could possibly use.","There's no question in my mind whatsoever that the energystorage problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, zero.

2021-04-26,"Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in ironplus base lithium-ion cells.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. Let's go to the next question from institutional investors, which is yousuggested that between a 5x to 10x improvement is achievable in the automotive production versusthe ï¬?rst Model 3 line on the ï¬?rst principles physics analysis. Where does Berlin sit relative to thatlimit?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaI think we're still quite far away from it. I mean the thing to bear in mind with production is -- forthose who've never done production, they just don't understand how insanely hard production is. Iwant to really be very, very emphatic here. Prototypes are trivial, they're child's play. Production ishard, is very hard. Now you say production at large scale with higher liability and low cost,insanely difï¬?cult. But Tesla achieved on the automotive side was not to create an electric car. Thetruly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the ï¬?rst American car company to achievevolume production of a car in 100 years and not go bankrupt.So this is -- this -- basically, myself and many others at Tesla had to basically have severalaneurysms to get this done. It was so hard to have no idea. So anyway -- and the thing about makinga large complex manufacturing object is, let's say you have ï¬?rst-order approximation, 10,000unique items. And even one of those items is slow, that says you wait, just one. Doesn't matter how-- so trivial. We've had production stop because of carpet in the trunk. We've had production stopbecause of a USB cable. At one point, for Model S, the -- we literally raided every electronics storein the Bay Area. For a few days there, nobody could buy a USB cable in the Bay Area because wewent and bought them all to put them in the car, literally.And there's like hundreds of stories like that. So anyway, that -- solving that -- those constraints anda logistics problem that makes World War II look trivial. I'm not kidding. Like the scale is insane.We're talking millions of cars, massive global supply chain, 50 countries, dozens of regulatoryregimes. It's insane.

2021-04-26,"First question is from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureI'd love to get actually based on what you presented on the Battery Day. In the last 6, 7 months, Iwant -- I was wondering how much progress you've made on that front, ï¬?rst, in terms of processdevelopment. So how are things coming together on your pilot line? Are you getting to the kind ofproduction throughput you were aiming for?And second and actually on your production ramp. So I was wondering in which sites you'reramping production capacity for the 4680 cell and where you stand on ramping up that capacity aswell. And I have a quick follow-up on energy as well if that's possible.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaWell, so we have the -- and Drew can add to this. But we have the -- a small sort of pilot plant,which is still big by normal standards, expected to have like a 10-gigawatt hour per year capabilityin Fremont, California. And we made quite a few cells. We're not quite yet at the point where wethink the cells are reliable enough to be shipped in cars, but we're getting close to that point. Andthen we've already ordered most of the equipment for battery production in Berlin and then much ofit for Austin as well. So we really don't ï¬?ick the nitty-gritty elements. But overall, I think we stillfeel quite optimistic about this achieving volume production of the 4680 next year. What do youthink?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, thanks. Just one thing I would add is there's been a lot of questions about yields. Actually, Inoticed people asking about that. The yield progress has been really strong every day, and we werereally still in commissioning phase. We were really still in commissioning phase with most of thetools to the point where we're conï¬?dent that the yield trajectory aligns with our internal costprojections. We did talk about yield also at Battery Day, which is one of the reasons why it's usefulto check in on that. It takes a while, as Elon just mentioned, to go from prototype to production.And it's not just parts. It's processes, it's equipment. But as we've matured the process equipment,we've gotten to where we need to be on the yield side.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc.","Elon R.

If you look at the size of our ï¬?eet and you look at the number of customers who didnot purchase FSD upfront or on a lease and maybe want to experiment with FSD, this is a greatoption for them.One of the things we'll need to keep an eye on is a potential transition from cash purchases of FSDsubscription over to -- or cash purchases of FSD who may move over to FSD subscription. And sothere could be a period of time in which cash reduces in the near term and then as the portfolio ofsubscription customers builds up, then that becomes a pretty strong business for us over time.

And so we're making investments there ahead of the growth.And overall, as we looked at OpEx as a percentage of revenue over the course of the year, we doexpect to see a substantial drop from 2020 to 2021 as the volumes in the latter part of the year pickup.","We're also getting very heavy into 4680 development that Drew and team are working on and theassociated battery pack that goes along with that. So these are new technologies, notonly new to Tesla, but new to the industry. And so we're investing heavily there on an R&D side towork out those kinks. And spend along in those areas should continue over time as we continue towork through the development cycle of those. On the SG&A side, the business is pivoting very quickly to be global.

2021-04-26,"From Dan Levy from Cr???©dit Suisse.Dan Meir Levy - Cr??©dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystTwo questions. One is on COGS. I think we've gotten from Battery Day a pretty good feel about thepotential for COGS reduction related to powertrain. But I'd like to get a sense of the path toreducing COGS, ex powertrain, as you'd still need a meaningful reduction on that front to make themath work on a $25,000 vehicle. So what levers do you have to reducing your cost, ex powertrain?Is it just more scale, better supplier pricing? Or is it just based on ongoing cost reduction?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaI mean I think all of the above.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, I mean on the vehicle side, there's plenty of opportunity as well. Obviously, building a car likea Model S lot is quite complex and has various moving parts. Model 3 and Model Y were steps ofimprovement in that. But when you look at some of the other advancements that we're including inthe Model Y , factories into Austin and Berlin, we've reduced the body count by as much as 60%,and the park cost money. So we continue to ï¬?nd optimizations there as well as we get theeconomies of scale when we start to talk about the volumes we're considering worldwide with 4factories building the same vehicle. So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve ourCOGS as well, and powertrain continues to be integrated into that.Dan Meir Levy - Cr??©dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystGreat. And then just related. As you see Berlin and Austin ramp, I'd like to just get a sense on thecomparison of Fremont versus the new capacity. Obviously, Fremont non-optimized because youbought the old NUMMI facility. You had to retroï¬?t that to your need. So maybe you can give us asense of how your new capacity is going to differ versus Fremont, what are the areas that you haveefï¬?ciencies that you previously didn't have and maybe how much does that add up to improvedCOGS over time to help you achieve that $25,000 vehicle.Elon R.

2021-07-26,"But before we jump into Q&A, Elon hassome opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSure. So to recap, Q2 2021 was a record quarter on many levels. We achieved record production,deliveries and surpassed over $1 billion in GAAP net income for the ï¬?rst time in Tesla history. I'dreally like to congratulate everyone at Tesla for an amazing job. This is really an incrediblemilestone.It also seems that public sentiment towards EVs is at an inï¬?ection point; and at this point, I thinkalmost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward. Regarding supply chain,while we're making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious. Forthe rest of this year, our growth rates will be determined by the slowest part in our supply chain,which is there's a wide range of chips that are, at various times, the slowest parts in the supplychain.I mean it's worth noting that if we had -- everything else, if we had vast numbers of vehiclesthemselves, we would not be able to make them -- if everything, except the chips, we wouldn't beable to make them. The chip supply is fundamentally the governing factor on our output. It isdifï¬?cult for us to see how long this will last because we don't have -- this is out of our controlessentially. It does seem like it's getting better, but it's hard to predict.So in fact, even achieving the output that we did achieve was only due to an immense effort frompeople within Tesla. We were able to substitute alternative chips and then write the ï¬?rmware in amatter of weeks. It's not just a matter of swapping out a chip. You also have to rewrite the software.So it was an incredibly intense effort of ï¬?nding new chips, writing new ï¬?rmware, integrating with the vehicle and testing in order to maintain production.And I'd also like to thank our suppliers who worked with us. And there have been many calls atmidnight, 1 a.m., just with suppliers but -- in resolving a lot of the shortages. So thanks very muchto our suppliers.Let's see. In terms of FSD subscription, we were able to launch full self-driving subscription lastmonth. And we expect it to build slowly and then -- but then gather a lot of momentum over time.Obviously, we need to have the full-self driving build widely available for it really to take off at ahigh rate and make a lot of progress there.","Q2 2021 was a record quarter on many levels.

2021-07-26,"So yes, I think FSD subscription will be a signiï¬?cantfactor probably next year.With regard to Giga Texas and Giga Berlin, we're actually doing this earnings call from Giga Texas,so we're in the factory right now doing this earnings call. And the team has made incredibleprogress here. You can see the pictures online and see that there's basically nothing a year ago andthis -- a large -- a mostly complete large factory a year later. So it's really great work by the GigaTexas team. And then also great work in Berlin, Brandenburg with the team there.So we expect to be producing the sort of new design of the Model Y in both factories in limitedproduction later this year. It's always like it's not -- it's hard to sort of explain to people who havenot been through the agony of a manufacturing ramp. Like why can't you just turn it on and make5,000 a week? This is -- it is so hard to do manufacturing. It is so hard to do production. At grossapproximation, there are 10,000 unique parts and processes that have to work. And the greatergrowth of production goes as fast as the least lucky and dumbest of those 10,000 things. And abunch of them are not even in our control, so it's like -- it's insanely difï¬?cult.I'm fond of saying that prototypes are easy and production is hard. And arguably, the reallyremarkable thing that Tesla's done is not to make an electric car or to be a car start-up because therehave been hundreds of car start-ups in the United States and outside United States. So the thingthat's remarkable is that Tesla didn't go bankrupt in reaching volume production. That's the amazingpart because everyone else did, because they all got the prototype before the idea was the hard partand it is not. It is trivial by comparison with actual production.So it's always worth noting that of all the American car companies, there are only 2 that have notgone bankrupt and that is Ford and Tesla. So the seeds of defeat are sown on the day of victory, andwe must be careful that we do not do that. So often, if you look at history, so often, the seeds ofdefeat are sown on the day of victory. We will endeavor not to make that the case of Tesla.So let's see, the model lines in Texas -- and mainly in Texas and Berlin will be -- will look verymuch like the Model Ys we currently make, but there are substantial improvements in the difï¬?cultyof manufacturing.","FSD subscription will be a signiï¬?cantfactor probably next year.

2021-07-26,"So for example, the Model Y made here and in Berlin will have a cast front bodyand a cast rear body, whereas the one in California has a cast rear body but not a cast front body.We're also aiming to do a structural pack with 4680s cells, which is a mass reduction and a costreduction.But we're not counting on that as the only way to make things work. We have some backup planwith nonstructural -- with a nonstructural pack and 2170s essentially. So -- but at scale production,we obviously want to be using 4680s and a structural pack. From a physics standpoint, this is thebest architecture; and from an economic standpoint, it is the lowest cost way to go. So the lightest,lowest cost.But there's a lot of new technology there, so it is difï¬?cult to predict with precision when does itwork and when do you reach scale production. And Drew's going to talk a bit more about the 4680production. Yes.So we're all making great progress on the 4680 cells, but there is a tremendous amount ofinnovation that we're packing into that 4680 cell. And so it's not simply a sort of minorimprovement on state of the art. There are -- and we went through this on the Battery Cell Day --really dozens of -- half a dozen major improvements and dozens of small improvements. So I thinkit will be great, but it's difï¬?cult to say when the last of the technical challenges will be solved.So in conclusion, our team continues to make huge efforts to make our factories run at full speed,which is very difï¬?cult. We have had some factory shutdowns due to part shortages, and we hopethose will be relieved in the coming weeks and months. And we're making great progress on fullself-driving. Some of the progress is not easy to see because it is at a foundational software level,and so then it ends up being sort of a 2 steps forward, 1 step back situation. And -- but over time,you do 2 steps forward and 1 step back and keep going, you do move forward.So I'm highly conï¬?dent that the cars will be capable of full self-driving. If they have a full self-driving computer and the cameras, I'm conï¬?dent that they will be able to drive themselves with thesafety level substantially greater than that of the average cars.Once again, thanks to all of our employees who are making this a breakthrough year for Tesla andan incredible quarter.","We're also aiming to do a structural pack with 4680s cells, which is a mass reduction and a costreduction.

2021-07-26,"Thanks, guys.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And we have some follow-up remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin, and thanks, Elon. Just to reiterate, Q2 was a great quarter for the Tesla teamwith strong improvements across the business. In particular, auto gross proï¬?t and margin, excludingcredit, increased substantially. This was primarily driven by better cost optimization across ourfactories, good execution against our cost reduction plans as well as increases in production anddelivery volumes.There was some beneï¬?t from pricing action mostly in North America. However, it was small in thecontext of the other contributors. Note that the Model S and X program was at a slight loss for thequarter due to the relatively low volume. And supply chain challenges, including expedites,continue to provide cost headwinds.Additionally, it's encouraging to see the progress made on proï¬?tability within our energy andservices and other businesses. While there's some beneï¬?t to looking at our progress quarter-over-quarter, I ï¬?nd it more helpful to look at progress over a slightly long-term horizon. Over the last 2years, our vehicle delivery volumes have more than doubled. This volume increase was madepossible by a steady decrease in ASPs of more than 10%, driven by our road map to increaseaffordability and shifting mix towards our more affordable vehicles. Yet over that same period oftime, our auto gross margin, excluding credit, has increased nearly 10 percentage points to ourhighest yet since the introduction of Model 3. This is only possible because our average cost pervehicle has reduced by more than the reduction in average price. This is a remarkable achievementin the context of the volume growth and ASP reduction, as mentioned, and a testament to the hardwork by the Tesla team.Additionally, OpEx as a percentage of revenue has declined and in particular, SG&A, representingthe work we've done to become more efï¬?cient as we scale the company while still making therequired R&D investments to support our future. As a result, our GAAP operating margins haverisen from negative to double digit in line with what we have guided. By managing our overheadcosts and driving higher volumes, our P&L is beneï¬?ting from the marginal proï¬?tability of eachincremental unit, or said differently, we are recognizing the beneï¬?ts of scale and improved ï¬?xedcost absorption.With strong operating cash ï¬?ows and cash balance, we are putting that cash to use. CapEx continuesto tick up, primarily driven by capacity investments in Austin, Berlin and Shanghai.","Q2 was a great quarter for the Tesla team with strong improvements across the business.

2021-07-26,"Additionally,each quarter, we are using our cash to retire legacy debt, which was taken on at a time when interestrates and company risks were much higher than in today's environment.As I've mentioned before, our 2021 volumes will skew towards the second half of the year as wepush for continued sequential increases in volume. Despite the great work so far managing theinstability of the supply chain, these challenges remain and are unfortunately increasing in painwith the higher volume. As we work through the uncertainty, we want to ensure we do our best tomanage customer wait times as well as the impact these interruptions have on our employees andcosts.And as Elon mentioned, volume growth will be determined by part availability as we have thefactory capacity ready and are in a strong demand position.

And now let's go through the retail investor questions onsay.com.Questions and Answers:Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThe ï¬?rst question from Robert M. is Tesla's website still says Cybertruck production is expected tobegin in late 2021. Can Tesla share more details on the current status of the Cybertruck and conï¬?rmif production is still (technical difï¬?culty) Lars, do you want to...Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringSorry, we cut out there for a second. Yes, the Cybertruck is currently in its alpha stages. We ï¬?nishedthe basic engineering, architecture of the vehicle. With the Cybertruck, we're redeï¬?ning how thevehicle is being made. As Elon said, it carries much of the structural pack and large casting designsof the Model Y being built in Berlin and Austin. Obviously, those take priority over the Cybertruck,but we are moving into the beta phases of Cybertruck later this year, and we'll be looking to rampthat in production in Giga Texas after Model Y is up and going.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, just worth reemphasizing that the extraordinarily difï¬?cult -- extraordinary difï¬?culty of rampingproduction of large manufacturing items. The risk of being repetitive, it's actually easy to makeprototypes or sort of handle small volume production. But anything produced at high volume,which is really what's relevant here, is it's going to move as fast as the slowest of the, say, at roughorder of magnitude, 10,000 unique parts and processes.And so you can have 9,999, which is 1 is missing.","As I've mentioned before, our 2021 volumes will skew towards the second half of the year as wepush for continued sequential increases in volume.

2021-07-26,"I mean we were missing -- for example, like abig struggle this quarter was the module that controls the airbags and the seatbelts. And obviously,you cannot ship a car without those. And that limited our production severely worldwide inShanghai and in Fremont. So it -- like it wouldn't have mattered if we had like 17 different carmodels because they won't need the airbag module, so it's irrelevant.So the -- in order for Cybertruck and Semi to scale to volume that's meaningful for customerdeliveries, we've got to solve the chip shortage or working with our suppliers and people just wantto say, ""Why don't you just build a chip fab?"" Okay, well, okay, that would take us, even movinglike lightning, 12 to 18 months. So it's not like you can just whip out a chip fab, just like, yes, I'lljust make a quick chip fab.So some of these things are -- yes, anyway. It is quite a trial dealing with all of the constraints ofscaling a large manufactured object. I think it may be the case that Tesla is scaling. It's -- I think wemight be the fastest in history ever for scaling a large manufactured object. I think maybe the ModelT would have been comparable back in the day, the Ford Model T. Probably, the Internet knows theanswer. But I think we may be scaling large manufactured object at the fastest rate in history. Or I'dlike to know who did it faster, so we can learn from them. So it's worth just noting that, and in thegrand scheme of things, it's not bad.So yes, so Cybertruck and Semi, actually both are heavy users of cell capacity. So we've got tomake sure we have the cell capacity for those 2 vehicles or it's kind of pointless. We can make asmall number of vehicles, but the effective cost if you make a small number of vehicles is the same.Like they literally cost like $1 million a piece or more. There's a reason why you do things atvolume production, which is to get the economies of scale that get us down.So we are looking at a pretty massive increase in cell availability next year, but it's not like inJanuary 1. It comes through -- it ramps up through the course of next year. But even without Tesla --Tesla's (technical difï¬?culty) Hello? Okay. Even without Tesla cell production, we believe oursuppliers will be able to deliver about twice as much cell output in next year as this year.","Cybertruck and Semi, actually both are heavy users of cell capacity.

2021-07-26,"And Drew,do you want to talk more about that?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, given concerns over cells bottlenecking growth, our target is to grow cell supply ahead of the50% year-on-year growth targets of the vehicle business and also enable increased energy storagedeployments. So yes, our cell suppliers are tracking to double their production in 2022.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. It's worth thing like if you have a target of a certain number, that doesn't mean it happens likeas sure as night follows day. It's a target. So if there is some calamity in the world that it drops thesupply chain, then it will be less. But the contracts that we have with cell suppliers quote roughly adoubling of cell supply to Tesla in 2022.And we have to juggle these exponential -- there's a whole bunch of exponential graphs sort ofoverlay on top of each other, and small changes in where you are on the X axis of time can quitesubstantially change the area under the curve. So what we're thinking of doing is like depending on-- it's basically overshooting on cell supply for vehicles, and then as we have, say, excess cellsupply in 1 month or another, then routing that cell output to the Megapack and Powerwall. Oh bythe -- if we're -- prior to [taking] vehicle production, if there's a shortage of cell output, for somereason, then we will throttle down Megapack and Powerwall production.

2021-07-26,"Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringWhich has more ï¬?ow to it.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. As mentioned, things will move as fast as the slowest part of the entire supply chain,which goes all the way back to raw materials, lithium and nickel and that kind of thing. And there'ssometimes perception that Tesla uses a lot of cobalt, but we actually don't. Apple uses, I think,almost 100% cobalt in their batteries in cellphones, laptops. But Tesla uses no cobalt in the ironphosphate packs and almost none in the nickel-based chemistries. So on a weighted average basis,we might use 2% cobalt compared to the Apple's 100% cobalt.Anyway, so it's just -- it's really just not a fact. We expect to basically have 0 cobalt in the future. SoI do -- maybe with -- I think probably there is a long-term shift more in the direction of iron-basedlithium-ion cells over nickel. As the energy density of sort of iron ore or the iron phosphate -- mightas well just call it iron. The phosphate is taken for granted. But iron-based cells, lithium-ion cellsand nickel-based lithium-ion cells, I think probably we'll see a shift. My guess is probably to 2/3iron, 1/3 nickel or something on that order.And this is actually good because there's plenty of iron in the world. There's an insane amount ofiron. But nickel is -- there's much less nickel, and there's way less cobalt. So it is good for relievingthe long-term scaling to move to iron-based cells mostly. And I think long term, possibly all --there's a good chance that all stationary storage, that is Powerwall and Megapack, moves iron,which is most likely the case since you do not need to transport it and there's [less volume thatmatch] constraint for stationary storage. So then nickel would be for -- really for long-range roadtransport, ships and aircraft, that kind of thing.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. Let's go to the second question from retail, which is Elon has said that Tesla will beopening up the Supercharger network to other EVs later this year. Can you share some more detailson how this will be structured? Will this be at select brands? Or will they contribute to the growthof this network?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. We're currently thinking it's a real simple thing where you just download the Tesla app and yougo to a Supercharger, and you just indicate which stall you're in.","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. As mentioned, things will move as fast as the slowest part of the entire supply chain. And there'ssometimes perception that Tesla uses a lot of cobalt, but we actually don't. SoI do -- maybe with -- I think probably there is a long-term shift more in the direction of iron-basedlithium-ion cells over nickel.

2021-07-26,"So you plug in your car even if it'snot Tesla, and then you just access the app and say turn on this stall that I'm in for how muchelectricity. And this should basically work with, I think, almost any manufacturer's cars.There will be a time constraint. So if the charge rate is super slow, then somebody will be chargedmore because the biggest constraint at the Superchargers is time, how occupied is the stall. Andwe'll also be smarter with how we charge for electricity at the Superchargers. So rush hour chargingwill be more expensive than off hours charging because there are times when the Superchargers areempty and times when they're jampacked. And so it makes sense to have some time-baseddiscrimination.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. We've been doing that, and it's been working and people respond. It helps with utilization.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. So yes, I think we're -- in Europe and China and most parts of the world, it's the sameconnector for everyone. So this is a fairly easy thing to do, develop our own connector, which, inmy opinion, is actually the best connector. It's small and light, looks good, so standard. So wedeveloped our own connector, which in my opinion, is actually the best connector. It's small andlight, looks good.So an adapter is needed to work for EVs in North America. But people could buy this adapter, andwe anticipate having it available at the Superchargers as well if people don't sort of steal them orsomething.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringWe have a good solution for that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorOkay. So -- but that is -- that's a constraint on North America thing. That's basically a vestige ofhistory.

It is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors,which is sometimes used by some companies.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringI think it's also important to comment that increasing the utilization of the network actually reducesour costs, which allows us to lower charging prices for all customers, makes the network moreproï¬?table, allows us to grow the network faster.","Elon R.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Obviously, in order for this to be -- for the Supercharger to be useful to other powercompanies, Lars, we need to grow the network faster than we're growing vehicle output, which isnot easy. We're growing vehicle output at a hell of a rate. So Superchargers need to grow faster thanvehicle output, so this is a lot of work for the Supercharger team. But it is only useful in the grandscheme of things. It's only useful to the public if we're able to grow faster than Tesla vehicle output.So that is our goal.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And the third question is Elon said 4680 cells aren't reliable enough forvehicles. Is this referring to cycle life degradation or something else? Please update us on progressof 4680s? And what still needs to be done to make them reliable enough for vehicles?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, really, this is about -- we'll deï¬?nitely make the 4680 reliable enough for vehicles. Andwe, I think, are at the point where, in limited volume, it is reliable enough for vehicles. The -- again,going back to like limited production is easier. Prototype production is easy, but high-volumeproduction is hard. There are a number of challenges in transitioning from small-scale production toa large-volume production.And not to get too much into the weeds of things, but right now, we have a challenge with basicallythe, what's called calendaring or basically squashing the cathode material to a particular height. Soit just goes through these welders and get squashed like pizza dough basically and -- but very hardpizza dough. And the -- it's causing -- it's denting the calendar rolls. This is not something thathappened when the calendar rolls were smaller, but it is happening when the calendar rolls arebigger. So just like -- we're like, okay, weren't expecting that.Andrew D.

2021-07-26,"Next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureI have another question actually on batteries but on a slightly different angle. I was wondering howyou're looking at your sourcing strategy for the 4680. You've talked a lot about all the work you'redoing to develop your in-house production. But what about asking other battery manufacturers todo 4680 cells with their own technology, maybe less innovation than what you guys are lining upinternally? And I was wondering if the ï¬?rst 4680 cells that we'll see on the road will deï¬?nitely comefrom Tesla's own manufacturing lines or whether they could be coming actually from outsidesuppliers as well. And I have a quick follow-up.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. We are, in fact, working with our existing suppliers to produce 4680 format cells. And this isjust a guess right now, but I see us sort of like consolidating around 4680 nickel-based structuralpack and for long-range vehicles. And then not necessarily a 4680 format but some other format foriron-based cells. And so we -- right now, we kind of have the Baskin-Robbins of batteries situationwith us. We have so many formats and so many chemistries that it's like we've got like 36 ï¬?avors ofbattery this way.This is just -- this results in an engineering drag coefï¬?cient where each variant of cell chemistry andformat requires a certain amount of engineering to maintain it and troubleshoot, and this inhibits ourforward progress. So it is going to be important to consolidate to just maybe ideally 2 form factors,maybe 3 but ideally 2 and then just 1 nickel chemistry and 1 iron chemistry and -- so we don't haveto troubleshoot so many different variants.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. And towards that end, we are engaging with the suppliers that we've had good partnershipswith on 4680 designs to enable that simpliï¬?cation, and so far, so good. They're working on --they're bringing their core competencies to bear on that. We're not mandating like what's going oninside, but it's been a good collaboration.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. And we do expect to see signiï¬?cant increases in supply from our existing suppliers in additionto the cells that Tesla's making. So it's both. Sometimes I get questions from our cell suppliers oflike are we just going to make all the cells ourselves and we're like no.","Elon R.

2021-07-26,"Please make as many as youpossibly can and supply them to us. We have a signiï¬?cant unmet demand in stationary storage.Megapack is basically sold out until the end of next year, I believe. We have a massive backlog inPowerwall demand. The demand of Powerwall versus production is an insane mismatch. Now partof that problem is also the semiconductor issue. So we use a lot of the same chips in the Powerwallas you do in a car. So it's like which one do you want to make? Cars or Powerwalls? So we need tomake cars, so therefore, Powerwall production has been reduced.But as that semiconductor shortage is alleviated, then we can massively ramp up Powerwallproduction. I think we have a chance of hitting an annualized rate of 1 million units of Powerwallnext year maybe towards -- on the order of 20,000 a week but again, dependent on cell supply andsemiconductors.But in terms of demand, I think there's probably demand for in excess of 1 million Powerwalls peryear and actually -- and just a vast amount of Megapacks for utilities. As the world transitions to asustainable energy production, solar and wind are intermittent and, by their nature, really needbattery packs in order to provide a steady ï¬?ow of electricity. And when you look at all of theutilities in the world, this is a vast amount of batteries that are needed. That's why long term, wereally think sort of, combined, Tesla and suppliers need to produce at least 1,000 gigawatt hours ayear and maybe 2,000 gigawatt hours a year.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOkay. Great. And I have a quick question. I know, Elon, you don't think it's meaningful today, butI'd be curious to know if you have any stats about when you announced the new pricing on the FSDmoving from $10,000 from -- to $199 with the lock-in. I'd be curious to understand how it affectedbehavior and if you saw like a massive uptake in the service. And I'm not thinking about peoplelooking at it as an FSD but more to try the most advanced version of autopilot and to try it. So inthe ï¬?rst days, you've announced the pricing. Have you seen like a very signiï¬?cant spike in the takerate? And can you give us a sense of how big it was?Elon R.

Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. This is Zach here. I mean I think we're still early in understanding how FSD subscription willunfold, but a couple of data points here. So we took a look at our backlog to see, of customers inour backlog who have ordered FSD, did they cancel presumably to go to subscription after theytake delivery.

Our Q3 results wereannounced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as thiswebcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ï¬?lings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)But before we jump into the Q&A, Zach has some opening remarks. Zach?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. We're continuing to make great progress as a company, setting new records oneach of the most important ï¬?nancial metrics for Q3. Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars,20% higher than last quarter and 70% higher than the same quarter last year. We were also able toachieve an annualized production run rate of over 1 million cars towards the end of the quarter.The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at ourShanghai factory. Additionally, we have made great progress increasing production volumes ofModel S and have recently started the ramp and deliveries of Model X. It will take a bit more timeto get this program back to prior volumes, but based on demand, we are targeting to exceedhistorical production levels. We have also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as ourmain export hub. This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and tointroduce Model Y to Europe.Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at fullcapacity. It's important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this hasbeen exceptionally difï¬?cult to achieve. I want to thank our supply chain team for their incrediblework and our production teams for showing impressive ï¬?exibility as we make adjustments real-time. This team's expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference whenmanaging through these challenges. Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast withour suppliers as we're adding capacity as quickly as possible. I also want to thank our suppliers fortheir dedication and partnership to Tesla.Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing togrow and average customer wait times are extending.","Our Q3 results wereannounced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.

2021-10-20,"The only practical way to address this in theimmediate term is to do everything we can to build more cars on our existing production lines,which is where we are focused. Similar dynamics are also playing out on our storage business as we are working to expandPowerwall and Megapack production as quickly as parts and cells allow us to do so. Additionally,we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program, and we're excited tohave expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.Financially, our auto gross margins reached 30.5% on a GAAP basis and just under 29% excludingregulatory credits, which is our strongest yet. This beneï¬?t primarily comes from higher volumesparticularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the Model Y as we -- and we have madegood progress increasing Model S volumes. The Model S has now returned to positive grossmargin, and we expect this to increase with higher production and the ramp of Model X.As was the case in Q2, there was some net beneï¬?t from pricing actions. However, this remainssmall in the context of other contributors. Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take timefor the impact of recent changes to ï¬?ow through our ï¬?nancials. Note that we are also not yetrecognizing additional revenue from the FSD beta program. Supply chain challenges, includingexpedites, continue to provide cost headwinds as was also the case with FX this quarter. While weare seeing an impact from the rise in commodity and labor costs, we have also been adjustingpricing, which should help to compensate.Overall, as I mentioned in our last call, our P&L continues to beneï¬?t from the marginal proï¬?tabilityof each incremental unit with higher ï¬?xed cost absorption. As a result of the great progress onmargins, volume and appropriate management of overhead costs, we were able to achieve anoperating margin of just under 15%, exceeding the long-term guidance we've laid out previously.On cash, we generated record operating cash ï¬?ows of $3.1 billion and continue to invest heavily inthe build-out of manufacturing, supercharging and service capacity. We also continue to retire high-interest-rate debt, including the early settlement of our 2025 senior notes of $1.8 billion during thequarter.As we look forward, we are clearly quite a bit ahead of the pacing required to achieve our targetannual growth rate of 50% this year.

2021-10-20,"The next question from a retail shareholder is, what is Tesla's goal forvehicle production capacity for the 4 current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin, by2024?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of 50% per year.And so you can extrapolate that out. There may be some periods of time in which we're well aheadof that. There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we're slightly lower thanthat. But that remains the long-term goal of the company.In Fremont, we're continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible there. Over the last 12months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production. And based upon everything that we know inthe factory, where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we're targeting to increase that another50%. I think that will be a difï¬?cult goal but that's the goal that the internal team has, and they'regoing to continue to push on that.As we look towards Shanghai, we're continuing to push the boundaries there and we continue toramp production there as well, so most recently the ramp-up of the Model Y , which was our biggestcontributor of volume in Q3. We'll continue to ramp that factory. And our plans there with time areto keep growing the capacity in that factory.Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our ï¬?rst iterations of capacity there are on ModelY , but we've intentionally set these factories in locations in which they have a quite signiï¬?cantamount of land and ability to expand. And so we'll take Model Y at these factories. We're trying toget to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can. And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentiallyeven getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories.

2021-10-20,"Great.  The next question is, what is your view on the tightening regulatoryenvironment for FSD, the investigation and broad data request by NHTSA? Some of the recentnominees to NHTSA have been publicly critical of FSD, including engaging with short sellersonline. How will you manage this environment?Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringThanks, Martin. Yes. As we have been for years, we always engage with NHTSA and otherworldwide regulatory bodies to share our knowledge and to work with them on our approaches onboth active and passive safety. There are ongoing regulatory inquiries taking place all the time andespecially on the subjects like FSD that are at the cutting edge of technology development. Duringthese investigations, my team, myself are always cooperative as much as possible. We expect andembrace the scrutiny of these products and know that the truth about their performance and theinnovations our products have will ultimately be all that matters.In the end and as I've said on previous calls, we take safety as a top priority in all our designs. Thisis because our primary motivation is from -- coming from a team of incredible engineers designingsoftware and hardware that saves lives and prevents injuries. In doing so, we'll continue to betransparent to the public on how our technology is both developing from an Autopilot safety data,the latest of which we just shared in the shareholder update, and you can also see and review a widevariety of customer post FSD videos on social media.

2021-10-20,"The next question is, service remains an issue with appointments availableweeks or even months out. Likewise, Supercharger wait times have become untenable at somelocations. What concrete steps is Tesla taking to improve the customer experience in these 2 keyareas?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. I'll take the service part of this question. Drew, you can take the supercharging part. We haveseen an increase in service wait times throughout the summer. And there's a couple of things thathave contributed to that based upon the information that we have. The ï¬?rst is that -- and I think thisis kind of not -- this is not unique to us, is that the return to some sense of normalcy in a post-pandemic world has happened, I think, more quickly than most people expected. And what we'reseeing here is that the number of miles that people are driving has increased. There may have beensome demand for service during 2020 or in the early parts of 2021 that customers put off, and sothere's a bit of a catch-up that's occurring. That has increased demand for service. At the same time,in the macro environment here, logistics, moving parts, sourcing parts has become increasinglymore difï¬?cult, which is a well-known issue in the world right now, as well as challenges in the labormarket.And so this kind of the simultaneous increase in demand for service with the ability to supply thatservice has been impacted for the reasons I mentioned. And so we saw an uptick primarily inEurope and North America in service wait times over the course of the summer. And we've beenworking extremely hard since then to address this, and we've seen our wait times come down. Sothis is not the case in every location, but if you think about it from regional average perspective, weare seeing improvements there.We remain super-focused on adding locations. And so over the last year, we've grown our physicalfootprint of service centers by 35%. We've grown our footprint of mobile repair by over 40%. We'realso adding stafï¬?ng as quickly as we can in the areas that are most impacted by the imbalance ofsupply and demand for service.But I think the most important part about all of this is -- and we've said this on calls before, wherethe best service is no service. And so we have been incredibly focused as a company both on theinitial quality of our vehicles and reliability of our vehicles.","Service remains an issue with appointments availableweeks or even months out.

2021-10-20,"Great, thank you. And maybe last question from shareholders is, how does FSD take rate -- how hasFSD take rate changed since the introduction of monthly subscription? Are there any plans toincrease FSD pricing as wider release becomes imminent?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOI'll take the second part of the question ï¬?rst. We won't be providing any kind of forward-lookingcommentary on our pricing strategy or what may happen here over the near term. With respect tothe ï¬?rst part of the question, it has been an interesting thing for us to unpack within the company. Imean what I'll say just as a general statement before I make a couple of speciï¬?c comments is thatthe things that we learn on FSD subscription today are not necessarily all that relevant. This isreally more of a platform for when FSD beta goes into wide release and the features andfunctionality become more accessible to more customers.The second thing that I'll note is that if you look at the pricing, the monthly pricing of FSDsubscription, and then you compare that to the cost of either rolling FSD option into your lease oryour loan, on a monthly basis, the most economical way for a customer to enjoy the features of fullself-driving is through purchasing it upfront and rolling it through their ï¬?nancing. And as a result ofthat, what we've seen in the data is not -- we're unable to detect a change in the upfront take rate ofFSD when people purchase cars. We have seen quite a bit of activity of folks curious to experiencewhat the software has to offer and subscribing to it and enjoying it through that route. But again, asI said at the beginning, I think what we've seen so far on FSD subscription is not terribly relevant.We'll see how that plays out in the future as we continue to release more features.","Zachary J.

What's the timing?How fast is that business line likely to grow in the next few years?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thank you, Pierre. I'm extremely passionate about our insurance product. We have a terriï¬?cteam here at Tesla of folks who have been spending a lot of time developing this and probablylistening to the call. So we're pretty excited so far, Pierre.So I mean at the highest level here, we entered the insurance market kind of unintentionally, Iwould say. Our customers were coming to us, complaining that the price of traditional insurancewas too high and it was reducing the affordability of a Tesla. And part of our journey here at Teslais we want as many people as possible to be able to afford our products. That's extremely importantto achieving the mission of the company. And if you look at the price of insurance as a percentageof what somebody's monthly payment is, it's quite high. And we spend extreme amounts of effort inmanufacturing to take $5 of BOM cost out here or $10 out somewhere else. If we can get $5, $10,$20, $30 out on a monthly payment, you can calculate what that means in terms of reduction of theprice of the car if you ï¬?nance it, and the leverage of improving insurance cost is huge in terms ofaffordability.And so that's kind of the context by which we stepped into this. As we started to do more research,essentially, the tools by which the insurance is traditionally calculated are optimized based upon theexisting data, but the existing data is limited.","Zachary J.

2021-10-20,"So they -- there's a focus on things like marital statusor age or other attributes like that. Accident history is a good one, et cetera. But what essentiallyhappens here is customers who are low risk and don't actually ï¬?le many claims end up overpayingon their insurance relative to their cost. That overpayment then goes to riskier customers who areessentially being subsidized. And as we looked at this and we looked at the data, we thought thisjust doesn't seem like it's fair.At Tesla, because our cars are connected, because they are essentially computers on wheels, there'senormous amounts of data that we have available to us to be able to assess the attributes of a driverwho's operating that car and whether those attributes correlate with safety because we do get asignal when a car has been in an accident. So we've been spending our time looking at hundreds ofdifferent variables and also looking at billions of miles of driving history. And we've been able to ï¬?ta model that is able to predict, with decent accuracy, the probability of collision over a period oftime.And the model is not perfect, right? The model is a function of the data that we have available. Thatdata set continues to grow. We continue to experiment with new variables, but we do have a modelthat works pretty well so far. And from that model, being able to predict frequency of collision, wecan then align that against the price curve. And we can have individualized pricing integrated intothe car, integrated into the app, integrated into that customer's experience with a feedback loop backto the customer on how they are driving after every drive, the attributes that they were successful onor unsuccessful on, in the tips of things that they can do to improve their safety. So that's whatwe've developed.We then included the safety score as part of the FSD beta enrollment program, where we havealmost 150,000 cars currently using a safety score. And I believe the latest data is over 100 millionmiles of driving. So we've been able to go back and analyze that data. And we've learned 2 thingscoming from that. The ï¬?rst is that the probability of collision for a customer using a safety scoreversus not is 30% lower. It's a pretty big difference. It means that the product is working andcustomers are responding to it.

2021-10-20,"Yes. We can hear you.Joseph Robert Spak - RBC Capital Markets, Research Division - Autos and Leisure AnalystPerfect. So Zach, as you noticed -- or as you noted, you hit low teens operating margins. That wasyour medium-term target. You're there now despite the number of challenges and not full utilizationin some of the plants. So how are you thinking about that target now? Does it allow you to eitherdrive price down further to unlock more demand, invest in other initiatives, or does that target needto change? And then longer term, do you have an aspirational gross margin target as the mix ofsoftware and hardware changes?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. We have achieved -- we've actually exceeded our long-term guidance on our operating margintarget. So we're very pleased to see that.

The launch ofAustin and Berlin, we'll have ramp inefï¬?ciencies there for some period of time until we get thosefactories up and running. And so that's likely to put some downward pressure on our margins asthose factories ramp. Our goals are to ramp those as quickly as possible. But as Drew mentionedearlier, there are a number of unknown unknowns that we'll need to work through.We are kind of also in this uncertain environment with respect to cost structure. So we are seeingcost increase on the commodity side. We're getting feedback from our suppliers, as we are seeingourselves, the impact of labor shortage. And then logistics and expedite costs just continue to be apart of our story here, and it's uncertain how that will unfold. It's our hope that these thingsstabilize. Exactly when that happens is difï¬?cult to predict, and we have been adjusting pricing inline with those changes in cost. And so we'll see how that unfolds over the course of the next year.So it's difï¬?cult on gross margin to say where that will go for those reasons.With respect to operating margin, we've been very focused as a company on managing our overheadexpenses and operating expenses. And operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has beendeclining, and I expect that trend to continue to happen. And I think the net of all of this ishopefully that we continue to make progress on operating margin over the next 4 or 5 quarters.As we think kind of forward, the business up until this point has kind of largely been a hardwareautomotive business with a little bit of software on top of that.","Zachary J.

Just actually kind of following up on a question before. You hadmentioned commodities are rising. And when I look at a lot of the key raw materials in the battery,cobalt, nickel, lithium, all up 40%. And I know you guys have done a good job of getting long-termcontracts to sort of mitigate that impact. I mean have you seen so far any impact from that spike?And if not, I mean any sense of when that raw material headwind might actually show up or hasshown up?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. We have seen an impact. Our primary exposure right now is around nickel and aluminum,nickel on the cell, aluminum on non-cell. And we have a mixture of contracts with varioussuppliers. Some materials, we contract directly and we have full exposure to price ï¬?uctuations. Wedo have a number of long-term commitments -- long-term contracts in place. We also havecontracts where there's some amount of cost-sharing based upon the movement of indexes. And soas these have been moving, some of those costs have been ï¬?owing through to us. It's not asubstantial amount of cost but it's not small.As we look towards the next year, I certainly hope it doesn't play out this way, but it's possible thatwe continue to see more of cost headwind as a result of these movements. It's difï¬?cult to sayprecisely, but the volatility and the increases are just substantial -- so substantial. And there arecertain suppliers that, maybe up to a certain point, have been absorbing some of the increase. Andas contracts expire there or we have to renew and extend them, we'll have to return to negotiations.And so what we have to do as a company and what we are intensely focused on is we need to becontinuing to drive down the cost of our products, which we have been doing. And we have toovercome cost increases that are outside of our control.

Can you talk a little bit about your strategy around anode materials and your ability toleverage that into a reduction on the cathode side and performance from (inaudible)Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSure. I don't know that I'm going to get into too many speciï¬?cs, but I guess ï¬?rst, one thing I wouldsay is unlike the commodities discussion we just had, like the anode materials are not really in thesame situation just in terms of what their constituent components are. So there's less of a focus onlike rapidly changing them one way or the other because they're generally stable commodities.There isn't exactly like a tit for tat where like get a better anode, use less cathode. Like there's afundamental ratio that you need to maintain for the cell to function.So I guess zooming out, the primary focus on the anode side that we have is just ensuring that itdoesn't, in any way -- that we are able to continue to reduce the cost of the anode without impedingon the long-term cyclability of the product. It can also help with energy density. As you like sort ofimprove the energy density of the anode, you improve the energy density of the cell, not directly 1:1because you have to pack more cathode in as the anode gets better. And that's a focus as well butthe trade space is just sort of cycling versus day 1 cost.Colin William Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior AnalystThat's super helpful.

2021-10-20,"And I mean tobe totally frank, it's caught us a little bit off guard. And that kind of awakening and changingconsumer sentiment, I'm sure there's lots of reasons that go into it, but folks want to buy an electriccar and folks want to buy a Tesla right now. It's very exciting for us.At the same time, we have installed capacity to build more cars but we're constrained by a numberof dynamics, as we've talked about in great detail. And we are putting an extreme effort to build asmany cars as we possibly can. It's hard to overstate how extreme the efforts are. It's quite the grind.We're trying as hard as we can to maximize that capacity and to be able to meet the demand thatwe're receiving. But the net-net of all of this is that we're not able to increase production capacityfast enough.So at the same time, we are seeing macroeconomic cost impacts on our structure, as we'vediscussed previously on the call. So what we're trying to think through -- if somebody orders a carnow, it will -- it could be delivered, in some cases, depending upon the car and which factory, couldbe a couple of months, could be a couple of quarters. And the timing in which we build that car willbe just before that car gets delivered. And what will the world look like at that point? And so we'retrying to think through, how the cost structure is evolving, how does pricing need to change withthat, what are the supply dynamics in the space.The other thing that I'll just note on pricing is that companies change pricing all the time. Thedifference is that when Tesla changes pricing, it's extremely transparent, where that's not always thecase otherwise. And sometimes, our pricing will increase. Sometimes, our pricing will reduce.Sometimes, to the public, our pricing changes may not seem to make logical sense. But there is astrategy that we work behind the scenes as we're balancing supply and demand, as we're also tryingto balance various shortages on parts, as we're trying to manage wait times.

2021-10-20,"And the next question comes from Trip Chowdhry.Tripatinder S. Chowdhry - Global Equities Research, LLC - MD of Equity Research & SeniorAnalystVery good quarter. I had 2 quick questions. First is regarding the 2 upcoming factories in Berlin andAustin. How are the 2 factories different from each other, maybe in the layout, design, assemblylines?And the second question is related to Cybertruck. Who is the supplier looking at if you look at theexoskeleton steel? Is the supply for that material sufï¬?cient for immediate ramp-up, say, in '23, '24time for Cybertruck? That's all from me.Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringYes. Sure. So obviously, as we've noted in the past, we developed our own stainless-steel grade forthe exterior of Cybertruck to meet both the durability and corrosion requirements required for anautomotive world. With this raw material and others, as Drew mentioned, we continue to look atmultiple sources. We have made some early sourcing decisions in that, but I think we'll keep thatone internal, and we've already began the ï¬?rst casting-ins of that. Rolling stainless isn't so differentfrom pulling any other material. It's just about how hard the rollers are to get to that hardness level.And just like every manufacturing process we put in for every new vehicle, we'll work with oursuppliers and vendors to make sure those time lines and supply meet the need and demand of ourcustomers.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd on the differences between Austin and Berlin, there are some. They're largely associated withthe different sort of building architectural choices that were -- happened to occur in collaborationwith like local codes and other sort of governing requirements that drive the differences in thearchitecture between the locations. In general though, like we're trying to progress themanufacturing system as a system and make sort of logical, like, path to ï¬?nd improvements fromfactory to factory. And in some cases, there was an improvement identiï¬?ed between, like, decisionsfor one, Austin; the other, Berlin; or vice versa.

2021-10-20,"Yes. We can hear you.Jonathan Edward Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD & AnalystSo Brandenburg, I'm just wondering, Zach, if you could estimate the carry costs from a marginperspective. Or I guess in 2 parts. So when do you expect -- do you still expect production comingon in '21, so a couple of months left in December? And how do you see that margin impact as afunction of the carry cost? And I do have a follow-up question.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOSure. So it remains our target in both Austin and Berlin to be able to build our ï¬?rst production carsbefore the end of the year. We've talked about this a bit, the unknown unknowns, new factories, newvehicle designs, new technologies, new locations, new teams. So there is quite an execution journeyahead of us. But that remains our target and all of our plans are oriented around that. We -- for -- weshould not expect for us to deliver cars by the end of 2021 from these factories even if we doproduce them -- so homologation, regulatory reasons. And we'll want to make sure that we build upsome number of cars that we're conï¬?dent in the quality and the customer experience around them.The second thing that I'll say -- and I mentioned this in my opening remarks, is because of thenewness here, it's extremely difï¬?cult for us to be precise in what the ramp will look like. And it'spossible things -- the stars align and things move quickly. It's possible that we're spending the bulkof next year working on ramping these factories. It's just very hard to say, and we'll continue toupdate you all through these calls and through other forums.As to how that then impacts our margins, that is also difï¬?cult because that is a function of the ramp,which is uncertain. So the beneï¬?t here, which is different in the ramp of these factories compared toother factories, is if you think about the percentage of our total cost structure in any given quarterthat is associated with new ramps, we have the Fremont factory that's running, generating stable andgrowing margins there. The same is also true in Shanghai. So I expect we'll see some amount ofheadwind on margin from these ramps. It's just entirely dependent on how quickly we're able toramp and what uncertainties come up during the process.Jonathan Edward Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD & AnalystSure.","Zachary J.

2022-01-26,"Senior Director of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, ZacharyKirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m.Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ï¬?lings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. So just to recap 2021, it was a breakthrough year for Tesla and for electric vehiclesin general. And while we battled, and everyone did, with supply chain challenges through the year,we managed to grow our volumes by nearly 90% last year. This level of growth didn't happen bycoincidence. It was a result of ingenuity and hard work across multiple teams throughout thecompany.Additionally, we reached the highest operating margin in the industry in the last widely reportedquarter at over 14% GAAP operating margin. Lastly, thanks to $5.5 billion of GAAP net income in2021, our accumulated proï¬?tability since the inception of the company became positive, which Ithink makes us a real company at this point. This is a critical milestone for the company.So after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin. So we've begunproduction at both Texas and Berlin. We started that last quarter. But that's not the most importantthing. We focus more on when do we get to volume production and when can we deliver cars tocustomers. But I think it is worth noting that, and as the Internet has observed, we've been makingquite a few cars in Austin and Berlin.So in Texas, we're building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the 4680 cells, and wewill start delivering after ï¬?nal certiï¬?cation of vehicle, which should be fairly soon. Capacityexpansion will continue through maximizing output of each factory and building new factories innew locations in the future. Although we're not ready to announce any new locations on this call,but we will, through 2022, look at new locations and probably be able to announce new locationstowards the end of this year, I expect.In 2022, supply chain will continue to be the fundamental limiter of output across all factories.","Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m.Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.

2022-01-26,"Sothe chip shortage, while better than last year, is still an issue. And yes, there are multiple supplychain challenges. And last year was difï¬?cult to predict and hopefully, this year will be smooth-sailing, but I'm not sure what you do for an encore to 2021, 2020. Nonetheless, we do expect signiï¬?cant growth in 2022 over 2021, comfortably above 50% growth in 2022.Full Self-Driving. So over time, we think Full Self-Driving will become the most important sourceof proï¬?tability for Tesla. I mean actually, if you run the numbers on robotaxis, it's kind of nutty. It'snutty good from a ï¬?nancial standpoint. And I think we're completely conï¬?dent at this point that itwill be achieved. And my personal guess is that we'll achieve Full Self-Driving this year, yes, withdata safety level signiï¬?cantly greater than at present. So the cars in the ï¬?eet essentially becomingself-driving via a software update, I think, might end up being the biggest increase in asset value ofany asset class in history. We shall see. It would also have a profound impact on improving safetyand on accelerating the world towards sustainable energy through vastly better asset utilization.Let's see, so on the product road map front, there's quite a lot to talk about. I'm not going to gothrough every sort of thing that we're working on because I think a lot of them deserve productlaunches of their own as opposed to a few minutes on an earnings call. So I'll talk kind of mostly ata high level.The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output. So both last year and this year, if wewere to introduce new vehicles, our total vehicle output would decrease. This is a very importantpoint that I think a lot of people do not understand. So last year, we spent a lot of engineering andmanagement resources solving supply chain issues: rewriting code, changing our chips, reducingthe number of chips we need, with chip drama central. And that was not the only supply chainissue. So there's just hundreds of things. And as a result, we were able to grow almost 90% while atleast almost every other manufacturer contracted last year. So that's a good result.But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, our total vehicle output would have been thesame because of the chips constraints, particularly. So if we'd actually introduced an additionalproduct, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on that increased complexity ofthe additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.","The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output.

2022-01-26,"And the same is true ofthis year so we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year. It would not make any sensebecause we'll still be parts constrained. We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling andwhatnot to create those vehicles: Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring thoseto production hopefully next year. That is most likely. But like I said, it is dependent on are we ableto produce more cars or fewer cars.So in terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we'redoing this year is actually the Optimus humanoid robot. This, I think, has the potential to be moresigniï¬?cant than the vehicle business over time. If you think about the economy, the foundation ofthe economy is labor. Capital equipment is distilled labor. So what happens if you don't actuallyhave a labor shortage? I'm not sure what an economy even means at that point. That's what Optimusis about. So very important.Drew, do you want me to talk about the 4680 program? Or is this good, the right time?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Sure. So throughout 2021, we focused on growing cell supply alongside our in-house 4680effort to provide us ï¬?exibility and insurance as we attempt to grow as fast as possible. As we sittoday, sales from suppliers actually sort of exceeds our other factory-limiting constraints that youmentioned, Elon, in 2022. Or to say differently, 4680 cells are not a constraint to our 2022 volumeplans based on the information we have.But we are making meaningful progress up the ramp curve in Kato. We're building 4680 structuralpacks every day, which are being assembled into vehicles in Texas. I was driving one yesterday andthe day before. And we believe our ï¬?rst 4680 vehicles will be delivered this quarter. Our focus onthe cell, the pack and the vehicles here is driving yield quality and cost to ensure we're ready forlarger volumes this year as we ramp and next year. And the 4680 and pack tool installations here atGiga Austin are progressing well with some areas producing ï¬?rst parts. And the Internet has alsonoticed that. Yes, I was touring the cell factory here. I'm super pumped. It's like a really excitingaccomplishment for us to bring everything into one awesome factory here in Texas.Elon R.

Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. As Elon mentioned, 2021 was a ï¬?nancially transformative year for thecompany. If we look across the full year '21 and compare that to 2020, our automotive grossmargin, excluding credits, rose by over 600 basis points enabled by work on cost reduction,utilization of our Shanghai factory for exports and accelerating demand.OpEx as a percentage of revenue reduced despite the impact of onetime items and unique items.And operating income more than tripled, with operating margin reaching our guidance of mid-teens.And these margins are trending up. We also saw regulatory credits accounting for a relatively smallportion of our 2021 proï¬?tability, which we expect to continue to reduce in materiality goingforward.For Q4 speciï¬?cally, automotive gross margin, excluding credits, increased to 29.2%, which is ourhighest yet. We do continue to see some impact of higher pricing on certain models and trends aswas the case in prior quarters. But please keep in mind that due to backlogs, changes in pricing willgenerally impact our ï¬?nancials in future quarters. Supply chain challenges and port congestionresulted in a signiï¬?cant increase in our expedited costs in Q4. We also took reserves associated withwarranty and recall costs.Operating expenses were meaningfully impacted by stock-based compensation from the ï¬?nal 2tranches of the CEO stock grant becoming probable and payroll taxes associated with the exerciseof the 2012 CEO options. The total impact of these payroll taxes, warranty and recall costs andexcess expedites was just over $700 million in the quarter.Our free cash ï¬?ows have remained strong, reaching record levels in Q4 of $2.8 billion despiteincreased CapEx. In addition to using cash to grow the business as quickly as we can, we have beenretiring legacy and high interest debt. Note that we plan to continue to utilize the ABS market forproduct-speciï¬?c ï¬?nancing.As we look forward, we expect 2022 to be another signiï¬?cant and exciting year for the company.We continue to drive for vehicle volume growth at or above 50%, as Elon mentioned, and our plansshow that this is actually achievable with just our Fremont and Shanghai factories. For quite sometime now, these factories have been running below capacity due to macro challenges with supplyand logistics. As Elon mentioned as well, from what we're seeing, the pace of growth in 2022 willagain be determined by supply chain and logistics, which is quite difï¬?cult for us to forecast.Despite these constraints, it's important to begin the ramp of Austin and Berlin to ensure that we areprepared once limitations ease, enabling us to increase total output more quickly in the future.","For Q4, automotive gross margin, excluding credits, increased to 29.2%, which is ourhighest yet.

2022-01-26,"Like 6 questions.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, Dojo appears to be on track for doing something useful in the summer of this year. I think thethreshold that really matters is, at which point, when does it become more competitive than a GPUcluster for training. And obviously, the GPU cluster is getting better. So it's a moving target. Butthat's the goal I've set for the team. The FSD team running our GPU supercluster needs to tell methat they want to use Dojo instead. That's the obvious sort of threshold. And I don't know when thatwill be.I wouldn't say like success is 100% certain here. I think we just generally want to overestimatemeeting options and underestimate ourselves. But it does seem as though we might pass thatthreshold next year with Dojo if we execute well. Dojo is not needed for full self-driving but it is acost optimization on creating vast amounts of video data. Cost optimization is also a rate ofimprovement. So if you can train models faster, have a shorter iteration interval, then you can makeprogress faster. So not everything can be distributed to something like GPUs. There's someelements of serialization there.And then if Dojo is competitive, then it does seem like the kind of thing where we would offer it toother companies that want to do neural net training. Those are very much a neural net trainingoptimized system. But in theory, it should be better than a generalized computing platform or, say,GPUs, which are not really intended for -- the pixel trader is not directly intended for optimizingtraining of neural networks. They just happen to work better than CPUs in most cases. So weshould be thinking of like Dojo as like a giant ASIC optimized for neural net training, especiallyvideo [or video-like] things. But like I said, we're not saying for sure that Dojo would succeed. Wethink it will. We would encourage those who think this is an interesting problem to join Tesla.","Dojo appears to be on track for doing something useful in the summer of this year.

So to say what's the next capacity, well, it's difï¬?cult to say what that next capacity isbecause you put a lot of evidence that you increase capacity quite a lot. Look at the big picture.Initially, we always want to increase capacity at one factory because logistics cost of transportingcars needs to be considered. Especially, as the cars become more affordable, you want to havefactories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers. So even if you couldincrease output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.So in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas coming up, we would want to deliver, say, ModelYs that are going to the eastern 2/3 of the United States from this factory because the logistics costsare going to be much less.

2022-01-26,"Thank you. The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one,economies of scale; number two, production line design efï¬?ciencies; number three, reducedtransportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inï¬?ation; ornumber ï¬?ve, other sources? And how much further could margins improve and why?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. There's basically 4 major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvementwithin the company. And they're in no particular order here, but these are the big ones. So our mixof Model Y is increasing as we've ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher proï¬?t than the Model 3.And so that is helpful on our margins. And then as we increase the volume on that program withlabor efï¬?ciencies, ï¬?xed cost amortization, they improve and the costs go down as well.The second 1 here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the company.And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it. That factory had a differentline design, more efï¬?cient from the start, and we've been pushing the boundaries on the volumethere. So that has been helpful. If you recall, at the beginning of the year, we also were in atransition to the new version of the Model S and Model X. And so as that has ramped over thecourse of the year, that has been helpful. And then we've also done various price increases in certainmarkets on certain models, which has helped there. So that's generally the story at a high level.As we look over the next quarter or 2, as I mentioned in my opening remarks and the last call aswell, we have ramp inefï¬?ciencies from the launch of Austin and Berlin. We also have pressurescoming from inï¬?ation, supply chain, raw materials, et cetera. And so where that nets out is hard tosay in the immediate term. And we obviously, as a company, are going to be driving to increasemargins as much as we can. But I just want to be realistic that we're launching 2 factoriessimultaneously here and it unavoidably will add cost to the business as we do that.And as we look further out, and Elon mentioned this in his opening remarks as well, the softwareportion of the business, I think, is the one to really pay attention to.","Zachary J.

Elon, I guess my question is around the Megapack or your energybusiness. And so as we look at the strategy or the supply chain constraints that you mentioned, youhave 2 different strategies, or it seems like, with Megapack and Powerwall. And I think thePowerwall was answered with 4680 and the 2170 opening up. So I was wondering if you could justtalk about the supply chain and LFP for the Megapack and what we should expect for that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. To be clear, we do think that old stationary storage, Powerwall and Megapack, will transitionto an iron-based system, basically a non-nickel system. Manganese also could be part of the future,but primarily iron. It just comes up, iron-nickel. We need something that is formed in a star before asupernova ideally. So iron is. So there's a ridiculous amount of iron on Earth as is a ridiculousamount of lithium. So you can really expect all stationary storage to transition to iron over time.And manganese is like a wildcard. There's also less manganese. Anyway, I should say like we didshort-change the energy business last year in that vehicle took priority over the energy side not oncells but on chips.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSo just in general, societally, there's way too much value placed on the idea. It's like you have theidea of going to the moon. That's not the hard part, okay? Going to the moon is the hard part by far.And the thing is that, that is true for really most products.

2022-01-26,"The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystI have 2, please. First, you spoke a lot about FSD and how the economics could be very attractivegoing forward. I'm wondering if you could just share what your current attach rate might be forFSD on your vehicles or how to think about the progress of your attach rate or revenue in FSD, let'ssay, in '21 versus '20 and how much deferred revenue for FSD was drawn down during the year.And I have a follow-up, please.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think the FSD stuff, you really don't want to be looking at the rearview mirror. It will not be agood indicator for the future. What you need is to look out at the front windscreen because it is sucha profound step change. I mean effectively, long term, every car will have FSD. And the value ofthat will be a very big number. Just look at this as asset utilization, you have a passenger car, whichnormally is driven maybe 1.5 hours a day on average, maybe 10, 12 hours a week, a lot of cars inthe parking lots, so you're spending money not just driving the cars but storing them all over theplace. We can get rid of a lot of parking lots if you have a car that is operating all the time.But there will be a challenge with trafï¬?c. So we have like this little tiny baby company, The BoringCompany, which I initially started as a joke. And now I think it actually could be quite essential toalleviating the insane trafï¬?c that will happen when cars are autonomous because you reduce thepain of travel and you reduce the cost of travel so dramatically that there will be a crazy number ofcars on the road. I mean I think it will be cheaper to go point to point with a robotaxi, which is anautonomous Tesla, which every car we've made in the past 3 or 4 years will be capable of that, thana bus or a subway. It will cost less than the subsidized value of a bus ticket. So if you want to get --cool, I'm not going to take the bus.If it costs you, I don't know, for argument's sake, $2 to travel 10 miles point to point, nobody istaking the bus, especially in cold weather or it's dark or maybe a little bit dangerous, to hell withthat.","I think the FSD stuff, you really don't want to be looking at the rearview mirror.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystOkay. Elon, I was wondering if I could just follow up and ask you, you talked about your productroad map and also your goal to keep growing at 50% per year or better. That would put you at 3.2million vehicles or more in 2024. And I think you made reference to Cybertruck maybe being250,000 vehicles. If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think thatyou can sell more than 3 million vehicles with 2 very high-volume cars and Cybertruck in 2024?How do we think about that? Or what else is missing in that equation?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean it's apparent from the questions that the gravity of full self-driving is not fullyappreciated. If an asset has 5x more utilization, in fact, it's like dividing the cost of that asset by 5.So if you have a $50,000 car, it's like having a $10,000 car all of a sudden. But maybe better thanthat, because still you may want to drive, so the person can be engaged in productivity oramusement instead of having to onerously drive through trafï¬?c. So it's probably better than 5x. Idon't know. Yes. I mean basically, if the cost of our cars do not change at all, we would still sell asmany as we could possibly make.","A.M.

And the question I had is,I understand well the ramp of 4680 internally, but I'd be curious to hear you talk about how youthink about 4680 as being a form factor that your suppliers could adopt as well and how you see, inthe long run, in the greater scheme of things, what does 4680 become.

Is it something that you guys are going to deploy in allcars, whatever the chemistry, also in the Megapack, in all your energy storage business? And doyou expect eventually a lot of other companies to use that form factor as well?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. On the 4680 as a form factor, yes, we've engaged with a number of our partners, our suppliers,on the form factor. And they're all working on it. And they look at it the way we look at it as a wayto drive fundamental cost efï¬?ciencies in production and also, ultimately, the design of the cell itselfto drive the cost down of the cell. I mean we're engaged because we think it's a good form factor.They're engaged because they think it's a good form factor. And we want people to make it for sure.To the question about should everything be 4680, it doesn't have to be. In the end, it's about costcompetitiveness, scalability of manufacturing. And when you compare like an iron cell with anickel cell, for example, like there are some just physics-based differences in what happens incertain corner cases that would drive different form factors, and we just have to be cognizant of thatand design to that. So it isn't like the ultimate form factor for all things. There's other form factorsthat could be better for an iron cell, for example.Elon R.","Elon R.

But a lot of these things are alleviating. I think there's some degree of the toilet paperproblem as well where there was a toilet paper shortage during COVID. Obviously, it wasn't reallycertainly a tremendous enhanced need for ass wiping. It's just people panicked and got every paperproduct you could possibly wipe your ass with basically. And I wasn't sure, is this like a real thingor not? I actually took my kids to the H-E-B and Walmart in Texas to just conï¬?rm if it was real.Indeed, it was. And there's plenty of food and everything else but just nothing, no paper products.That didn't cause us [plenty].An odd choice for people to panic about, yes, because these things are -- actually, if end of theworld is coming, I think toilet paper is the least of your problems.

Zach?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. Just to start off here, Q1 was a challenging but extremely successful quarterfor the company. Despite numerous supply interruptions, including shutdowns at our Shanghaifactory and nearby suppliers due to COVID, we've continued making progress and achieved ourbest-ever vehicle deliveries.Last quarter, we demonstrated a series of new ï¬?nancial records, including revenue, gross margins,operating margin and bottom line proï¬?tability. GAAP automotive gross margin reached 32.9% and,for the ï¬?rst time, exceeded 30% when excluding regulatory credits. Higher pricing continues topositively impact our ï¬?nancials as we make progress delivering cars in our growing backlog. Notethat, for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long. Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generallycarried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being ordered today.Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well. Inï¬?ation, raw material prices, expedites and logisticscosts continue to impact our cost structure. Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efï¬?cient manner.Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more proï¬?table vehicles, including the Model Y . Wealso recognized a onetime beneï¬?t of $288 million from credit revenue relating to a regulatorychange in the U.S. CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined comparedto the same period last year.The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions more severely than thevehicle business. Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes haveimpacted supply of certain components for our solar systems, which is reï¬?ected in our solar volumefor the quarter.OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and other items.

2022-04-20,"And Elon has opening remarks as well.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSure. Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach's, but it's maybe worth repeating. Q1 wasonce again a record quarter on many levels by reaching the highest deliveries, proï¬?t and anoperating margin of 19%. This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and anoverall difï¬?cult quarter. So I'd really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving recordproï¬?tability and output despite many, many difï¬?cult headwinds. And especially the Tesla Chinateam in our Shanghai factory, they really had signiï¬?cant challenges due to the COVID shutdownsand nonetheless have been able to output a tremendous number of high-quality vehicles, and we arealready back up and running with the Shanghai factory.So as Zach said, we remain conï¬?dent of a 50% growth in vehicle production in 2022 versus '21. Ithink we actually have a reasonable shot at a 60% increase over last year. So let's see. Obviously,we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months,so with 2 fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly. Now with newfactories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially. So I have very highconï¬?dence in the teams in both factories, and we expect to ramp those initially slowly but, like Isaid, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.So we're also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is adedicated robotaxi. That's highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steeringwheel or pedals. And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quiteexciting. That is fundamentally optimized for -- it's trying to achieve the lowest fully consideredcost per mile or cost per kilometer, accounting everything. And so it's, I think, going to be a verypowerful product. We aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024. So I think that really willbe a massive driver of Tesla's growth. And we remain on track to reach volume production of theCybertruck next year.So basically, once again, I'd like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I'd liketo thank our suppliers who have really gone the extra mile. We have an amazing supplier group, andI want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure thatTesla is able to keep the factories running.And we're really at the early stages of that journey.","Q1 wasonce again a record quarter on many levels by reaching the highest deliveries, proï¬?t and anoperating margin of 19%.

2022-04-20,"Let's go to the ï¬?rst investor question. And the ï¬?rst investor question is, Elonhas historically provided FSD time lines with, note, optimal accuracy. We love his optimism for2022 release. But is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their ownconclusions on progress being made, interventions per mile driven or any other data?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSure. Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I've ever been involvedin, I've never really seen more kind of false dawns, or where it seems like we're going to breakthrough but we don't, as I've seen in full self-driving. And ultimately, what it comes down to is thatto solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world artiï¬?cial intelligence, which nobodyhas solved. The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes. And so actually,when you think about it, in order to solve full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and camerasto a degree of some capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.And I think we will achieve that this year. The best way to reach your own assessment is to join theTesla full self-driving beta program where we have over 100,000 people right now enrolled in thatprogram, and we expect to broaden that signiï¬?cantly this year. So that's my recommendation, jointhat full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take note of the rate ofimprovement with every release. And we put out a new release roughly every 2 weeks. And you'llsee a little bit of 2 steps forward, 1 step back. But overall, the rate of improvement is incrediblyquick. So that's my recommendation for reaching your own assessment, literally try it.","The best way to reach your own assessment is to join theTesla full self-driving beta program where we have over 100,000 people right now enrolled in thatprogram, and we expect to broaden that signiï¬?cantly this year.

2022-04-20,"Thank you. The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown inShanghai have in Q2? What is the time line for localizing the Model 3 in Europe? Or will newermodels be prioritized in Berlin?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, we did lose a lot of important days of production. And because there are sort of upstreamsupplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also lost many days of production. But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance. So I think notwithstanding new issues that arise,I think we will see a record output per week from Giga Shanghai this quarter, albeit we are missinga couple of weeks. So that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1,maybe slightly lower, but it's also possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher.But it's really, call it, roughly on par. Then Q3 and Q4 will be substantially higher. So it seemslikely that we'll be able to produce over 1.5 million cars this year. That's my best guess.And then Model 3. It's important for new factories to be focused and have the least amount ofcomplexity and variation, which is why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y .From the point in which you have a factory complete and you're making a small number of units tothe point where it's producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of 9 to 12 months from start ofproduction. So now hopefully, we're getting better at that ramp, so maybe it's a little less.

Ithink the simple way -- we estimate around 10% to 15% of our cost structure exposed to rawmaterials. And just to clarify a couple of things on that. So we've been experiencing increases incost in general, but also raw materials, for a number of quarters now. That pace picked up in Q1, solast quarter. And what we're seeing for Q2 is slightly higher than that as well.And as indices move, it doesn't impact us immediately or directly. In some cases, we have contractswith suppliers. But then, as those contracts expire, we have to renegotiate them so that there can bea lag. In some cases, our contracts do directly reï¬?ect movement in commodity prices or rawmaterial prices.

Separately, why isn't Tesla using 800-voltarchitecture in its vehicles? What are the advantages or disadvantages?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSo from Tesla's standpoint, obviously, we'd love to have federal legislation that allows direct salesin all states, but we have not seen willingness on the part of the Congress to enact such law thatwould override a variety of state laws. So unfortunately, we have to ï¬?ght it on a state-by-state basis.And Drew, do you want to answer the 800-volt question?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, sure. On the 800-volt thing, yes, so it's really a case-by-case thing. For the smaller platformvehicles like 3 and Y , there's some wins and losses with 800 volts, not everything is better. And sowe look at that platform and we're not like ignoring the reality that you can go to a higher voltage,but there's nothing really encouraging us to do so on that platform. It's really about mass and power.And as you look at bigger vehicles, there are some advantages on those bigger vehicles.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorLet me just quantify that. Basically, our estimate is that going from 400 to 800 volts might save$100.

2022-04-20,"Thank you. And the next question is, how does Tesla plan to secure raw materials required to scaleto extreme size?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. So this is something we think about quite a lot. It depends what extreme size means. Butcertainly looking at, like, say, the $5 million, $10 million, $20 million -- 5 million, 10 million, 20million vehicle levels, you really have to analyze sort of macroeconomic, just like what is thetonnage of lithium that you need, of nickel, of iron phosphate, of graphite separators, electrolytes. Itlooks like -- really think of like just macro tonnage.And we need to think about this for the world as a whole because just -- we want to what -- there'slimiting factors for accelerating the advent of a sustainable energy future. And whatever the mostlimiting factors are, Tesla will take action on those limiting factors. So right now, we think miningand reï¬?ning lithium appears to be a limiting factor, and it certainly is responsible for quite a bit ofcost growth in the cells. It's, I think, the single biggest cost growth item right now absolutely on apercentage basis. Although just for those who don't totally know this, the actual content of lithiumin lithium ion cell is maybe around 2% or 3% of the cell.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy Engineering5 kgs a car.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, 5 kilograms exactly.

And we know prices are much higher now just giventhe supply constraints. Prices are higher for all other automakers. We know that there's inï¬?ation thatyou're battling through, and some of that needs to be passed through the price of the vehicles. Andyou're going to be supply constrained for the foreseeable future, so it's sort of a moot point. Butgiven the goal long term of making EVs more widely available to the masses over time, how do youlook at the progression of prices over time?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe absolutely want to make EVs as affordable as possible. It's been very difï¬?cult with the -- I meanI think inï¬?ation is at like a 40- or 50-year high. And I think that the ofï¬?cial numbers actuallyunderstate the true magnitude of inï¬?ation. And that inï¬?ation appears to be likely to continue for atleast the remainder of this year is what -- when we're talking to suppliers, suppliers are under severecost pressure, so yes. And in some cases, we're seeing suppliers request 20% to 30% cost increasesfor parts from last year to the end of this year. So there's a lot of cost pressure there.That's why we raised our prices because we -- when things [lose sense] with respect to inï¬?ation,you know it's high, and we've got orders that go out a year or more, in some cases, then we have toanticipate those cost increases.

2022-04-20,"Let's go to the next question from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystI'm trying to just parse out your comments about the inï¬?ation and constrained supply and batteryfeedstocks and the initiatives that you are working on internally to secure these materials. It soundslike you're optimistic about Tesla's ability to solve this for Tesla. But do you see this as a constrainton EV adoption more broadly?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Absolutely. What's sort of keeping our costs down, at least in the short term, is that we havelong-term contracts with suppliers. But those long-term contracts will obviously run out and thenwe'll start to see potentially signiï¬?cant cost increases. But the macro -- sort of looking at the worldas a whole and saying, ""Okay, what does it take for us to transition to sustainable energy faster?"" It'sfundamentally -- the fundamental limiting factor is the output of cell -- basically, cell output. Atwhat rate can lithium ion cells increase the gigawatt hours per year, that is the fundamental limitingfactor. So in order -- and that will move as fast as the slowest, least likely element of the wholesupply chain.Currently, we see that as being a challenge with lithium. To be clear, it's not that there's a shortageof lithium ore in the world. Lithium is present almost everywhere. It's a very common element.However, you still need to take up the ore, take up basically the sludge or the clay with the lithium,and then you need to go through a whole series of reï¬?nement steps. And that's a lot of industrialequipment that's needed to reï¬?ne lithium ore to lithium that can be used as lithium hydroxide orlithium carbonate in a battery cell.So we think we're going to need to help the industry on this front. I mean the industry is growingfast and I certainly encourage entrepreneurs out there who are looking for opportunities to get intothe lithium business. Lithium margins right now are practically software margins. I mean Zach,correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we're seeing cases where the spot lithium price is 10x higherthan the cost of extraction. So not like we're talking [19%] margins here. Can more people pleaseget into the lithium business? Do you like minting money?

2022-04-20,"So I guess we'll stay tuned to see what happens from that. My second question is, it'simpressive to see just a modest increase in cost per vehicle, cost of goods sold per vehicle, givenwhat we've seen in terms of commodities actually. And from here, you have a lot of savingsopportunities with 4680 cells and the cell manufacturing changes, the anode chemistry structuralpacks, giga castings. Are you suggesting that even those may not be sufï¬?cient to offset the inï¬?ationthat you're seeing and that you're going to need additional pricing as well in addition to thosespeciï¬?c initiatives that you've called out?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe hope we don't need to increase the pricing further. The current pricing is anticipating what wethink is the probable growth in costs. And if that growth in cost does not materialize, we actuallymay slightly reduce prices. So we don't currently anticipate making signiï¬?cant price increases. Butobviously, we don't control the macroeconomic environment. If governments keep printing vastamounts of money and if there are not signiï¬?cant increases in lithium extraction and reï¬?nement andother raw materials such that everyone is competing for a limited amount of raw materials then,obviously, that will drive prices to high levels. So if you have a crystal ball that can tell us what thefuture is going to be like, we'll adjust accordingly. But the current prices are for a vehicle deliveredin the future, like 6 to 12 months from now. So this is our best guess.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringBut I think if you zoom out, right, like as you said, our mission is to accelerate the transition tosustainable energy. So we are working with our existing suppliers and others to ï¬?gure out how togrow all of these raw materials as quickly as possible to not slow down the transition. And whetherthat means we have to get directly involved in some cases or not comes down to the counterpartyand their willingness to expand at the rate we think they should be able to expand. And that'ssimilar to what we've done with everything else. Like we built a Gigafactory in Reno because itneeded to be done. And so like we will do what needs to be done to not slow down the transition.And affordability is a goal.

2022-04-20,"Yes.Colin M. Langan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity AnalystPerfect. Just to follow up, sorry to keep going on the raw material issue on the battery side, butobviously, it seems pretty important. How quickly can raw material supply be built? Because myunderstanding is it takes many years to build that out. So are we just sort of phasing? When do youthink we see a lithium shortage or a nickel shortage? And is there even enough time to build thatsort of mining capacity in place? And then related, how quickly can you switch to like LFP for thenickel issue?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. I mean I'll take the LFP question. Like it says so in our letter, like half of our products wereLFP last quarter, which shows how quickly we were able to respond to -- well, honestly, it wasn'tbecause of a raw material shortage but just because it seemed like the right thing to do, we couldchange our cathode chemistry. And there's more to be done on the cathode side, and we are activelypursuing it to give us substitution ï¬?exibility in response to market conditions between the othercathodes that are out there that can be competitive in our vehicles for which there are many options.I guess what I would say is, speciï¬?cally on the cathode side, like ï¬?exibility is the way we're goingto achieve this. And not all of the materials that go into cathodes are actually, ï¬?rst of all, hard tosecure like through mining or reï¬?ning; and second of all, in many cases, are like very plentifulalready, like huge scale. And if all of the batteries in the world use those cathodes, it's less than a1% increase in total annual output. So that's the cathode side.I think Elon already spent a lot of time talking about lithium. It really depends on the resource.Some resources like just getting rocks out of the ground. Expanding the amount of rock that you'regetting out of the ground is maybe a little bit of paperwork and some additional sort of blasting andtrucking operations. The reï¬?ning is maybe where it's a little bit more chunky to bring it online. Butalso the reï¬?ning doesn't -- it's not like an oil reï¬?nery. It's a much, much smaller operation to reï¬?nelithium out of spodumene or liquid like a brine or a salt pond evaporation.

And I was readingsocial media on Monday after we launched in the 3 new states, a lot of folks are reporting theirstories of saving quite substantial amounts of money relative to their previous insurance. And sowe're quite encouraged by that. And we're working as quickly as we can to get to 80% of customershaving access to a Tesla Insurance product by the end of this year in the United States, at whichpoint we'll pivot our attention to expansion outside of the U.S.The other thing I'll say on insurance is with these 3 new states, the model is different because weare now the underwriter, and we are also now holding the risk. And so with those states, we are afully vertically integrated provider of insurance from systems and ï¬?nancials. With respect to theï¬?nancials of the program, it's still very early. And so as the program gets more scale, happy to sharemore information on that.Elon R.

And so when peoplesee -- they can see their real-time score, they realize, ""If I make compelling changes in my drivinghabits, then I pay less in insurance.""

Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ï¬?lings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you, Martin. So just as a Q2 recap, Q2 was a unique quarter for Tesla due to a prolongedshutdown of our Shanghai factory. But in spite of all these challenges, it was one of the strongestquarters in our history. Most importantly, in June, we achieved production records in both Fremontand Shanghai. And as a result, we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.I do want to emphasize this is obviously subject to force majeure, things outside of our control. Thepast few years have been quite a few force majeures, and it's been kind of supply chain hell forseveral years. Credit to our awesome Tesla supply chain team for overcoming in saving difï¬?cultchallenges. And huge thanks to the Tesla Shanghai factory team who sacriï¬?ced a lot to get thefactory back up and running in June and achieve a record output.So also making good progress with production ramp with Berlin. We achieved an importantmilestone of 1,000 cars a week in June. And we're expecting -- sorry, our Giga Texas to exceed the1,000-vehicle per week milestone and hopefully in the next few months.To be clear, we're currently making the cars with the 2170 cells, and Drew Baglino will addresssome of the 4680 questions later in this call. But it is worth emphasizing that we have enough 2170cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of the year. So we're not dependent on 4680.4680 will be important next year but it is not important for this year.That said, we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells inTexas. And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expandcapacity.Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD Beta with City Streets driving capability toover 100,000 owners.","During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.

2022-07-20,"They're very happy with the capability of the system and we'll continue toimprove it every week. We've now driven over 35 million miles with FSD Beta. That's moreautonomous miles than any company we're aware of, I think probably more than -- it might be more than any -- all other companies combined. So -- and that mileage is growing exponentially.With regard to manufacturing and technology, about 5 or 6 years ago, we said we wanted to becomethe best manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat counterintuitively, to some people, willactually be, I think, our strongest competitive advantage. We're super pro-manufacturing here atTesla. And in general, we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing. Andin general, I think it is a very important thing to do. We need to make stuff and make it efï¬?cientlyand that's manufacturing.So we've made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes. As we now show in theshareholder deck, thanks to our -- the large castings, we make the world's largest castings. Wereduced body welding robot count by 70% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin. So that's, callit, roughly a body shop that is roughly 3x smaller than would normally be the case. And I shouldsay it's also lighter, cheaper and has superior noise vibration harshness. So it's good on every level.But this journey is not over. We'll bring another level of simplicity and manufacturingimprovements with Cybertruck and future products that we're not quite ready to talk about now butI think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detectsimminent collision, which has never been done before. So you can imagine that if you have aseatbelt that only tensions upon impact, you have very little time to tension the seatbelt. If you'vegot to be -- the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner. But because we havevision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with 100% probability before it actuallyhappens.And so we can tension the seat belts, and we can even adjust the airbag deployment because we cansee, not just feel. This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer. Andthere's also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have atleast AP3 hardware.In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.","We've now driven over 35 million miles with FSD Beta.

This answer will be understood by 0.01% of the audience, I think. I suppose people want toï¬?nd out what a uniï¬?ed factory space would actually mean. It essentially would be if you can take --if instead of netting together static and dynamic objects in C++, if they could be net together at theneural net level, then you don't need to reconcile them within C++ heuristics.That is an architecturally better way to -- that's the most desirable outcome.

2022-07-20,"Thank you. The next question is Elon recently tweeted about lowering prices once inï¬?ation coolsdown. Can you elaborate on what do you mean by cooling down and how aggressively thecompany will lower prices? More broadly, how do you think about the auto pricing long term?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. So since we have -- there's a quite a long wait when somebody orders in a car, in some cases, 6months; in some cases, it could be up to a year. We have to anticipate what the probable inï¬?ationrate is over that period of time. So that's what we're trying to do. When we -- when or if we seeindications that the inï¬?ation rate is declining, then we would not need to increase our car prices. It'spossible that there could be a slight decrease in car prices, but this is fundamentally dependent onmacroeconomic inï¬?ation. It's not something we control.If I were to guess, and I would take this with a grain of salt, I think inï¬?ation will decline towardsthe end of this year.

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, do you want to do the architecture?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. So structural pack where we get dual use of the battery cells as structure and as energy storagein the same way that an aircraft gets dual use of the wing as a fuel tank and as a wing is, I think,unequivocally, from a physics standpoint, the superior architecture. It's the A architecture.Now because it is new, we'll start off getting, I don't know, aspirationally a C within an Aarchitecture. But the potential is there for to get radically better and then unequivocally better than abattery pack, which is carried like a sack of potatoes.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. And we've gained the perspective through putting our ï¬?rst structural pack in production that itis actually the A architecture.

And now we've actually built and are moreconï¬?dent in that assertion.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. So exactly. So the structural pack, even the C and the A architecture is beating thenonstructural pack. And so over time, it will, with further reï¬?nement, be substantially superior to acar that is carrying a battery pack as though it is cargo.

2022-07-20,"The next question is on 4680 as well, but I think Andrew has coveredeverything that was in the next question.So the following question is with regards to the ramp of production in Austin and Berlin. How isthe situation with regards to supply of semiconductors, battery cells and other components? Howabout cost inï¬?ation impacting proï¬?tability of these other plants?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringI can take that. So Tesla procures about 1,600 unique pieces of silicon from 43 semiconductorcompanies. So with a portfolio of that size, there are always challenges. Things are more stable onthe latest generation chips. We still see some tightness in the older generation semiconductors,especially in the analog and mixed signal space. But we have line of sight to solve for the volumesbeing contemplated for both Austin and Berlin.And on the cell front, like Elon mentioned, we have a comfortable margin, thanks to record outputfrom our partners and have line of sight that matches the planned output from both factories. We'vegrown cell production signiï¬?cantly on a 12-month rolling basis and have long-term contracts withall our partners for key battery metals.

Q2 was our largest increase yet over the lasthandful of quarters on inï¬?ation and commodity-related increases to our cars. It's fairly evenlyspread across the factories, given common suppliers or common issues that impact the broad supplychain.So I think I had mentioned before that we have been seeing increases over the course of last year. Itticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2. So as we lookthrough to the end of the year, what we're seeing is we don't think the inï¬?ation-related increases inQ3 will be as big as Q2. But as Elon has mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.And we don't have full exposure, as [Karen] had just mentioned, on every component of costbecause we do have some contracts in place.

And I'd love to understandwhere you stand on the technology and efï¬?ciency and energy density road map that you describedat the Battery Day. So what I'm trying to understand is where do you stand on the architecture of thebattery cell itself? How much silicon do you have in it? How much energy improvement have youachieved already so far?And the reason why I'm asking that is because you have like very smart guys on Twitter who sharedexperience about trying to fully empty a Model Y from Texas from Austin and noticing behaviorsand like recharging behavior that suggested that maybe these cars had like very, very high mileage,very high range, and were like artiï¬?cially limited in range in software. So I'm just kind of trying tounderstand how much of an edge you're building at the moment with the 4680 and the battery backon range.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Let me just try to provide like a super straightforward answer. Like as Elon mentioned before,our priority was really on simplicity and scale during the initial 4680 and structural battery ramp.So we weren't like putting all the bells and whistles in from day 1 because if so, we would be sort ofsuffering under a string of serious miracles that we would need to achieve to get going.But as we attain the manufacturing goals that we've stated at the ramp that we need to hit next year,we are certainly planning to layer in new material technologies and higher-range structural packs,like we're not like holding back goodies for some rainy day or something like that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Maybe another way of putting it is that the -- our focus right now is on the dozens of littleissues that inhibit the production ramp of the 4680.

In the case of lithium, lithium is one of the most commonelements on Earth. It's pretty much everywhere.But reï¬?ning of the lithium into ultra-high purity battery-grade lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonateis quite difï¬?cult and requires a massive amount of machinery and it's a hard thing to scale.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, right now, our problem is very much production. So we've long leads on -- as anyone can tell,if they order our car, you order Model Y , it'll arrive sometime next year. So this is clearly not anissue for many months for us. Our problem is overwhelmingly that of production. So yes.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOOkay. Maybe just 2 things to add.

The second thing to Elon's point about backlogs, we have a very long runwaywith very long lead times here. I mean, certainly, the world is uncertain, and we'll have to see wherethings go with commodity prices, how quickly we're ramping production, what the state of the roadlooks like at some point next year. But the demand is not something we spend really any timetalking about.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I think it's -- maybe just 1 thing worth mentioning the -- that there is surface between value formoney and fundamental affordability because sometimes people say, ""Well, if you got all thisdemand. Why don't you just raise the price to some -- double the price or something?"" And this isusually expressed by somebody who's rich.But there's -- even if you rail value for money to inï¬?nity, if somebody does concerns, do not haveenough money to buy it, even a product where the desirability is rail to inï¬?nity, they basicallycannot buy it. So this is why you kind of just raise prices to some arbitrarily high level because youpass the affordability boundary and then the demand falls off a cliff.So I do feel like we've raised our prices or we raise the price quite a few times.","Elon R.

In response to the question around demand, I think, Zach, you said maybe alittle, and Elon, you said maybe some indication that you might see some pressure on demand. AndI'm wondering if that is really just speculation or whether there's any empirical data that you saw inthe last month, whether it be cancellations or order lead times that led you to make that comment.I think anecdotally, if you squint, the lead times have gotten a little lower over the last 4 months inboth China and the U.S. That's really the only visibility investors have.

And I think that's an advantage we have that many other OEsjust simply cannot.I think Tesla is as much a software company as it is a hardware company.

We hadour industry-leading operating margin reached 17%. And our free cash ï¬?ow surpassed $3 billion inQ3 and approached $9 billion in the past 12 months. As our factories ramp, we're looking forwardto a record-breaking Q4. So it really, knock on wood, it looks like we'll have an epic end of year. SoQ4 is looking extremely good.On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week withvery good quality and is ramping rapidly. Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestonevery soon. And in fact just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday's hold rate, it would be 2,000.Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter. We are ï¬?nallygaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell. And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to startincorporating in cars and having it be a signiï¬?cant portion of our production here in Texas in thecoming months. We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells inTexas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3. And we intend to keepraising production in Fremont.Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and showed the ï¬?rstprototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range ofimprovements of full self-driving software.Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving beta mode, and this numbercontinues to grow exponentially.

I can't emphasizethe importance of this enough because I think it ï¬?nally has become clear to the smallest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.So this quarter, we expect to go to wide release of full self-driving beta in North America. Soanyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving will have access to the FSD Betaprogram this year, probably about a month from now. So and then, obviously, any new -- anyonewho buys a car and purchase a full self-driving option will immediately have that available to them.So the safety that we're seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually signiï¬?cantly greater than thesafety we're seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.Let's see, with respect to demand. We've got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks. I can'temphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we makefor as far into the future as we can see. So the factories are running at full speed, and we'redelivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong. We are still a very smallpercentage of the total vehicles on the road.

2022-10-19,"I can't emphasize this enough with investors. And I think long-time investors,obviously recognize this with Tesla. We have our sort of local ups and downs, but long-term trendhas been extremely good. And several years ago I said, I think on our earnings call, that I thought itwas possible for Tesla to be worth more than Apple, which was then the highest market capcompany, I think, in the market. And Apple, at that time, I think was around $700 billion. And Isaid it required incredible execution and at least some luck.And we didn't only achieve that. Tesla went, in fact, or passed Apple's market cap at the time. Andnow I am of the opinion that we can far exceed Apple's current market cap. In fact, I see a potentialpath with Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. So now that doesn'tmean it will happen or that will be easy. In fact, I think it will be very difï¬?cult. It will require a lotof work, some very creative new products, managed expansion and, always, luck.But for the ï¬?rst time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let's say, roughly twice the valueof Saudi Aramco. I think that's -- I haven't quite seen that yet. I mean this is the ï¬?rst time I've seenthat potential.So we have an incredible product portfolio. I think we've got the most exciting product portfolio ofany company on earth, some of which you've heard about, some of which you haven't. We're in theï¬?nal lap for Cybertruck. We're building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas Austin and making alot of progress in the robotaxi platform design.And then with respect to batteries, we're moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve 1,000gigawatt hours a year of production capacity in the United States, vertically integrated. And ourcathode reï¬?ning, we're moving a ton of speed to do that.So I think it's an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future. But none of thiswould be possible without the incredible team that we have here at Tesla. So I'd like to give a hugeshout-out to all of our factory employees, engineers, executives and the whole Tesla team. You guysrock. You're the ones making it happen. Thank you.

2022-10-19,"And Zach has some opening remarks as well.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. Just to continue on Elon's theme, I just want to thank and congratulate theTesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the thirdquarter.On automotive proï¬?tability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2%, with automotive gross marginat 27.9%. Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it toQ1.Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been ourstrongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%. Note that while small andgrowing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to proï¬?tability.We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, aswe've discussed at length on prior calls. In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchangewas a big part of this past quarter.On energy proï¬?tability, we achieved our strongest gross proï¬?t yet for this business, driven primarilyby record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products. Our free cash ï¬?ows were also arecord despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact onworking capital.Speciï¬?cally on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2, we've started toexperience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn't anticipate. This issue isparticularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of theU.S. and Europe. Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads toextreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the ï¬?nal weeks of each quarter. Just to putthis in perspective, roughly 2/3 of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and 1/3 in the ï¬?nal 2weeks. As a result, we have begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduceour peak needs for outbound logistics. We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs andimprove the experience of our customers.As we look ahead, our plans show that we're on track for the 50% annual growth in production thisyear, although we are tracking supply chain risks, which are beyond our control. On the deliveryside, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end ofthe year, as noted, just above. This means that, again, you should expect a gap between productionand deliveries in Q4, and those cars in transit will be delivered shortly to their customers uponarrival to their destination in Q1.Boston and Berlin ramp costs will continue to weigh on margins, although we expect the impact tobe less than what we saw in Q3.","On automotive proï¬?tability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2%, with automotive gross marginat 27.9%.

But Iwouldn't say it's recession-proof. But it's certainly recession-resilient because, basically, it has --people both have large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars.And then in transitioning electricity generation to sustainable, you need solar and wind with thestationary battery pack to buffer the power. So you have 24/7 power because the wind doesn't blowand the sun doesn't shine all the time.

We do not particularly constrainourselves. We don't particularly integrate just for the hell of particularly integrating. Like if there's agreat supplier who's better than us or we think at least very good, or even where the economics arecomparative advantage suggests that we should use that supplier, even if we could beat them, butwe could use our resources to do something else that will be more productive, then we would in-source in that case. But if we have to go mine, we will mine.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDElon, my follow-up is 1 terawatt hour of manufacturing in the United States, vertically integrated.

And the suggestion that we have is that there should be an expeditedpermitting process for anything which is critical to a sustainable energy future.So it doesn't make sense to put like a coal mine and a sustainable energy battery like lithium mine inthe same category. Coal is not in the future, lithium does. And by the way, you can extract lithiumwith almost no disturbance to the local environment. So it's not actually ugly, nasty miningsituation.So I would recommend, expedited permitting would really be helpful.

I mean but that's the rough -- just give you all -- it's on that order. It's not like a month. It's not6 months. It's years. And we are executing on all of those different ideas pretty aggressively inparallel with the OpEx that some people think isn't enough, but we're getting it done.Elon R.

Yes, we can hear you now.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureGreat. I'd love to have another update on 4680, Drew. Last time we talked about it, there were --it was a question about like scaling out manufacturing and there were still a few things to get right. Is it fair to say that now you are at scale, and it's just a question of logistics to get bigger? So that'squestion number one. And then question number two, on the kind of like innovation and cost reduction and efï¬?ciencyimprovements kind of path that you described at the battery day, where are we today?

And that sort of leaning out of yields, the ï¬?nal cycle time to achieve target. You mentionedlogistics, it's not something that we're speciï¬?cally focused on, I guess, but eventually could be aproblem as we're talking about hundreds of gigawatt hours at different sites across the UnitedStates.But I would never sit here and say we have no challenges remaining. But we've made a lot ofprogress reducing technical risk in many areas. Cycle times have dramatically improved. Yield hasdramatically improved. And just walking the line here in Texas, like Martin was walking ityesterday, made some comments to me. You really see the acceleration around you. And we'vemade a ton of simpliï¬?cations moving from the Fremont factory to Texas, and it's coming to play inspeed of ramp here. And of course, that's on one line of many here in Texas.

And the last question comes from William Stein from Truist.William Stein - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MDI guess I'll go at one that I asked last time, Elon, which is your expectation for the likelihood ofcommercial success in each of the 3 major AI endeavors, FSD sort of as imagined without a driver,the training computer and, of course, Optimus.Elon R.

Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Timein the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ï¬?lings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you, Martin. So '22 -- just going through the '22 recap. It was a fantastic year for Tesla. Itwas our best year ever on every level. Team did an amazing job. It's an honor, of course, to workwith such an incredibly talented group of people.So in 2022, we delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highestamong any volume carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker. While doing so, we generated$12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash ï¬?ow. Importantly, the Tesla team achievedthese records while -- despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forcedshutdowns, very high interest rates and many delivery challenges. So it's worth noting that all theserecords were in the face of massive difï¬?culties. Credit to the team for achieving that.The most common question we've been getting from investors is about demand. Thus far -- so Iwant to put that concern to rest. Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-datethan ever in our history. We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production. So Imean that -- it's hard to say whether that will continue twice the rate of production, but the ordersare high. And we've actually raised the Model Y price a little bit in response to that.So we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as awhole. So basically, price really matters. I think there's just a vast number of people that want tobuy a Tesla car but can't afford it. And so these price changes really make a difference for theaverage consumer. And sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money,they sort of forget about how important affordability is.","During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.

2023-01-25,"And it's always been our goal at Tesla tomake cars that are affordable to as many people as possible so I'm glad that we're able to do so. Andyes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered. We're also making very good progress on costcontrol. And we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with thegrowth in production, as you'd expect, so yes.With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed Full Self-Driving Beta to -- for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America. This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Betais the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy. And we'recurrently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways. And our published data showsthat improvement in safety -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear. So we would not havereleased the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year,and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at GigaNevada yesterday. Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cellsproduced internally and continue to use the self cell providers. So to be clear, we will continue touse other cell providers. Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-inï¬?nite and will befor quite some time. So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internallyproduced cells. And we've got an amazing plan for making the 4680 cell low cost and high energydensity.So energy storage also saw record growth, and that is continuing to accelerate. That's always worthremembering that the 3 pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric vehicles, solarand wind, and the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind,because obviously, the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. So youhave those 3 things.

Additionally, we continued tomake progress on overhead efï¬?ciencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue improvedfurther.For Q4 speciï¬?cally, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions as we aremanaging through COVID impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S.and a rising interest rate environment. Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectivelyincreased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly 10%.Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by 3 factors:ï¬?rst is raw materials and inï¬?ation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls;second, we are working through the early ramp of inefï¬?ciencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell production factories; third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavilytowards Model Y , which carries a slight cost premium to Model 3.Partially offsetting these impacts, we've continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions,in line with the progress we've made in prior years. These improvements include our continuedwork to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles.

Long term, we expect these -- the valueof these credits to be very signiï¬?cant. You can do the math. If we were to get anywhere near 1,000gigawatt-hours of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very signiï¬?cant. So -- butthe credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing. And in the case of Panasonic domesticmanufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits. So it will -- the value of credits this year willnot be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic. We think it probably will be very signiï¬?cant in thefuture.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we're expecting in terms of impact to Tesla forthis year. So different products, we think, will get different amounts of credit. The regulations hereare still in ï¬?ux and there continues to be updates, so this is just our best understanding at themoment. But we think on the order of $150 million to $250 million per quarter this year andgrowing over the course of the year as our volumes grow.And part of the work we're doing here, which is part of what this incentive package is trying toincentivize, is, as Elon mentioned, to move more manufacturing onshore in the United States, whichis Tesla's plans anyways. And so I think we're pretty well positioned over the coming years to takeadvantage of this.But then also part of what the goal of this incentive package is, is to improve adoption from ourcustomers.

2023-01-25,"The next question from investors is, after recent price cuts, analysts releasedexpectations that Tesla automotive gross margin, excluding leasing and credits, will drop below20% and average selling price around $47,000 across all models. Where do you see average sellingprice and gross margins after the price cuts?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, go ahead, Zach.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes, I'll jump in on this. So there is certainly a lot of uncertainty about how the year will unfold, butI'll share what's in our current forecast for a moment. So based upon these metrics here, we believethat we'll be above both of the metrics that are stated in the question, so 20% automotive grossmargin, excluding leases and credits, and then $47,000 ASP across all models.And so 2 other comments I want to make on this, just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4to Q1. And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in conï¬?guratorprices. As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we're delivering cars to at a lower price book giventhat backlogs had been so long for so much of 2022. But then also, there are various programs inplace that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs.The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we're most focusedon what our operating margin is. And so as other areas of the business become more important,particularly the energy business, which is growing faster than the vehicle business, and as we'reheavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efï¬?ciency of our overheads, we think theright metric for us to be focused on is operating margin. And so I wanted to make sure that I sharedthat with the investor community as well because that is what we're primarily managing to now.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand but I think a lot ofothers maybe don't is that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploadingsoftware, to have full self-driving enabled, and full self-driving is obviously getting better veryrapidly. So that's actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a fewexceptions -- I mean only a small percentage of cars don't have Hardware 3.So that means that there's millions of cars where full self-driving can be sold at essentially 100%gross margin.","Elon R.

Zach, when do you think Tesla Insurance will becomebig enough revenue source to warrant providing more details in the ï¬?nancials of the business soinvestors can compare it to other insurance companies?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. I think it's probably going to take some time before this business is large enough for speciï¬?cï¬?nancial disclosures. But I'm happy to provide an update on where we stand in the business. Sowe're currently at a $300 million annual premium run rate as of the end of last year. We're growing20% a quarter so it's growing faster than the growth in our vehicle business.And in the states in which we're operating, on average, 17% of the customers in the states are usinga Tesla Insurance product. And that number continues to tick up as we spend more time in markets.And we see most of the adoption occurring when folks take delivery of a new car, as they're settingup insurance for the ï¬?rst time as opposed to going back and switching when they already haveinsurance set up. So there's an inherent stickiness in the Insurance business.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorNo, go ahead.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFONo, I was just going to say, just as a broader reminder on kind of the motivation for starting thisbusiness, it was to improve and still is to improve the total cost of ownership of our cars, given thatwe're seeing high premiums of insurance from third-party companies. And that remains our priorityhere. We'll obviously run this as a healthy business, but we want to make sure we keep our costslow and insurance stays affordable to our customers.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. And so there are 2 really important side beneï¬?t to our Tesla Insurance that are worthmentioning, one of which Zach alluded to, which is that just by Tesla operating insurance for ourcars at a competitive rate, that makes the other car insurance companies offer better rates for Teslas.So it has a bigger effect than you think because it improves total cost -- or insurance costs evenwhen they don't use Tesla Insurance, because now the [gigas] of the world have to compete withTesla and cannot charge outrageous insurance for Teslas.

2023-01-25,"So it has an ampliï¬?ed effect,very important.Then it is also giving us a good feedback loop into minimizing the cost of repair of Teslas for allTeslas worldwide, because we obviously want to minimize the cost of repairing a Tesla if it's in acollision and for Tesla Insurance. And previously, we didn't actually have good insight into thatbecause the other insurance companies would cover the cost. And actually, the cost, in some cases,were unreasonably high.So we've actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car tominimize the cost of repair, obviously minimize -- ï¬?rst, the best repair is no repair, avoid theaccident entirely, which since every Tesla comes with the most advanced active safety in the world,whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the intelligence of full self-driving for activesafety, active collision prevention. So it's giving us this really good feedback for, again, reducingcost -- total cost of ownership and also just ï¬?guring out how to get -- if somebody's car is in anaccident -- most accidents are actually small. They're like a broken fender or scratched side of thecar or something like, the vast majority of accidents.But we're actually solving how to get somebody's car repaired very quickly and efï¬?ciently and backin their hands. And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars. And we'remaking -- just to emphasize another key point because some of these points might be [less], so Iapologize for being repetitive.But it's remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviouslyimproving the logistics of spare part -- providing spare parts needed for collision repair have anenormous effect on the repair cost. So if you're waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takesa month, now you've got a month of having to rent another car. It's extremely expensive.

And I think input cost, all that stuff isnormalizing, is that like -- and that would be like a kind of like a 10% decline in the COGS per car.Is that something we can hope to see this year or is that too optimistic?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOThe Austin and Berlin ramp inefï¬?ciencies in 4680 will make a substantial amount of progress onthat over the course of the year, and that's within Tesla's control. We're doing a lot of work on costreduction outside of that. And we talked about supply chain costs, expedites, logistics, attackingeverything.On the raw materials and inï¬?ation side, where lithium is the large driver there and this was ameaningful source of cost increase for us, we'll have to see where lithium prices go. And we're notfully exposed to lithium prices, but I think in general, as what we've seen from our forecast here,cost per car of lithium in 2023 will be higher than 2022. So that's a headwind that would have to beovercome to return back to those levels. So I don't think we'll get there this year, but I think we'llmake progress. And we'll continue to ï¬?nd ways to offset these raw material costs that we don't havecontrol over.(inaudible), is there anything on that?Unidentiï¬?ed Company Representative -Yes. Like on the non-cells raw material, we begin to capture beneï¬?ts of indexes tapering out, butdue to the length of various supply chains, it does take time before this is reï¬?ected in our ï¬?nancials.And while aluminum is down like 20% year-over-year, steel is about 30% down year-over-year, theglobal non-cells raw materials market continues to be inï¬?uenced by geopolitical situations inEurope, high production cost due to labor cost increases and energy spikes and disruptions due tonatural disasters like typhoon in Korea 4 months ago, pandemic lockdowns.So we believe that meaningful price corrections will ultimately come, but it remains uncertainexactly when.","Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOThe Austin and Berlin ramp inefï¬?ciencies in 4680 will make a substantial amount of progress onthat over the course of the year, and that's within Tesla's control.

And we're gathering alot of data out of that ï¬?eet to understand how we can sort of bring some margin that we didn't knowwe had out of the product. So over the course of 2023, on the powertrain side, we're actually goingto go after sort of some materials where we're paying for more performance than we need or wehave more content than we need without impacting reliability at all.

2023-04-19,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast. My name isMartin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhornand a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Timein the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has someopening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you, Martin. So just a Q1 recap. Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind inEurope and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United States. And this is in spite of a lot ofchallenges in production and delivery, so it's a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving thesegreat results. The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain. Idon't think I'm telling anyone anything people don't already know, especially with large purchasessuch as cars.And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it's worth noting that our operating marginremains among the best in the industry. We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and alarger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin. However, we expectour vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy. So we dobelieve we're like laying the groundwork here, and that it's better to ship a large number of cars at alower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy. This isan extremely important point.Let's see. Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on ourpilot line for testing purposes. It's a great product, and we're completing the installation of thevolume production line at Giga Texas, and we're anticipating having delivery event, a great deliveryevent probably in Q3.As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and thenaccelerates. So the Cybertruck is no different. So it's -- there's tremendous amount of demand forthe product, obviously.","Elon Musk: Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind inEurope.

2023-04-19,"And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer. But as with all newproducts, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going. And this is, really, a very radicalproduct. It's not made in the way that other cars are made.So let's see, with regards to Megapack, we're making great progress. Our energy storagedeployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1. This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever. Andthis growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Megafactory in Lathrop, California. There's still some way to go to reach the full run rates of 40 gigawatt hours per year. And then weadditionally announced the start of a new Megafactory in Shanghai. So we're -- as we've expected,the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. We've now crossed over 150 million miles driven byFull Self-Driving beta, and this number is growing exponentially. We're -- I mean, this is a dataadvantage that really no one else has. Those who understand AI will understand the importance ofdata -- of training data and how fundamental that is to achieving an incredible outcome.So yes, so we're also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of themain limiting factors of achieving full autonomy. So we're continuing to simultaneously makesignificant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort into Dojo, which we believehas the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training. And it also -- Dojoalso has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in thesame way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.So I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.In conclusion, we're taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further,and we'll continue to invest in growth as fast as possible. Once again, I'd like to give a huge thanksto all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again. And yes, superappreciated.","Our energy storagedeployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1. This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.

2023-04-19,"Thank you very much. And Zach has some remarks as well.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOThanks, Martin. I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production anddeliveries. And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.There are 3 main points I want to make. First, automotive gross margin and operating marginreduced sequentially. But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels. In particular,automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earningscall, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehiclepricing and onetime items, most notably, warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well asincreased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot features as we transition technologies.Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics andthe beginnings of some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized. Per unit cost for Austinand Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes. However, these factories still provide amargin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and stabilize at our intendedvolumes.Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balancedmix of build and deliveries. As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries andproduction within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter andhas an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows. This was particularly prevalent in Q1for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years ofinvestment and focus. This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company'srevenue and reached its highest level yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for ourMegapack products. We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highestgross profit yet in the quarter.Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we're operating the business this year. Ourapproach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses. Weplan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, in-house cell production, energy storage business and our Autonomy and AI-enabled products.","Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOThanks, Martin.

2023-04-19,"Thank you. The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto? Andwhen will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, I should just clarify, like, bigger than auto from the standpoint of, like, total gigawatt hoursdeployed. So it's possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours, I think, will beprobably higher with stationary storage. If you just look at the -- what's needed to transition theworld to a sustainable energy economy, there is more stationary energy storage needed than there ismobile energy storage. So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess ofautomotive, so that is in line with expectations.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with thenext question, which is on guidance for margins, just have a single comment there. I think we are --we will get to the point where we, as a company, provide guidance on the storage business.I say storage as a combination of both the Megapack business and the Powerwall business. Relativeto total revenues of the company, it's still fairly small. And the business has a lot of volatilitycurrently, both in terms of volumes as well as financials, just given the small volumes and kind ofdiversification of the customer pool there.But as this business grows and smooths out, I don't think we're that far away from it. I thinkincluding these volumes on our day 2 production and deliveries release is something that we'll startdoing and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the comingyear. I think it'll be a few more quarters before we get there.","The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto?

2023-04-19,"Thank you. The next question is, how well are 4680 cells meeting the expectations described on theBattery Day? How long will it be until the cells meet those goals? Drew?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. So on Battery Day, we established a cost-down roadmap through 2026 across 5 areas of effort.There was the cell design we discussed, anode and cathode materials, the structural pack conceptand the cell factory itself, and we've been making progress across all of these aspects since then.For the cell factory, the Texas 4680 factory, we are partway through building and commissioningand selling and operating, will be 70% lower CapEx per gigawatt hour than typical cell factorieswhen fully ramped, in line with what we described on Battery Day. And we're continuing to furtherpursue densification and investment reduction opportunities in future factory build-outs like inNevada. On the cell design, we're in production with not only the first generation tabless cell weunveiled in Battery Day, but a second more manufacturer version in Texas today.On the cathode materials side, we have a number of activities underway per the Battery Dayroadmap. For lithium, our Corpus Christi Lithium refinery breaks ground this May. Our goal is tostart commissioning portions of the facility before the end of the year. The refinery uses the sulfate-free spodumene refining process with reduced process costs, no acid or caustic reagents, lowerembodied energy. It actually produces a beneficial byproduct that can be repurposed in constructionmaterials. We discussed all of these concepts on Battery Day.Same with cathode precursor, we've successfully demonstrated lower process cost, zero-waste waterprecursor process that we described on Battery Day at both lab and pilot scale and are in thedetailed design phase for incorporating this technology into the front end of our Austin cathodefacility.On cathode production, we are 50% equipment and 75% utilities installed at our new cathodebuilding in Austin with our goal to begin dry and wet commissioning this quarter and next quarterwith a target to produce first material before the end of the year.Structural pack, we saw big improvements with pack manufacturing with the 4680 cell and thestructural pack concept, 50% lower CapEx and 66% smaller factory for the same output in gigawatthours per year. We do believe structural as a concept is a good one. It's simpler.","On Battery Day, we established a cost-down roadmap through 2026 across 5 areas of effort.

2023-04-19,"Thank you very much. The next question is, what do you anticipate 2023 automotive gross marginsex credits will be at the company's current pricing levels?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes, I can start off on this one. This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this. There'sa lot of macro uncertainty. There are also headwinds and tailwinds. And this is basically a question,I think, that's asking about viewpoint and where costs will go. And within costs, there's a set ofcosts in which we do control the set of costs in which we're kind of subject to what's going on in themacro world.Within the bucket of things we control, the most of the cost down that we're working on is aroundramping our Austin factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we getto our intended volumes there. And a part of the cost journey in the Austin factory is, as Drewmentioned, the 4680 cells, which is an input into our Austin COGS. And so as the 4680 programimproves over the course of the year on cost, as Drew mentioned, and then the noncell portion ofthe factory improves, we see a pretty good trajectory in the Austin facility.A similar story exists in the Berlin factory. It does not have 4680 as an input, but for that factory, thejourney to complete localization is still ongoing. And so over the course of this year, as volumeincreases, more localization occurs, we do see a good path to cost reduction in the Berlin factory aswell. In existing factories, too, we talk about this on every call, so I don't need to rehash it, but theexpectation is that every existing factory improves all of their key metrics, and we continue to seethe progress there.There's also a handful of other costs in which we have influence, but the philosophy here is thatwe're aggressively going across every cost bucket that we can.","The most of the cost down that we're working on is aroundramping our Austin factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we getto our intended volumes there.

So first question was on Lathrop. Obviously, that's -- it's great to see the growththere. Just wondering when you think that facility might be closer to full utilization? Are you justsort of deliberately working your way up the S curve there? Demand, obviously, isn't the limitation.So what are what are the steps, I guess, to unlocking full utilization there?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSure. There are some classic factory ramp aspects of what's going on in Lathrop. We actually had 2phases of the CapEx there, replaced some of the general assembly parts of the facility. But inaddition, we also have ramps with our suppliers that we are following, so both on the sell side andon the power electronics side. And we will see that unlock in the latter half of this year with -- aswell as those inputs. So the overall facility was phased with the second phase of CapEx coming upon towards the end of this year.Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior ResearchAnalystOkay. Great. And then I guess my second question is on your ability to serve other markets out ofShanghai. Obviously, the facility in Berlin should be opening up your ability to, I guess, allocatemore vehicles to Southeast Asia, Australia, other areas. I'm just wondering what other regions doyou think you're maybe not yet serving effectively. What are your time lines for addressing some ofthose gaps in your regional exposure?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. That's a good question, because there are still many parts of the world that we do not yet servewith respect to vehicles especially. So we do expect to open up new markets around the world. Andwhile those markets are not necessarily individually gigantic, they do add up a whole bunch ofmarkets. They do collectively sum up to something significant. So it's high time that Tesla offerthese cars to the rest of the world, and that is something that we intend to do.","Elon R.

Let's go to the next analyst, George from Canaccord.George Gianarikas - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - AnalystI was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you've seen anysignificant positive or negative change there? And also, given that you've reduced the prices foryour vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, to kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it's a tricky pricing questionbecause the value of a car that is autonomous is enormous. So in a way, the price right now is anoption value on an autonomous vehicle. And that value is -- will ultimately be very significant. Andit's really -- yes, I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I mean, you can see theimprovements are really quite dramatic. There'll be a little bit of 2 steps forward, 1 step backbetween releases for those trying the beta. But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving,towards full autonomy.

2023-04-19,"- SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringThe only thing I would say on the, like, EV materials markets. They're not all super liquid and someof them, for example, like, less than -- like, single-digit percentage of the market is actually tradedon the spot market. And not only are they not super liquid, there's not -- like, storage isn'tparticularly facile for all of materials. So, like, small mismatches in supply and demand drive, likelarge price swings, not really -- real price swings, but just like temporarily large price swings. So it'shard to read into those price wings. I don't know, Karn, if you want to add anything.Karn Budhiraj -Yes. Well, this is Karn, by the way. We are seeing, as Elon mentioned, quite a bit of softening in thelithium carbonate market. This was -- 6 months ago, we were trading at like $85,000 a ton, andtoday's spot price is about 26%. So there's been a dramatic decrease in that. Of course, we were ableto take advantage of low lithium pricing earlier on with fixed-price contracts. And we find that thisis going to be another opportunity -- opportune moment to basically extend that into the later half ofthe decade.But we -- at the quantities we're procuring, we're not as impacted by the spot market because wehave all those contracts in place, and we're just going to be going and doing more of that. The otherthing that's happening is because of the price spike. A lot of the companies that are in this businessare becoming more ambitious about finding more upstream resources and exploring locations inAfrica as well as South America. So that's also helping the macro situation with pricing.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. But just on the lithium front, to emphasize, the choke point is more -- much more on refiningcapacity than it is on mining. Lithium is actually -- is very common throughout the world, includingin the U.S. and, really, it's just a very common element on earth. It's lithium. So it's much more aquestion of where is the refining capacity and can the refining capacity keep up. That's really whatmatters more than where is the lithium ore. It's everywhere basically.I think that same question also extends to refining of the cathode, and to some degree, refining ofthe anode.","Elon R.

2023-04-19,"Yes, we can. Yes.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystMaybe a first question for Elon, on your pricing strategy. So if I understand your message, you'resaying Tesla feels it's worth maximizing the volume, increasing the size of the fleet as fast as youcan because you'll be able to monetize this over the life cycle of the vehicle. Could you be a littlebit more specific around ways you would be able to monetize sort of, like, this existing fleet in thefuture? Obviously, I think Autonomous seems to be a big piece of it, but my understanding was thatrobotaxi would probably be for the next-generation vehicle, not the existing one? So I guess inwhich ways would you monetize it?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSorry, the robotaxi terminology can be a bit confusing, because that's sort of like a generic term forour next-generation vehicle. And we obviously are working on next-generation vehicle. That'sgoing to be very compelling. This is just not the time to talk about it in details, the product. So weinternally call it robotaxi.But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware 3, which is the vast majority of our fleet, webelieve will achieve full autonomy. So there will be a -- like, a Model 3 or Model Y would be arobotaxi, a robotic taxi. So yes, that's -- to the best of my knowledge that -- we believe the currenthardware can achieve full autonomy.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystUnderstood. And then maybe a question for Zach. Back on the automotive gross margins. So Ithink, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that 20%automotive gross margin was still probably a reasonable floor.Obviously, the macro has gone worse and additional price cuts have happened. Is there anythingelse that has changed in terms of the outlook? Is it just the macro deteriorating? Is it the competitivelandscape? Anything else that's sort of, like, makes you think differently around the full year? Andis there a way, therefore, to frame a floor?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. About half of the miss against that previous conversation last quarter is attributed toadjustments we made in pricing in the second half of the quarter.","Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystMaybe a first question for Elon, on your pricing strategy.

2023-04-19,"I mean, I guess you could arguethat, that lowers the floor in a sense. We've also made pricing adjustments so far this quarter. So thatbrings it down further.About the other half of the miss in Q1 was attributed to things that are nonrecurring. So I mentionedthese in my opening remarks. It's a warranty adjustment for cars that were previously produced butnot part of the pedigree of cars we're building now and some autopilot-related deferrals as we makesome technology changes here that this deferral should get recognized once some of the softwarecatches up. So those 2 things are nonrepeating. So hopefully, that helps answer your question.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, there are really 2 macro factors that are tricky, the biggest being the interest rate. So ifthere's a very high Fed rate or interest rates are very high, that -- that is -- every time the Fed raisesthe interest rates, that's equivalent to increasing the price of a car. It makes the cars less affordablebecause people are able to buy cars as a function of what they can afford on a monthly basis. Sothat's -- so it's just almost directly equivalent to a price increase is any kind of interest rate increase.Then the other factor is whenever there is uncertainty in the economy, people will generallypostpone new -- big, new capital purchases like a new car. This is natural human reaction. So ifpeople are reading about layoffs and whatnot in the press, they're like, well, they might be worriedabout -- they might be laid off. So then they'll be, naturally, a little more hesitant than they wouldotherwise be to buy a new car. Now this is just the nature of the auto industry. But there is -- therewill be a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for new cars, so -- but it goes through cycles.","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes.

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd we're already starting to see that, Elon, I think you had mentioned before that we anticipated acrash in the lithium prices and some of that has flowed through by way of lithium carbonatereductions into battery cost. And the same thing will happen with lithium hydroxide. The length ofthe supply chain matters also because what we're talking about is very far upstream.So by the time it makes its way into the battery that slip in a car, it'll be several months. But beyondjust commodity pricing, as Zach mentioned earlier, we're also very focused on other metrics thatmake production very efficient. So for example, detention and demurrage, error expedites.

2023-04-19,"Thank you. The next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.Mark Trevor Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity AnalystDo you still see 2 million units as an upside case for volume this year? And is the gating factor forreaching 1.8 million or 2 million units in 2023's supply chain, as was mentioned on your lastconference call? Or is it more about demand at this point?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, if you have a crystal ball you can lend me, back to the crystal ball situation. These are volatiletimes. From a production standpoint, if things go well, we've got a shot at 2 million vehicles thisyear. But that is an upside case. And we feel comfortable with 1.8 million. And we'll just have tosee how this year unfolds.Mark Trevor Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity AnalystThat's helpful.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorDrew, do you want to take that?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. So as you may have seen, we opened our V4 post in Europe and our Magic Dock post in NorthAmerica in Q1, and that is indicative of the direction we're heading with universal compatibility forall vehicles, no matter where the charge port, et cetera, in all major markets, and we're going tocontinue to roll out those sort of improved offerings as we build new stations.We're always balancing, like, our ability to serve our own customers with our ability to serve newcustomers when doing that. I think we've been able to balance it rather well. For example, inEurope, 50% of all of our supercharging stations are open to all EVs, and we've been able to do thatwithout any increase in wait times at all for anybody. So we're going to continue to take a similarapproach as we do this in North America and China over the coming quarters.","Elon R.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think we may have answered this question or tried to answer this question a few times. But it'sdifficult to say what the margin will be. It depends on what the macroeconomic environment is like.So for example, if the Fed were to lower the rates, that would be super helpful for demand. If theyraise them, that just raises the interest costs that buyers have to pay for to buy a car. So it reducesaffordability and therefore, reduces demand.So it's -- but if -- like, if we look past, say, this year or, like, go sometime next year, middle of nextyear, so I think things are looking really -- I think, like I said, we'll weather through if there aresome major geopolitical wildcard that turns up.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, I mean, there are -- since we're always going to have some growing pains where at times --and it depends on which geography we're talking about where sometimes service is behind sales,sometimes it's ahead of sales.

So -- but I think it ishelpful to have the feedback loop with a service, because that means we feel the pain of service, andthen we can adjust the design to make the car need less service. And I think that gives us the rightincentive structure, like, because the best service is no service. The car doesn't break.And whereas if you have, say, a dealer network that is reliant upon services revenue, then youarguably have a misalignment of incentives where they're making money on service.

Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you, Martin. So just a Q2 recap. In Q2, we achieved record vehicle production and deliveriesand record revenue of about $25 billion in a single quarter. And Model Y became the best-sellingvehicle of any kind globally in Q1, surpassing the likes of Corolla and Golf. So it was the #1vehicle of any kind, including vehicles that are sold at a far lower price. This was, I think, anincredible achievement by the Tesla team, and just a huge thank you to our customers for theirsupport.And this came in spite of high interest rates and a lot of macro uncertainty. And nonetheless, wemanaged to achieve operating margin of about 10%. We continue to target 1.8 million vehicledeliveries this year, although we expect that Q3 production will be a little bit down because we'vegot summer shutdowns for a lot of factory upgrades, so just probably a slight decrease in productionin Q3 for sort of global factory upgrades.And the long-term economy we think is going to just drive volume through the ceiling, next level.And our sort of future robotaxi products, the dedicated robotaxi products, we think have a quasi-infinite demand. The way we're going to manufacture the robotaxi is also itself a revolution. And soit's a revolutionary sign made in a revolutionary way. It will be, by far, the highest units per hour ofany vehicle production ever. And I'm so very excited about that.With respect to Autopilot and Dojo, in order to build autonomy, we also need to train our neural netwith data from millions of vehicles.","Tesla's Q2 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time, and the update deck, we published atthe same link as this webcast.

2023-07-19,"The more -- I mean, this has been proven over and over again,the more training data you have, the better the results. And I mean, there are times where we seebasically, in a neural net basically, it's sort of, at a million training examples, it barely works at 2million, it slightly works at 3 million. It's like, ""Wow, okay, we're seeing something."" But then youget to like 10 million training examples, it's like -- it becomes incredible. So there's just nosubstitute for a massive amount of data. And obviously, Tesla has more vehicles on the road that are collecting this data than all other companies combined by, I think, maybe even an order ofmagnitude. So I think we might have 90% of all -- a very big number.So the success in AI and dev is a function of talent, sort of unique data and computing resources.And we have outstanding capabilities in all 3 arenas. And I really just don't know how anyone coulddo what we're doing, even if they had our software and had our computer, if they did not have thetraining data.So speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost ofneural net training. It is designed to -- it's somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need,which is a video training. So we just see that the need for neural net training, again, talking of beinga quasi-infinite of things, is just enormous. So I think having -- we expect to use both NVIDIA andDojo, to be clear. But there's -- we just see a demand for really advanced training resources. And wethink we may reach in-house neural net training capability of 100 [exoblocks] by the end of nextyear.So today, over 300 million miles have been driven using FSD Beta. That 300 million-mile numberis going to seem small very quickly. It will soon be billions of miles, tens of billions of miles.

So it'sthe biggest on the outside, but it's even bigger on the inside. So I think that's -- one of the elementsof good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. And this is no smallcar, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last millimeter.So just trying to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small, and thenreally maximize the utility of the volume. And we can't wait to start delivering it later this year.Some other highlights. Our global Supercharging network now stands at over roughly 50,000connectors and over 5,000 locations. As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla chargingstandard, which we made open source, and it's now called the North American Charging Standard,we're deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use ourconnector and gain access to our charging network. We strongly believe in helping other carcompanies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right thing, in general. So that'sour goal there.Then I think what I want to emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point, is thatTesla, just as with the North American Charging Standard, although we're not licensing -- in thatcase not licensing, we're just making it available. But we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car companies. And we are already in discussions with --only just early discussions with a major OEM about using Tesla FSD. So we're not trying to keepthis to ourselves. We're more than happy to license it to others. And lastly, our new lithium refineryand cathode facility are progressing well.Now in conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can while maintaininghealthy financials. Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era, and we'reincredibly excited about what's to come.","Tesla's global Supercharging network now stands at over roughly 50,000connectors and over 5,000 locations.

2023-07-19,"Thank you very much, Elon. And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. As Elon mentioned, Q2 was another record quarter of production anddeliveries as well as records in profit for energy and services and other businesses. Congratulationsagain to the Tesla team on the continued progress.As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility andconsumer confidence and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach.First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the coretechnologies that will drive the long-term value of the business. These include increasing spendingon AI-related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo; as well as new productssuch as Cybertruck, our next-generation platform, and the Semi, as evidenced by the continuedgrowth in our R&D spend. This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion notonly in our vehicle factories but also our supercharging network service, internal applications andbattery processes as we continue with meaningful capital expenditures to lay this foundation for thefuture.Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both our vehicle andenergy business but, most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue ourpace of R&D and capital investments. This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions ineach of our key businesses as well as working capital improvements on raw materials, work-in-process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction andremained healthy, despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.We recognized -- we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, includingmaterial cost and commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidlyincrease the build rate in our Austin and Berlin factories. For our Energy business, we improvedmargins and gross profit driven by cost reductions in deal economics, particularly with Megapack.As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects andtheir specific revenue recognition milestones.As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon's comments on Q3 volumesdriven by planned downtimes for factory upgrades. These upgrades will also carry some amount offactory idle cost. However, we are working to minimize as much as possible.","Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes.

And let's go to investor questions. The first question on licensing FSD,we've already answered. So let's go to the second one. The second question is, what is the status of4680 cells? How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day? When do you expect toachieve what you laid out on Battery Day?Unidentified Company Representative -Yes. First, I'll just start with a little bit of a production update. So in Texas, 4680 cell productionincreased 80% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed 10 million production cells produced here inTexas. So congrats to the team for that. Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by 40% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a 25% reduction in cell COGS.Here in Texas, we're preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is 10% higher energy densitythan current production. That was accomplished through process and mechanical designoptimization. As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, weshould be in a comfortable place on cost per cell. Against our battery energy density targets, theCyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like electrochemistry basis. We're yet to integratesilicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring significantfurther energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on at Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment,factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texasscale-up to date.","In Texas, 4680 cell production increased 80% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed 10 million production cells produced here inTexas.

2023-07-19,"Thank you very much. The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energyproducts and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model? Given Tesla's AI capabilities,how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software margin fromAutobidder as this segment accelerates?Unidentified Company Representative -We can't comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.Megapack continues to show strong demand globally, with Lathrop ramping successfully to meetour contracted projects in 2023. As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place,in line with our target market -- vehicle target margins.The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathropcapacity ahead of our full factory ramp in 2024. We have several exciting large projects inconstruction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, the Riverina project inAustralia, several projects in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we'll tour today,actually. We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with theseprojects.On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets likeAustralia, Texas, U.K. and California with over 6 gigawatt hours under Tesla's dispatch next year.In the U.K., our projects performed best in the industry in Q2. Autobidder does have softwaremargins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it's a relatively small contributor to revenues givenhow much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring. It's important toremember that this large project -- these large capital projects that have lifetimes of 20 years ofrecurring revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small.On the residential side, we have some fun things happening. We recently surpassed 0.5 millionPowerwalls installed. Just this week, we are launching Charge on Solar, which allows TeslaPowerwall and vehicle customers to charge their vehicles using their excess solar and drive only onthe sunshine that hits their roof. Yesterday, we began paying customers in Texas for participating inour virtual power plant to provide grid support to ERCOT. We expect these credits to lower ourmedian customer's annual bill by 1/3 and to increase these credits over time as ERCOT expandsmarket access.And today, we are expanding Tesla electric enrollment to new Model 3 owners in Texas, followedby all Texas vehicle customers over the rest of the quarter.","Megapack continues to show strong demand globally, with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet contracted projects in 2023.

2023-07-19,"Thank you very much. The next question is, could you quantify the benefits to COGS per unit fromthe IRA battery manufacturing incentives; and secondly, battery raw material declines year-to-date?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOAll right. I can take that. On the first part of the question for IRA manufacturing incentives, weprovided previous guidance that we expect these to be, for the course of this year, in the range of$150 million to $250 million per quarter. We are staying within that foundry as we guidedpreviously, so that was the case in Q2 as well. I will note, and I think we've mentioned this before,that this includes a 50-50 sharing of credits for qualified cells from our long-term battery partner,Panasonic.On the commodity side, we are continuing to see improvements there, as we've discussedpreviously. Lithium is the most notable improvement so far. I think I commented on this on the lastcall because typically, we see this coming about a quarter before. It actually is realized in ourfinancials. And also just as a reminder, we're not fully exposed to the price of lithium. Our supplychain team has done a terrific job in partnership with another -- a bunch of other companies to putin place some long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up and down.We're also seeing benefits in aluminum and steel, which I think is great. Not as large as the lithiumimpacts, but they contribute nonetheless. So if we add up the total impact of this in Q2 relative toprior quarter, it's about the same size and magnitude as the IRA benefits that we also received.Just to put this in context, as you look at COGS per unit sequentially from Q1 to Q2, I think there's2 things to keep in mind there. The first is that our S/X mix for deliveries increased quite a bit fromQ1 to Q2. So as you think about fundamental cost reductions, it's important to adjust for that. Andthen secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin cost, which we did quite abit of that from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above Model Y production costselsewhere. And in the quarter, our mix of Austin- and Berlin-related builds increased.","The next question is, could you quantify the benefits to COGS per unit fromthe IRA battery manufacturing incentives; and secondly, battery raw material declines year-to-date?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOAll right.

As you mentioned, Zach, we've naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium positionbecause of the long-term contracts we have in place. But we have seen reduction in pricing acrossthe board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such as nickel, cobalt and graphite.And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact.

Conceptually, how does Tesladecide when is it appropriate to reduce prices or add other sales incentives to increase demand?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I guess demand has roughly tracked production, which is what we aim for, is we look at --something that we have that really, I think, no other carmaker has is that we have real-time demandand real-time production. Like, so 7 days a week, I get an e-mail -- order-generated e-mail whichshows output from all factories and orders globally. So it's like a real-time finger on the pulse ofearth basically. And we adjust course according to what the mood of the public is. Buying a new caris a big decision for a vast majority of people. So any time there's economic uncertainty, peoplegenerally pause on new car buying at least to see what happens.And then obviously, another challenge is the interest rate environment. As interest rates rise, theaffordability of anything bought with debt decreases, so effectively increasing the price of the car.So when interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car because theinterest payments increased the price of the car. And this is -- at least up until recently, it was, Ibelieve, the sharpest interest rate rise in history. So we had to do something about that.

The reason companies exist is to make goods and services, ideally greatgoods and services. They don't exist for any other reason. They shouldn't.

But I mean, I think we will bespending something north of $1 billion over the next year on -- through the end of next year, it'swell over $1 billion in Dojo. And yes, so I mean we've got a truly staggering amount of video datato do training on. And this is another thing. Like, in order to copy us, you also need to spendbillions of dollars on training compute. I mean it's like -- and it's also hard to. You need the data,and you need the training computers. It's like -- think, all things needed to actually achieve this atscale toward generalized solution for autonomy, this is one of the hottest problems ever. You see alot of AI companies doing LLMs and whatnot. And I'd say, if they're so great, why can't they makea self-driving car? Because it's harder. That's why.But I do think -- that said, I think there's some great AI companies out there. But justfundamentally, the staggering amount of data we've got to process, it's got to be processedsomehow. And custom silicon is the best way to do that. So that's what Dojo is designed to do, isoptimize for video training. It's not optimized for LLMs. It's optimized for video training.

2023-07-19,"Thank you. Let's go to the next analyst. The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from DeutscheBank.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystTwo questions from me as well. First, following up on the autonomy. So before you start launchingthese dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you're improving FSD incrementally. Whatis your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version thatwould trigger much higher take rates? And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of FSD?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me, and perhaps quite fairly have made fun ofme, my predictions about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past. The reasonI've been optimistic, what it tends to look like is we'll make rapid progress with a new version ofFSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically. So at first, logarithmic curve looks like this sort offairly straight upward line, diagonal and up. And so if you extrapolate that, then you have a greatthing. But then because it's actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series ofstacked logarithmic curves.Now I know I'm the boy who cried FSD, but man, I think we'll be better than human by the end ofthis year. That's not to say we're approved by regulators. And I'm saying then that, that would be inthe U.S. because we've got to focus on one market first. But I think we'll be better than human bythe end of this year. I've been wrong in the past, I may be wrong this time. And the price of FSD --so the way to think of the price of FSD is actually very low, it's not high. When you go back to whata singular -- the value of the car increased dramatically if it is actually autonomous. $15,000 isactually a low price, not a high price. And we will offer -- I think we do sort of offer FSD as a sortof monthly subscription. Although, like most people don't know that. So I'd recommend like maybetrying it out as a monthly subscription so you don't have to go with the $15,000 thing. But I thinkyes, obviously, if the car is worth several times its original price, $15,000 is actually a low price forFSD.","Elon Musk: I think we'll be better than human by the end of this year. $15,000 isactually a low price, not a high price.

2023-07-19,"Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.Mark Trevor Delaney - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Research Division - Equity AnalystTesla has been making progress reducing costs and did so again last quarter. Can you give an updateon when you think automotive COGS per vehicle could be under the historical $36,000 per vehiclelevel? And what are the key puts and takes to get there?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOThis is -- I think I was asked this in the past. This is very difficult to forecast. There's a series ofcosts that we manage, the series of cost in which we don't control. And so particularly on thecommodity side, where labor cost go, et cetera, it's just hard to say.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. And we saw very inflationary -- like strong inflationary pressures for a while last year, and now-- which obviously makes it very difficult to reduce COGS. And now we're seeing what seems to bedeflationary pressures, certainly deflationary -- deflation isn't pressure. But we're seeing commodityprices dropping as was mentioned -- as Karn mentioned a moment ago. And look, I mean what doyou think? I mean, basically, the trends seem to be deflationary at the commodity level.Karn Budhiraj -Definitely. There's that, and then there's also the unit economics improve as volumes grow. That'sthe other thing we're seeing. As we're becoming a bigger and better part of a lot of suppliers, theeconomies of scale come into play. There's equipment depreciation that comes into play. Equipmentthat was commissioned 5 to 7 years ago, that used to be a part of the piece price, that's completelyamortized. So we'll see situations where the piece price comes down because that equipmentcontribution has gone away. And then just as we continue to have this mentality of continuousimprovement in terms of labor, reducing labor, improving automation, and just continue to getbetter at what we do. So we have seen -- I think every quarter, we have seen an improvement. Ofcourse, the commodities spike up and down.

My name isMartin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja and anumber of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in theupdate that we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss ourbusiness outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on ourpredictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to anumber of risks and uncertainties including those mentioned in our most recent filings with theSEC.During the question and answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and onefollowup. But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some openingremarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. So just a Q3 recap. Our last quarter was impacted by down time for global factoryupgrades that will help us reduce cost per vehicle as well as increase production. We remainfocused on 3 main objectives which is the cost reduction of our products, investments in artificialintelligence, and other growth projects like Optimus. And continued free cash flow generation.Regarding vehicle cost, our team was able to reduce the cost per vehicle further in Q3 despiteheadwinds from factory idle costs and ramp-up of new factories, and we believe there's stillmeaningful room for improvement there.Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicle has now driven over 0.5 billion miles with FSD Beta, FullSelf-Driving Beta, and that number is growing rapidly. We recently completed a 10,000 GPUcluster of H100s. We think probably bringing it into operation faster than anyone's ever brought thatmuch compute per unit time into production since training is the fundamental limiting factor onprogress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.We're also seeing significant promise with FSD Version 12. This is the end-to-end AI where it's aphoton count in, controls out or really you can think of it as there's just a large bit stream coming inand a tiny bit stream going out, compressing reality into a very small set of outputs, which isactually kind of how humans work. The vast majority of human data input is optics, right from oureyes. And so we are, like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in themiddle.","Tesla's Q3 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update that we published at the same link as this webcast.

2023-10-18,"It's really interesting to think about that.We will continue to invest significantly in AI development as this is really the massive gamechanger, and I mean, success in this regard, in the long term, I think, has the potential to make Teslathe most valuable company in the world by far. If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fullyautonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it's not clear what the limit is.Regarding Energy Storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy, of storage products in Q3. And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest-margin business. Energy andservice now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about Cybertruck, I am too. I've driven the car.It's an amazing product. I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reachingvolume production with the Cybertruck and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive. This issimply normal for -- when you've got a product with a lot of new technology or any new -- brand-new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, youwill have problems proportionate to how many new things you're trying to solve at scale. So I justwant to emphasize that, one, I think this is potentially our best product ever, and I think it is our bestproduct ever. It is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cashflow positive at a price that people can afford.Often, people do not understand what is truly hard. That's why I say prototypes are easy, productionis hard. People think it's the idea or you make a prototype, you design a car. And as soon asdesigning a car is -- it's not just anyone can do it. It does require taste. It does require effort todesign a prototype. But the difficulty of going from a prototype to volume production is like10,000% harder to get to volume production than to make the prototype in the first place. And thenit is even harder than that to reach positive cash flow. That is why there have not been new car start-ups that have been successful for 100 years apart from Tesla.So I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck. It's a great product.","We will continue to invest significantly in AI development as this is really the massive gamechanger, and I mean, success in this regard, in the long term, I think, has the potential to make Teslathe most valuable company in the world by far.

2023-10-18,"But financially, it willtake, I don't know, a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cash flow contributor. Iwish there was some way for that to be different, but that's my best guess.So really, the demand is off the charts. We have over 1 million people who have reserved the car. Soit's not a demand issue, but we have to make it, and we need to make it at a price that people canafford; insanely difficult things.In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining a positive cash flow,and we continue to target and expect to have around 1.8 million vehicle deliveries, as stated earlierthis year.

Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another recordquarter of profitability in our energy business. Congratulations to the Tesla team for their continuedfocus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, higherinterest rates and shifting consumer sentiment.As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planneddowntimes for our factory upgrades. This was necessary to allow for further factory improvementsand production rate increases. Despite those factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased toapproximately $37,500. We saw sequential decreases in material costs and freight. Reducing thecost of our vehicles is our top priority.On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continue to rise due to Cybertruck prototype buildsand pilot production testing, combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving Optimusand Dojo. We have and will continue to make investments in these areas and hence, our capitalexpenditure and R&D will continue to grow in the near term.However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations.This year itself we have generated operating cash flows of approximately $8.9 billion and free cashflows of approximately $2.3 billion.Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a stand-alone basis, with Energy businessleading the charge primarily from the growth in megabyte deployments. Our Services and Otherbusinesses, on a year-on-year basis, also continued to show positive momentum as we benefit fromour growing fleet.As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate thatmost car buying happens with one or other form of financing. And hence, we also view pricing interms of monthly costs for the customer. And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risensubstantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.We've tried to offset such adjustments via our focus on reducing costs.","Tesla's Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planneddowntimes for our factory upgrades.

And like I said, there's no way around that. If you try to make -- ifwe just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally 200 models that are slightvariations on a theme in the combustion engine world, just distinctions without a difference, thenit's really not that hard. But if you want to do something radical and innovative and somethingreally special like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because there's nothing to copy. You haveto invent it, not just the car but the way to make the car.So the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome.

I am worried about the high interest rate environment that we're in. It's -- I just can'temphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment.And as interest rates rise, the proportion of that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally.So that's -- if interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it's that much harder to -- forpeople to buy the car. They simply can't afford it.So -- and we are tracking, I believe, at this point for Model Y to be the best selling car on earth, notjust in revenue but in unit value. If you compare that to the other vehicles that are #2 and #3 andwhatnot, they cost much less than our car. So we're just hitting the law of large numbers situationshere.I know people want us advertising. We are advertising. I think there is something to be gained onthe advertising front. I don't think it's nothing. But informing people of a car that is great but theycannot afford doesn't really help.

So we're focused on growing ourvolumes in a very cost-efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our options, and we'll beable to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.

And obviously, that same software and approach will enable Optimus to do useful thingsand enable Optimus to learn how to do things simply by looking. So extremely exciting in the longterm.As I've mentioned before, given that the economic output is the number of people timesproductivity, if you no longer have a constraint on people, effectively, you've got a humanoid robotthat can do as much as you'd like, your economy is twice the infinite or infinite for all intents andpurposes. So I don't think anyone is going to do it better than Tesla, not by a long shot. BostonDynamics is impressive, but their robot lacks the brain. They're like the Wizard of Oz or whatever.Yes, lacks the brain. And then you also need to be able to design the humanoid robot in such a waythat it can be mass manufactured. And then at some point, the robots will manufacture the robots.And obviously, we need to make sure that it's a good place for humans in that future. We do notcreate some variance of the Terminator outcome. So we're going to put a lot of effort into localizedcontrol of the humanoid robot. So basically, anyone will be able to shut it off locally, and you can'tchange that even if you put -- like a software update, you can't change that.

What steps is Tesla taking to make thistechnology available outside the U.S.?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, our approach has been to try to get it -- like, the more places we're trying to make it work, theharder the problem is. So the reason we don't do it in all countries simultaneously is that it wouldtake much longer to make it work anywhere at all. So that's why it's currently just North America.And also for most parts of the world, you have to get approval before deploying things, whereas inthe U.S., you can deploy things at risk or at least you can take liability for what you're deploying.So it's a -- whereas most countries require some sort of extensive approval program. So we onlywant to go through that extensive approval program when we think it's kind of ready for prime timein that country.I apologize it's not out in those countries, but we keep finding ways to make it better. And it really --it needs to drive such that it exceeds even the unsupervised, significantly exceeds the probability ofinjury of a human or significantly better, a lower probability of injury than a human by far. I thinkwe're tracking to that point very quickly.Obviously, in the past, I've been overly optimistic about this. The reason I've been overly optimisticis that the progress tends to sort of look like a log curve, which is that you have kind of rapid initialimprovements that if you were to extrapolate that sort of rapid, fairly linear rate of improvement,you get to self-driving quite quickly, but then the rate of improvement curves over logarithmicallyas well as the asymptote. That's now happened several times. I would characterize our progress inreal world AI as a series of stacked log curves. I think that's also true in other parts of AI, like[LOMs] and whatnot, a series of stacked log curves. Each log curve gets higher than the last one.So if we keep stacking them, we keep stacking logs, eventually, we get to FSD.","The more places we're trying to make it work, theharder the problem is.

Should we have a similar anticipation for the ramp of thenext-gen platform? Or is there any reason that we should be maybe more optimistic or pessimisticabout the ramp profile there?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, to be clear, it's not really the third year of production. It's kind of like the 18th monthof production is roughly my guess.

2023-10-18,"Yes.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureI have first like a follow-up question on FSD and pricing and adoption. So I agree with you that asFSD improves, we should see its value increasing. But I guess like the ultimate values of FSD,which is to be able to handle like a robotaxi is not going to necessarily interest everybody, and youhave a bit of a degraded version that would be like a chauffeur service where the car drives byitself, but you still have to be in the car and around. And then there is like the hands-on, eyes-onversion of the service. And I guess, there should be like much lower cost, lower feature kind ofvariance of the service that could have a very large penetration on your installed base and a moreexpensive one that would remain at a lower penetration level. So I'm just wondering if you're takingthat.And last but not least, like the simplest version of FSD available are going to work from a technicalperspective, probably before like the ultimate robotaxi version can work, if ever. And so I'mwondering how you take that into account and how you're thinking like the financial contribution ofFSD over time and whether you could evolve your pricing along that kind of tiers to increaseadoption?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, a fully autonomous vehicle, I think, Pierre, the sort of the economics of an autonomousvehicle are truly astounding in a positive way.

2023-10-18,"- Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorNot at this time.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystOkay. And just as a follow-up, obviously, price is also a driver of demand, but that's obviously nothappening in a vacuum. And you mentioned that -- I think you mentioned at some point during thiscall that you're also maybe hitting the law of large numbers on some of your products. Can you justshare how you're thinking about price elasticity just at this point in this macro environment, and anythoughts along those lines?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think that there's very significant price elasticity. I mean to be totally frank, if our car costs thesame as a Rav4, nobody would buy a Rav4, or at least they're very unlikely to. It's worth noting thata lot of these incentives like the tax credit and whatnot, they're actually very difficult for the averageperson to access because they -- most people do not have $10,000 or even $7,500 burning a hole intheir bank account. A lot of -- a large number of people are living paycheck to paycheck and with alot of debt. They've got credit card debt, mortgage debt. So yes, it's -- that's reality for most people.It's sometimes difficult for people who are high income earners, and when I say high, it'd be likesomeone who's earning over $200,000 a year, to understand what life is like for someone who isearning $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a year, which is most people.So like, for a lot of people, like, this tax credit just -- they can't front $7,500 for 18 months or even 6months to -- for the tax credit, and they actually don't, in some cases even have that [an ancillary$7,500] in taxes. So it's really just the vast regard to people is how much money do they have to payimmediately and how much per month. That's it. You can stop right there. And our car is still muchmore expensive than a Rav4 when you look at it that way.Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOOne other thing which I'll add, when you look at car buying in general, we're trying to get to thenext set of EV adopters.Elon R.

And you mentioned that -- I think you mentioned at some point during thiscall that you're also maybe hitting the law of large numbers on some of your products. Can you justshare how you're thinking about price elasticity just at this point in this macro environment, and anythoughts along those lines? Elon Musk: If our car costs thesame as a Rav4, nobody would buy a Rav 4, or at least they're very unlikely to. It's worth noting thata lot of these incentives like the tax credit and whatnot, they're actually very difficult for the averageperson to access because they -- most people do not have $10,000",0.5763792395591740,0.3627174198627470,0.06090329587459560,Automotive

I'm like -- I mean this is like some real MarieAntoinette vibes from people who say why isn't everyone working from home? Like, what about allthe people that have to come to the factory and pull the cars or all the people that have to go to therestaurant and make your food and deliver your food. It's like what are you talking about you -- Imean, how detached from reality does the work-from-home crowd have to be while they takeadvantage of all those who do -- who cannot work from home? So I mean, you have to say, like,""Why did I sleep in the factory so many times?"" Because it mattered.So I just can't emphasize again how important cost is. It's not an optional thing for most people. It isa necessary thing. We have to make our cars more affordable that people can buy it. And I keepharping on this interest thing, but I mean it just raises the cost of the car. I mean we're looking at itin an internal analysis, which I know we -- we think is more or less on track that when you look atthe cost -- or the price reductions we've made in, say, the Model Y and you compare that to howmuch people's monthly payment has risen due to interest rates, the price of the Model Y is almostunchanged.Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOIf you factor in the changing interest rates.Elon R.

2023-10-18,"It's howmuch money do they have to put down and do they literally have that in their bank account or theircheck balance? And then what is the monthly payment? And it doesn't matter how -- if that monthlypayment is principal interest or whatever, it's just a number, and that number has to not cause theirbank account to go negative.As it -- so going from near 0 interest rates to kind of the current very high interest rates, the actualmonthly payment is basically the same. It's just a bunch more of it is going to interest. And there aresome incremental challenges beyond that, which is the difficulty of getting credit at all hasincreased. And so there are a number of people who simply cannot get credit, period. Even ifthey've got a job and everything is solid, the banks are a little gun-shy on handing out credit giventhat a bunch of them kicked the bucket earlier this year.Andrew D.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIt's like does your bank still exist? Well, if your bank does not exist, you have to establish arelationship with a new bank. And so a lot of regional banks have died, and I mean even CreditSuisse, I mean, geez, that was a shocker. You've got a 160-year-old-ish Swiss institution that doesn'texist anymore. That's mind-blowing. And I think there's still quite a few shoes to drop on the badcredit situation. I mean commercial real estate obviously is in terrible shape. Credit card debt hasbeen rising significantly. The credit card interest rates are usurious. It's over 20% interest rates,meaning like -- which over time just becomes obviously extremely punishing. Because ifsomebody's paying 20% interest on their credit cards, it means they cannot pay them off. And if youcannot pay them off and you're still accruing interest at 20%, you're at best headed to a bad place.","Elon Musk: There are a number of people who simply cannot get credit, period.

2023-10-18,"Thank you. Let's go to next question from George from Canaccord.George Gianarikas - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - AnalystJust to focus on the cost per vehicle coming down in future quarters as you discussed in yourwritten remarks, I'm curious as to what the levers of that could be. Is it more scale, more factoryutilization? Is it material cost reductions? Are there things like Gigacasting? I mean can you justkind of give us some data points to give us confidence that that's going to come down over time?And if I can sneak one in, please, there are press reports, and I know how perilous it is to believesome of these, but they say that you've included radar as an option in some Model Ys in China. AndI'm just here to ask if that's true. And if so, why?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe've not included radar. We have radar as -- a Tesla-designed radar is an experiment in Model Sand X. That's it. We'll see whether that experiment is worth it, but there are no plans to integrateradar into 3 or Y . Just as humans drive well, and in fact, an excellent human driver can drive withamazing safety simply with their eyes, the car will far exceed the average human safety just withvisual, far, far, far. Because, I mean, the car is looking at all directions at once, and we don't haveeyes on the back of our head. So -- and the computer never gets tired and never gets distracted, getdrunk, hopefully.And so radar is -- what really matters is how much does it affect the probability of an accident. Andin order for the radar to be effective, you have to be able to do radar-only braking or you have to doactions that are radar only. Otherwise, you get this disambiguation problem between vision andradar. That's why we actually turned off the radar in cars historically that we had chipped. All 3 andY used to have radar, but we turned it off because the radar actually generated more noise thansignal.","There are no plans to integrateradar into 3 or Y .

2024-01-24,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast. My name isMartin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and anumber of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in theupdate deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some operating remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you. So the Tesla team did an incredible job in 2023. We achieved record production anddeliveries of about 1.8 million vehicles, in line with our official guidance. And in Q4, we wereproducing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost 2 million cars a year. This is really aphenomenal achievement.Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made 560,000 cars. This is a record. In fact, it's thehighest output of automotive plant in North America. And people are often surprised that thehighest output factory -- car factory in North America is in the San Francisco Bay Area. It's a littlecounterintuitive perhaps.And the -- it's really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area. What would have been arun-down strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas. Think about that. It wasderelict when we got it, and now it's the most productive plant in this entire part of the world. Andit's enriched the community in so many different ways. It's really a gem. So I'm super proud of thepeople that work there.Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted, and the best-selling vehicle of anykind, not just electric vehicles, with over 1.2 million units delivered. The Energy Storage businessdelivered nearly 15 gigawatt hours of batteries in 2023 compared to 6.5 gigawatt hours the yearbefore, so tremendous year-over-year growth, triple digits.

2024-01-24,"I said for many years that the storage business will growmuch faster than the car business, and it is doing that.Free cash flow remained strong at $4.4 billion in 2023 in spite of record spending on futureprojects. So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D.This brings us to 2024. There's a lot to look forward to in 2024. Tesla is currently between 2 majorgrowth waves. We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full self-driving and other projects, is executed as well as possible. For fullself-driving, we've released version 12, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to priorversions. This is end-to-end artificial intelligence. So [nothing but] nets basically, photons in andcontrols out.And it really is quite a profound difference. This is currently just with employees and a fewcustomers, but we will be rolling out to all who -- all those -- all customers in U.S. who request fullself-driving in the weeks to come. That's over 400,000 vehicles in North America.So this is the first time AI has been used not just for object perception but for pathfinding andvehicle controls. We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets. It's really quiteremarkable.So as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference.Out of necessity, we've actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardwarebecause hardware 3 at this point is several years old. So I don't -- I think we're quite far ahead ofany other company in the world in terms of AI inference efficiency, which is going to be a veryimportant metric in the future in many arenas.So see, the new Model 3 is now available globally, so we did an update in Model 3. While the carlooks similar, a lot of work has gone into the vehicle to make it better in every way. It issignificantly quieter, more refined, better equipped, has longer range and many other improvements,and I recommend taking it for a test drive. If you have not driven a Model 3 in a long time, youshould really try the new one, so steady improvements.And we're very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle.

2024-01-24,"So there'll not be many questions that try to ask us about new productscoming, but we reserve product announcements for product announcements, not earning calls. So --but we're very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound not just in its design of thevehicle itself but in the design of the manufacturing system. This is a revolutionary manufacturingsystem, significant -- far more advanced than any other automotive manufacturing system in theworld like by a significant margin.Several years ago, I said the -- perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in thefuture will be manufacturing technology. And you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle.The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin,Texas. And then we'll follow that up with other locations around the world, probably our -- thefactory we built in Mexico will be second, and then we'll be looking to identify a third locationperhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America.In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries and a strong free cashflow in spite of a very high interest rate environment. And we are focused on exciting new projectsthat will -- I think, ultimately, if we execute on all these things, and it is very hard to do all thesethings, not a sure thing, but I do see a path where Tesla could 1 day be the most valuable companyin the world. I do want to emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now aset of possible outcomes. And previously, I would not have thought it is a set of possible outcome.So -- and thank you again to all of our investors, our employees and our suppliers for a strong yearand looking forward to a great 2024 and years to come.

And we are focused on exciting new projectsthat will -- I think, ultimately, if we execute on all these things, and it is very hard to do all thesethings, not a sure thing, but I do see a path where Tesla could 1 day be the most valuable companyin theworld.",0.01932648755609990,0.07651027292013170,0.9041632413864140,Automotive
2024-01-24,"Thank you, and our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOThanks, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone. As Elon mentioned, we had a record year in terms ofboth production and deliveries for our auto business as well as record deployments in our energybusiness. This was achieved despite 2023 being a challenging year in terms of higher interest ratesand higher inflation. Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period. Iwould also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout.In terms of our 2023 financials, we ended the year with over $96 billion of revenue and generated$4.4 billion of free cash flow to end the year with over $29 billion of cash and investments on hand.Our 2023 GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of onetime noncash benefit of $5.9billion from the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. This was due to ourrecent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have recentlygone through a similar change in their accounting.Accordingly, starting with Q1, our booked tax rate will now be more in line with other companies inthe S&P 500. In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despiteus being in the early phase of Cybertruck era. As a result, our auto gross margin improvedsequentially. That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are manymoving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control, like the change in tariffs orlocal incentives, to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approachingthe limits within our current platforms.On the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in 2023. We fullyappreciate the importance of customer education as we are still in the customer acquisition phase.Our data suggests that around 90% of our vehicle buyers in 2023 never owned a Tesla before. Weare being creative in figuring out ways to bring in new customers and educate them about thebenefits of owning a Tesla versus gas-powered vehicles, the key among them being total cost ofownership. This concept is mostly overlooked for just the upfront cost.","Thanks, Elon.

First, forcustomers who qualify for buyer credit, we now offer that as a point-of-sale benefit for Model Y ,which means an immediate reduction of $7,500 at the time of purchase to the end customer.Secondly, we continue to offer very attractive lease rates for Model 3 and Y using our partnerleasing program.

2024-01-24,"Thank you, and let's go through investor questions. Question #1 is from Michael. Given that youmoved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the time lineimproved so that we might see the next-generation platform vehicles in 2025?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe -- I mean I won't certainly say things with -- that should be taken with a grain of salt since I'moften optimistic. But I don't want to blow your mind, but I'm often optimistic regarding time. Butour current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025, sometime in thesecond half. That's just what our current schedule says. There's a lot of new technology, like atremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here.The reason I want to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because wereally need the engineers to be living on the line. This is not sort of off-the-shelf, just works type ofthing. And it's just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live on the line if it's in Austin versuselsewhere. So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half of next year. Thatwill be a challenging production ramp. Like I can't emphasize, we'll be sleeping on the linepractically. In fact, not practically, we will be.But I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any othermanufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world. It's next level. So it's always difficultto predict what that S curve of manufacturing looks like. It always starts off real slow, and then itgrows exponentially. So -- and predicting that intermediate S curve is difficult but -- so I don'tknow. It's hard to say what the unit volume would be next year. We're not going to make anypredictions on that front, but it does seem quite likely that we will start production next year.","Elon Musk: We are currently expecting to start production second half of next year.

Drew?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. First, I just want to allay any concerns regarding 4680 limiting the Cybertruck ramp becauseI've seen some people commenting about that. Today, 4680 production is ahead of the ramp withactually weeks of finished cell inventory. And the goal is to keep it that way not only for Cyber butfor our future vehicle programs.

And as with any major new product introduction, the factory andengineering teams collaborated to ensure quality of the new design and the process changes as theirfirst priority. And now our focus returns to cost and production ramp in Q1.And in terms of what we're doing, we're currently running 1 production line, 1 assembly line, using2 assembly lines in addition for yield and rate improvement trials, and we have a fourth incommissioning, and 4 more will be installed starting in Q3 this year.

The target of these tests is really just to drive awareness and ultimately measure the returnon investment on those digital channels.And the messaging we're driving is really focused on our product and also try to address some ofthe misconception of the EV , such as safety, affordability.

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOkay. Well, it's really tough to find the unmute button on Teams, guys. I'm sorry for being late. Soyes, my question would be on like the cost reduction. You've talked about it already a lot. And if Ilook at it over the last like 5, 6 quarters on average, the COGS per car has been coming down likemore than 2% sequentially on average. So that means you are like on a trajectory of COGS per cargoing down 10% a year. So that's probably like unheard of in the auto industry. I don't think any carmanufacturer ever achieved that.But that's very, very mundane and very -- it's a good performance, but it's a very normalperformance in a lot of other manufacturing industry like microelectronics or consumer electronics.And so I'd love to hear your thoughts about whether you consider yourself closer to the latter, tolike a microelectronics business, where you have this ability to actually always improve costs, youhave more control on how things are pulled together into your cars, and you see yourselfsustainably taking costs down with that kind of pace. Or do you think your ability to take down costis actually going to become more like in line with the rest in the industry over time?Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOYes. I think I've covered this in a pretty lengthy detail even in my opening remarks and in aprevious question, but to just further clarify, we are constantly looking for what we can do to reducecosts. Like I said, it's a game of pennies. We've talked about it before as well. And the team isconstantly going and checking where can we reduce the cost further. And do I believe that we willhave the same pace which you've seen over the past few years? Probably not because, remember,we were coming out with a period wherein commodity prices were rising. So then we did seebenefits coming from that.So those are more or less taken care of, but there is more, which we're still chasing.","The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from NewStreet Research.

2024-01-24,"Yes, GPU's a funny word, like vestigial.So -- and a lot of our progress in self-driving is training limited. Something that's important withtraining, it's much like a human. The more effort you put into training, the less effort you need ininference. So just like a person, if you train in a subject, sort of class, 10,000 hours, the less mentaleffort it takes to do something. If you remember when you first started to drive how much of yourmental capacity it took to drive, it was -- you had to be focused completely on driving. And afteryou've been driving for many years, it only takes a little bit of your mind to drive, and you can thinkabout other things and still drive safely.So the more training you do, the more efficient it is at the inference level. So we do need a lot oftraining. And we're pursuing the dual path of NVIDIA and Dojo, but I would think of Dojo as along shot. It's a long shot worth taking because the payoff is potentially very high but it's notsomething that is a high probability. It's not like a sure thing at all. It's a high risk, high payoffprogram.

It has the potential for something special. There's also our inference hardwarein the car, so we're now on what's called Hardware 4, but it's actually version 2 of the Tesla-designed AI inference chip.And we're about to complete design of -- the terminology is a bit confusing. About to completedesign of Hardware 5, which is actually version 3 of the Tesla-designed chip because the version 1was Mobileye. Version 2 was NVIDIA, and then version 3 was Tesla. So -- and we're makinggigantic improvements from 1 -- from Hardware 3 to 4 to 5.I mean there's a potentially interesting play where when cars are not in use in the future, that the in-car computer can do generalized AI tasks, can run a sort of GPT4 or 3 or something like that.","We're pursuing the dual path of NVIDIA and Dojo, but I would think of Dojo as along shot.

2024-01-24,"Thank you. And the next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.Colin M. Langan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity AnalystAs we're thinking about going into 2024, the press release talks about hitting 36,000 or slightlyabove in Q4. And the comments on the release talk about approaching the [aperture] limits, and itsounds like you're continuing to try to [whittle] that away, but that sort of implies there's not muchleft.In addition, you have the hourly wage increase, I guess, will add to that into next year. And Ithought you said raw material costs are kind of -- that benefit is sort of almost played out. So isthere an opportunity to continue to go below the 36,000? Or should we kind of be modeling that itkind of stays at this level into '24?Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOWe are definitely aware of the cost increases, which are coming through because of the wageincreases. But like I said, we keep looking at other cost opportunities and try and figure out whereelse can we cut down. So there is definitely more opportunity to bring down costs further. I won'tspecifically guide to a number, which we will try and get to, but there's definitely more opportunitythere.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, we're chasing lots of cost opportunities on the design side still for 2024. North of 8 figures iswhat we're -- just in my organization. Lars has got a bunch. And then from a commoditiesperspective, it's such a long cycle time through the whole material supply chain that even with whatwe've already seen to this point, there's more to come on commodities reductions.Unidentified Company Representative -And there's still some tailwind left on the commodities.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringThat's what I mean. Yes.Unidentified Company Representative -Aluminum and steel.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. And battery materials.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIt boggles my mind to think that if we make a 1% improvement in cost, that's $1 billion. So it's like,on average, if we reduce the cost by $0.01, $1 billion. What? I mean we started off not long ago thatwe're only making like 10 cars a week.","Andrew D.

2024-01-24,"Thank you. Colin, do you have a follow-up question?Colin M. Langan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity AnalystYes, just a quick follow-up. In the commentary, you mentioned the taxes would go to the S&P 500level. I think you've been trending slightly below 10%. S&P, I think it's typically 25%-ish. Is thatgoing to -- should we expect that to jump right up next year when we're modeling next year? Orwould it be like a gradual change over the next few years? And any cash impact from that taxchange as well that we should be considering?Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOYes. So there's no impact on cash taxes from the release of the valuation amount, which I spokeabout. What it does is it's how you account for taxes on your books. So it's basically an accountingchange wherein there are certain jurisdictions because we had enough NOLs, et cetera, wherein wedidn't have to accrue book taxes. Now that the valuation allowance has been released and we haverecognized deferred tax assets on the books, that means your tax rate immediately goes up.","Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOYes.
