        "paragraph": "Instructions]\nBut before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nThanks, Martin. So I'll make some opening remarks, and then we're going to talk about vehicle safety,\nAutopilot and factory safety. And we have a number of people from Tesla here to elaborate on that. So I\nthink there's just a lot going on that you would find interesting.\nBut I want to start by thanking all of our customers, employees and shareholders. This was an incredibly\nhistoric quarter for Tesla. Model 3 production stabilized. We delivered a total of 84,000 vehicles globally,\nwhich is more than 80% of vehicles that we delivered in all of 2017. In fact, we delivered more cars in this\nquarter than we did in all of 2016 in a single quarter.\nModel 3 became the best-selling car in the U.S. in terms of revenue and the third best-selling car in terms\nof volume. We saw higher revenues and significantly better profitability in our energy business. I mean, I\nthink with solar, it may have been the best quarter ever for solar. We achieved GAAP net income of over\n$300 million, increased cash and equivalents by $731 million and achieved a greater than 20% gross\nmargin for Model 3.\nAnd moreover, we expect to again have positive net income and cash flow in Q4. And I believe our\naspiration is something that will be for all quarters going forward. I think we can actually be positive cash\nflow and profitable for all quarters going forward, leaving aside the quarters where we may need to do\na significant repayment but -- for example, in Q1 next year. But I think even in Q1, I think we can be\napproximately flat in cash flow by end of quarter.\nThis quarter was made possible by the incredible execution of our employees across the board, from sales,\nproduction, delivery, service, energy, engineering, finance and all of our G&A teams. Really every part\nof the business executed incredibly well. I want to thank everyone again for their incredibly hard work.\nI especially want to thank customers who helped -- it's like I've never even heard of this -- maybe this\nhas happened before, but I've never heard of a case where a company's customers actually cared about\nthe future of the company so much that they volunteered their time to help the company succeed. I think\nthat's amazing. Just -- you don't see that anywhere. So yes, really, chokes me up, actually.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2018 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5This quarter, we started rolling out Version 9 of our software, which is the biggest software upgrade in 3\nyears. And Model 3 received a 5-star safety rating in every category and subcategory. I think that's the\nlowest probability of injury of any car that the U.S. government's ever tested.\nLooking ahead, we expect to produce and sell even more Model 3s in Q4 and expect that trend to continue\ninto Q1. And we're excited to bring Model 3 to Europe and China early next year given that the market for\nmidsized premium sedans in those regions is even larger than in North America.\nI said before that we must prove that Tesla can be sustainably profitable. This quarter was an important\nstep towards that, and I'm incredibly excited about what lies ahead. So this is -- yes, just so, so proud of\nthe Tesla team and our customers. Really appreciate the support of our long-term shareholders. And yes,\nI just want to say on behalf of the Tesla team, we're just super appreciative of your support through what\nhas actually been a very difficult time.\nAll right. Now let's move to -- let's start off with vehicle safety. Madan, who's our lead vehicle safety\nengineer, been with the company for a long time. Madan, how many years has it been that we've been\nworking together?\nMadan Gopal\n10 years.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nEight?\nMadan Gopal\n10 years.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\n10 years. Wow, so yes, I've been working with Madan for 10 years. And we've had so many conversations\non vehicle safety. Wow. And you know what, the -- we're really going to try to go the extra mile with\nvehicle safety, not just -- in fact, there's a series of government-mandated tests, but what some\ncompanies do is they game the system. So they know where the side pole impact is going to be. They\nstrengthen it right in that position. At Tesla, we're like, \"Okay, what is the weakest point in the car? Let us\ntest it at that position.\" So the actual safety is not fully captured in the tests because we anti-game the\nsystem. Madan, if you...\nMadan Gopal\nThank you, Elon. Just to give you a very quick background about myself. So like I said, joined Tesla 10\nyears. I'm extremely very happy to mention I'm working with an extraordinary set of very passionate and\nvery hard-working individuals, and that essentially shows in our product. So that's very important for us.\nAnd also important is our principal mission statement on safety because what we want to do is safety has\nbeen -- is probably the important factor for our vehicle. It's not just for electrical vehicle. Any vehicle,\nperiod. And that fundamentally differentiates us, so -- which essentially helps us to keep adding new\nfeatures and new safety technology. And that's very important and that shows in Model 3. Just the things\nthat we have.\nAlso the fact that we have electric vehicle, the design and architecture uses a fundamental benefit over\ntraditional vehicles. And that takes care of, for example, whether you have a block of engine in the front\nwhere we can work with using pretty much open architecture in the front. And the whole fact that you\nhave all the electrical and high voltage and motors and all of that almost below the central gravity of the\nvehicle, it's the lowest probability of reduced or lower risk, and that significantly benefits.\nElon R. MuskTESLA, INC. FQ3 2018 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. I think architecturally, we have Newton on our side. And having Isaac Newton on your side is\ndefinitely the way to go.\nMadan Gopal\nRight, exactly. So in the latest series of tests, I would like to specifically talk about Model 3. NHTSA did a\nseries of tests, actually 4 tests, for 1 frontal, 2 side and 1 rollover test. And if you look at -- we've been\ncalculating how can we distinguish within the 5 star. There are so many vehicles that already get 5 star.\nAnd if you look at within the 5 star...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nThat is not all the same. Not all the same.\nMadan Gopal\nYes, exactly. So if you look at there, the tricks we came up with, which is a part of U.S. NCAP rating itself,\nas a lowest probability of injury, Model 3 has the lowest. And just to give you a context, there are a total\nof 900-plus vehicles since 2011 which have been rated. So the fact that Model 3 is the best among all the\n943 to be exact. So that speaks to value.\nAnd I'm very happy to say that Model 3 has achieved -- we are not stopping right now. What we would\nlike to do next is how we can make use of the active safety and Autopilot features and make it even more\nimprovement so the next area that we're focusing on, how to integrate active and passive safety. That's\nour next area of challenge, which we will improve for sure.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. And so worth noting that the safety extends to not just people in car but also pedestrians.\nMadan Gopal\nCorrect.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. So not having a big engine block in the front of the car is really helpful so -- because if you -- if the\ncar were to hit a pedestrian, we'll get to active safety next because the best thing is actually not just to hit\ncar or a pedestrian. The fact that the hood can condense so far in is really helpful because it ends up being\nlike a sort of -- sort of like a trampoline or like -- it has -- you just -- you don't have a rock underneath\nthis. That's very helpful.\nSo it's helpful for pedestrian safety and for the safety of people in the car. And then even if you have like a\nhead-on collision with another car, the extended sort of crumple zone of a Tesla Model S, X or 3 is helpful\nto the people in the Tesla and the people in the other car. So it's not just for people in the car.\nMadan Gopal\nI'd like to add one item, which is essentially how we look at the real-world safety, which has always been\nan important element for Elon. So if you look at the -- our blog post, we showed how we handled the\ncentral fall impact in the front hood. By the way, that's not part of NCAP rating. Just to show how we go\nover and above the NCAP rating to make sure it's real world safety. That's very important for us.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectTESLA, INC. FQ3 2018 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7Exactly. That's what I mean by like anti-game the system, like what is the worst way that the car could be\nhit, not just sort of strength and where we know the test will happen and that kind of thing. So obviously,\nwe're all in these cars, our friends are in these cars, family is in the car, so we care a great deal about\nsafety. A lot of people think safety is boring, but not Tesla. So thanks, Madan.\nMadan Gopal\nThank you.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nThank you for your decade of hard work and the rest of Tesla safety team. And with that, let's move on to\nAutopilot and yes, just give an update on sort of Autopilot software, AI and hardware. Yes.\nStuart Bowers\nVice President of Engineering\nThat's great. This is Stuart Bowers. We will soon begin to roll out the team's most advanced Autopilot\nfeature ever, Navigate on Autopilot. In our last release, we launched a new set of neural networks that\ncombined together, provide a view of everything happening around the car.\nWith Navigate on Autopilot, we'll use information to understand exactly where the car is on the highway\nsystem and to automatically change lanes, handle forks and take high-curvature exits to follow a nav\nroute. Initially, it will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn signal before the car moves\ninto an adjacent lane. Future versions will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement if they\nchoose to.\nOne area that I'm personally really excited to build on with this improvement is active safety. With the\nadvancement in neural networks covering 360 degrees of view around our car, we can provide a level of\nconstant vigilance that humans just can't. Ultimately, this should allow us to warn, even intervene, for an\nenormous percentage of modern accidents and to ship these improvements as software upgrades to our\nexisting customers.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nAnd we have a lot of -- we see this all the time in the data where the car will do an automatic braking\nevent and save a pedestrian or another car from impact. This happens all the time.\nStuart Bowers\nVice President of Engineering\nAll the time.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. All the time. Essentially every day. So great [ preview ].\nStuart Bowers\nVice President of Engineering\nYes. The team's done incredible work here. And by bringing more of the cameras around the car, we can\ndetect things as they come toward us, not just directly in front of us.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes.\nPeter BannonTESLA, INC. FQ3 2018 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8Director of Silicon Engineering\nHi, this is Pete Bannon. The Hardware 3 design is continuing to move along. Over the last quarter, we've\ncompleted qualification of the silicon, qualification of the board. We started the manufacturing line and\nqualification of the manufacturing line. We've been validating the provisioning close in the factory. We've\nbuilt test versions of Model S, X and 3 in the factory to validate all the fit and finish all the parts and all\nthe provisioning close. So we still have a lot of work to do, and the team's doing a great job. And we're\nstill on track to have it ready to go by the end of Q1.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nGreat. And that will be roughly 1,000% increase in thrust and capability compared to the current\nhardware. And so it's obviously a giant improvement. Despite being about the -- it costs about the same,\ncost volume, and product consumption are approximately the same as the current hardware. But it's a\ntenfold improvements in frames per second. Yes. And improved redundancy as well.\nBut very importantly, very important to emphasize is that the only -- the thing that needs to change\nbetween the cars produced today and the cars that are produced in the second quarter of next year\nis swapping out the Autopilot computer. And this is a simple change that takes place in half an hour in\nservice to upgrade the computer. And anyone will be able to upgrade their computer to full Self-Driving\ncapability -- upgrade their car to full Self-Driving capability with a simple service visit.\nSo we expect all cars with the Hardware 2 sensor suite, basically anything made in the last roughly 2\nyears will be upgradable to full Self-Driving.\nPeter Bannon\nDirector of Silicon Engineering\nYes. In fact, a lot of the cars we're using for testing today have, in fact, been upgraded from Hardware 2.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nRight. So it's very important to emphasize like people shouldn't -- it's like -- it seems like people want to\nwait until that comes out, but there's no need to wait until that comes out because it's just a very simple\nplug-and-play change to get the full Self-Driving. And anyone who's paid for the full Self-Driving option\nwill just get it done for free. And anyone who still wants to order full Self-Driving at this point, it's just an\noff-menu item. You can still order it, but we took it off the order -- menu just because there are -- it was\nreally creating a lot of friction in the sales process and people didn't understand the difference between\nEnhanced Autopilot and full Self-Driving.\nSo just to simplify the order process, we took that off. But anyone who asks for it can certainly get it.\nAnd it really ends up being a discount on future capability. But to be clear, there's definitely no need to\nwait until Q2 to order a car. It's -- we want to make it just a completely seamless process. So there's no\nadvantage to ordering now versus Q2. Andrej, do you want to...\nAndrej Karpathy\nDirector of Artificial Intelligence & Autopilot Vision\nYes. Thanks. Hi, everyone. I'm Andrej Karpathy, I'm the Director of AI here at Tesla. And my team trains\nall the neural networks that analyze the images streaming in from the all the cameras for the Autopilot.\nFor example, these neural networks identify cars, lane lines, traffic signs and so on.\nThe team is incredibly excited about the upcoming upgrade for the Autopilot computer, which Pete\nbriefly talked about. This upgrade allows us to not just run the current neural networks faster. But more\nimportantly, it will allow us to deploy much larger, computationally more expensive networks to the fleet.\nThe reason this is important is that it is a common finding in the industry, and that we see this as well, is\nthat as you make networks bigger by adding more neurons, the accuracy of all their predictions increasesTESLA, INC. FQ3 2018 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9with the added capacity. So in other words, we are currently at a place where we've trained large neural\nnetworks that work very well but we are not able to deploy them to the fleet due to computational\nconstraints.\nSo all of this will change with the next iteration of the hardware, and it's a massive step improvement in\nthe compute capability. And the team is incredibly excited to get these networks out there.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nGreat. Thank you. And I've said this before, but I think -- let's talk about how we look at the longer-term\nfuture. We absolutely see the future as kind of -- as sort of shared electric autonomy so that you'll be able\nto do ride-hailing or share your car in any way in a sort of long-term model that's some combination of\nlike Uber, Lyft and Airbnb. So there'll be Tesla-dedicated cars for ride-hailing, and there'll be -- and any\ncustomer will be able to share their car at will, just like you share your house in Airbnb.\nSo it's a combination of those 2 models. I think it's pretty obvious where things are headed long term. The\nadvantage that Tesla will have is that we will have millions of cars in the field with full autonomy capability,\nand no one else will have that. So I think that puts us -- that will end up putting us in the strongest\ncompetitive position long term.\nAnd then, Laurie, can you finish off with -- let's talk about factory safety. And thanks for the hard work of\nyou and your team. And I think we've made great strides. And yes, please, please go ahead.\nLaurie Shelby\nVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)\nYes, thanks. We have the safest cars made by the safest people. So it's an exciting time here at Tesla.\nAll car and manufacturing factories have injuries. At Tesla, we have a commitment to 0 injuries. And our\ntarget is actually on good reporting. So we have good reporting of injuries, good reporting of near misses,\ngood observations and lots of improvements. So to be the safest company in the world, we have to be\ncommitted to that. And everybody here is. So we're actually steadily getting there, and we're not going to\nstop until we're there.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nAbsolutely.\nLaurie Shelby\nVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)\nSo one...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. So I've been mentioning like -- for example, like we had like some sort of -- for example, like we do\nget these like quite unfair accusations. For example, one of them was like we were underreporting injuries.\nAnd it's worth noting that OSHA completed their investigation and concluded that we have not been doing\nanything of the sort.\nLaurie Shelby\nVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)\nCorrect. Correct. The company here had a 4-month long Cal/OSHA investigation. And it basically proves\nthat we are recording properly and doing as we should be. So it's much different than what you would\nread about in the press.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectTESLA, INC. FQ3 2018 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10Yes, that is true.\nLaurie Shelby\nVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)\nYes, yes. I'm very proud of the team for that. It's a -- yes, one point I think people don't know is I've been\nhere about a year now. Time flies when you're having so much fun.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nFeels like 5 years.\nLaurie Shelby\nVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)\nI know. But when I joined, we were already really a fraction -- our injury rate was a fraction of what it had\nbeen when Toyota and GM ran the factory in the Numi days. So what we're all about is really continuing to\nmake improvements from there.\nAnd what's also important is not to have serious injuries. And that's extremely rare here at Tesla. We have\nreally strong focus on prevention and also using mitigating controls so that these types of injuries don't\noccur. I mean, most of the injuries that we have are muscular sprains and things like that.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. Essentially, it's muscle strain and getting scratched.\nLaurie Shelby\nVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)\nExactly.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nThat's the most of the injuries here.\nLaurie Shelby\nVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)\nYes, hand and finger cuts and sprains. So I kind of just want to break down a few things that my team has\nbeen working on, along with all the leaders here.\nFirst is people and engagement. So one of the first things is meeting with you, Elon. We meet with you on\na regular basis. We meet with all the production leaders. So it's full on engagement on improving safety.\nWe have built a really strong EHS team, the best and the brightest.\nWe have -- and our EHS team is actually embedded into the line on the factory because we learn the\nprocess and we learn the people. You don't know how to improve unless you're out there, on the line, on\nthe process, engaging with the associates, listening and learning from our associates. So we have really\nstrong engagement, health and safety committees. We do find it, fix it walks. Our walker -- our leaders\nare out there walking and also looking for improvements.\nAnd actually, just this quarter, we had over 15,000 improvements. I mean, that's like amazing. So very,\nvery excited about that.\nWe also look at risk reduction and -- in human performance. People are going to make mistakes, so we're\ngoing to design in so we fail safely. We have an early symptom intervention program. This is where we\nhave industrial athletes go out on the line and work with our associates before anything happens. Like if\nyou have a pain, let's work it out. Let's strengthen and really get our employees fit. So we're doing that.TESLA, INC. FQ3 2018 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11We've also just opened a new and improved health clinic. So when injuries do occur, we get the absolute\nbest care for our associates. And it's actually overseen by one of California's leading orthopedic surgeons.\nAnd we did that because most of our injuries, like we said, like 80%, 85%, are those sprains and strains.\nSo now they get that best care here on site. And we have 24/7 care. It's actually staffed by 3 full-time\ndoctors and nurses. And I'm really super happy with the care they're giving, and I think employees are as\nwell. And the third...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. We're going to expand on that. So the -- yes, Tesla's sort of health clinic both at Fremont and at Giga,\nso that we have a really immediate, first-class health care available right on the spot when people need it.\nAnd this is not just for workplace. This is for workplace and non-workplace.\nLaurie Shelby\nVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)\nI know. That's super exciting. We're leading the world.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. If you like have injury for any reason, then there's health care immediately on site.\nLaurie Shelby\nVP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)\nThat's where we plan to go, exactly. And then finally, just being proactive because that's what we're\nabout, innovation and proactive. I mean, we joined a national safety organization. We partner with many\nleading universities, including California Berkeley, Center for Occupational and Environmental Health. We\ndo presentations there. We work with the automotive industry and do benchmarking all the time. We're\nalways looking and bringing people in to look for things that we can do better and for new technology on\ninnovation and safety.\nAnd with all of that, we have made improvements in our injury rates. We are more than 10% better year-\nover-year in our lost workdays and our days away. But the most important thing is we're also getting all\nthose good engagement observations. They're moving up. So injuries down. Observations, engagements\nup. Thank you.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nRight. Thank you. Thanks, Laurie. Yes, we'll provide regular updates on workplace safety. And yes, our\ngoals is unequivocally to have the safest factories in the world where people look forward to going to work\nin the morning. So it's like -- yes, that's our goal.\nAll right? With that, we can move to questions.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nCool. Well, thank you very much.

Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWell, like for a week.\nJeffrey B. Straubel\nChief Technology Officer\nYes. Maybe for a few days. Yes, the impact was larger felt on the energy products. And that's still\nsomewhat tight. But we do -- as we pointed on previous discussions, we do have third-party supplies\nof energy cells. So that production can continue even independently of the Panasonic supply in sparks.\nSo that's been very helpful. And that is expanding in future quarters. And also the Panasonic supply is\nexpanding. The productivity of existing lines is continuing to improve with a lot of hard work from the\nengineering teams and just operational stability. And we continue to bring online new production lines. So\neven just in the last several weeks, we started out by getting another self-production line with Panasonic.\nAnd through the end of the year, there's another line coming on and then one shortly after that. So there's\na steady increase in the total supply that should keep us ahead of even Model 3 growth and also should let\nus have a larger percentage of energy supply be sourced from Giga locally.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. We are making a pretty nutty amount of the world's lithium-ion batteries. And Martin, like, I think\nwe're at 60% or something.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nYes. So at the moment, if you look at -- for example, for Q3, all electric vehicles made around the world,\ntheir total battery capacity was about 20 or 19 gigawatt hours.

So can you take us through what improved, like faster and better than you\nhad initially anticipated in the manufacturing line and where these improvements came from?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nDeepak here. And Jerome and others, please feel free to join. Our improvements on the cost side were\nin every aspect of cost. So clearly, our manufacturing labor hours improved significantly. Our overall\nmanufacturing cost dropped almost 30% sequentially, Q2 to Q3. We produced more volume. So we had\nbetter fixed cost absorption. We had far less scrap. Our yield on each of the lines across both factories\nimproved significantly. And as we look forward, we see even more opportunities.

That's great. And then on -- as a quick follow-up, you've announced over the weekend like a mid-\nrange car with smaller battery packs. And I was wondering, as you're looking at expanding, for example,\nthe Model 3, I think about it as you had 2 options. One was to go -- grow and to keep what you're seeing\nat higher-end, higher-ASP car. And the other one was to go for a lower-cost car and stick to the U.S. So\nhow did you decide the sequencing of these 2 things? Why is it lower car now and going abroad in the\nearly next year?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWell, we're trying to provide the most affordable electric car options that we can. And since we just don't\nhave the money to get to a $35,000 car right away, we thought this might be a way to offer it as an\nintermediate step. And that's really it. Yes, we expect to start producing a significant volume for Europe\nin January. And it obviously takes some time to ship. So deliveries, probably pretty significant deliveries\nin Europe, kind of in the late February, March time frame because the cars have to get all the way from\nCalifornia to a customer in Europe. And for us, cars only count as delivered if it reaches the end customer\nand all the paperwork is completed correctly. So it's the highest possible standard for considering a sale a\nsale.

So\nlong term, I'd like to say like we're not talking about like next quarter. So like what is global -- likely\nglobal demand for Model 3. It's probably in the order of -- anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million cars a year,\nlet's say, good global demand for Model 3. I think it's something like, say, the 3 Series, that's around 0.5\nmillion.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\n0.5 million.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nThe BMW 3 Series is about 0.5 million a year globally. And generally, we find that we outcompete the BMW\n3 Series quite well. So it seems like logical therefore that we will long term have a higher production --\nor higher demand, maybe somewhere between kind of the BMW 3 Series and the Volkswagen Golf, which\nis about 1 million units a year. So yes, that's why I said anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million units a year,\nlong term.\nRomit Jitendra Shah\nNomura Securities Co.

So we're aiming\nto have Model 3 production for the China market, for the Greater China market, active certainly next year.\nIt will be happening next year. But it will be done in a very capital-efficient manner, much more akin to the\nway we did General Assembly line 4 versus General Assembly line 3.

So as of today, do you have a better idea of\nwhat CapEx is required to get to that kind of level at 3 months?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nI think we're not prepared to speak to that right now, except that it will be conservatively less than the\nmoney that we spent to get to 5,000 in the first place, like quite -- I think quite dramatically less. So like\nI'd probably see a path to like 7,000 units with Model 3 with really minimal CapEx.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nVery minimal.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. Very minimal to get to 7,000 a week. And then that's really just basically solving -- improving the\nuptime of the existing lines. And we can do the 7,000 a week. Yes, so -- and then it gets a little harder\nas you start to go above 7,000. We would need to at least bring lines down in Fremont for significant\nupgrades to get to 10k. But also just not -- we're not talking about massive amount of CapEx. But\nlet's say like long term, it's -- again long term, it's -- predicting these on a quarter-by-quarter basis is\nvery difficult because when you have an exponential growth rate like we do -- I mean, if look at Tesla's\ncumulative deliveries over time, it's like the cleanest exponential curve that I've ever seen. So -- but small\nmovements in calendar time can look like a very large hit or miss one way or the other because it's such\na steep curve. That's why I'm -- it's very tricky to predict things on a quarterly basis but a lot easier if you\ngo out a year or so. Yes, I mean, it -- probably long term, it's at least sort of 7,000 to 10,000 cars from\nFremont of Model 3 and then, I don't know, 5,000 to 8,000 in the rest of world, something like that. It's\njust a guess.\nGeorge Anthony Galliers-Pratt\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities, Research Division\nOkay. And then just as a follow-up, in the letter, you do point out the size of the European market for\npremium midsized sedans is roughly twice that of the U.S. Could you also just maybe comment to what\nyour expectations are for mix in Europe?

I mean, this is like there's not -- I don't know, Martin, do you have anything\nto add?\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nYes.

You're targeting sustainable GAAP profitability and cash flow. But I'm curious\nif there's a level of GAAP profitability or GAAP operating margin or cash flow you want to hold and then\ntake the excess to fund new growth or accelerate opportunities?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nSure. I mean, maybe to -- if I characterize that question, it'll be like, are we starving new vehicle\ndevelopment in order to achieve GAAP profitably and cash flow positive? Would that be an accurate -- is\nthat essentially -- like the answer is no. So we've made significant progress on the Model Y. So in fact, I\napproved the prototype to go to production recently. So it will be 2020 before that's in volume production.\nBut we made great progress there. Also continue to make progress on the semi and the newer Tesla\nRoadster. And then actually, the product I'm personally most excited about is the Tesla pickup truck. It's\nlike -- I think that's going to reach the next level stuff there. And then I should not forget to mention the\nsolar tile roof. We'll also start going into volume production of the solar tile roof next year. That's quite\na long development cycle for -- because anything that's roof has got to last 30 years. So even if you do\naccelerate life testing as fast as possible, there's still a minimum amount of time required to do that. And\nthere's a lot of engineering that goes into how do you put on the solar tile roof with a -- and not be really\nlabor-intensive in doing so. So there's a lot of engineering not just in the tile but in the way it's done. And\nthen we've got continued improvements in Powerwall, Powerpack, other energy products. I think we've got\nthe most exciting product road map of any company by far. And I'm not even sure, like probably twice. I\ndon't even know who would have -- which company would have a better product road map or even close.\nYes. Maybe they do, but I don't know about them.\nMaynard Joseph Um\nMacquarie Research\nGreat. And when you think about Tesla having its own ride-sharing fleet or giving people the ability to loan\nout their car like an Airbnb model, I'm curious if your long-term plan is to build a platform that's going to\nenable companies to write applications to turn the car directly into an application. And then can you also\nmaybe just talk about that business model? Is that -- should we be thinking more about like a revenue-\nsharing model sort of like how Apple takes a piece of revenue generated for applications from iPhones?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nI don't know about turning the car into an application exactly. But I mean, maybe. But we're trying to\ndo things that maximizes usefulness. And so if there's a way we can think of where third parties could\ndo something, then that could make sense. But I do know for sure that Tesla will operate its own ride-\nhailing right -- its own ride-hailing service. We'll compete directly with Uber and Lyft, obviously, but then\nalso have the ability for customers to offer their car and add or subtract their car to the fleet at will. It\nwill be a company-owned fleet. And the company-owned fleet will just be where there aren't enough\ncustomer cars to be lent out. So if we find like in a particular metro, there aren't enough customers who\nare willing to add their car to the shared fleet, then that's where we'll supplement it with a Tesla-owned\nfleet. So that's why it's a sort of combination of the Uber/Lyft thing and Airbnb. And then we will charge\nsomething probably comparable to, yes, how does the App Store works, or I don't know, we charge 30%\nor something in order for somebody to add the car to the fleet. I think that's like a pretty sensible way to\ngo. Yes.",

So I've done all the analysis of all the trade-ins that we've received. And really the only\npattern that I've seen is that it's sort of all across the board, and the vast majority is non-premium\nbrands. I think that is the #1 message. It's just that more than half of the trade-ins we received were\npriced at below $35,000 when new. But other than that, there's no real pattern. I haven't noticed anything\nworth highlighting other than it's just a lot of people upgrading their cars quite dramatically.\nElon R.

I mean really, I think -- I honestly feel like the top reason to refer a friend to buy a Tesla is it's going\nto keep your friend safe.\nAdam Michael Jonas\nMorgan Stanley, Research Division\nThat's a good reason. If I can just squeeze in since I couldn't ask the first one that you could answer,\ndo you think that the third quarter is a milestone, Elon, where you think Tesla becomes sustainably self-\nfunding and perhaps not in need of outside capital?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, that is our goal. We do not intend to raise equity or debt. At least that's our intention right now. That\nmay change in the future. But the current operating plan is to pay off our debts and not to refinance them\nbut to pay them off and reduce the debt load and overall leverage of the company. So -- and actually, I\nalmost forgot one quite important thing. As -- and this is quite helpful. It's helpful to have these sort of\ncrisis situations with logistics, for example. As I dug into the inventory -- like basically finished product\ninventory from factory to the customer, I was quite surprised to see how long that took and that it was\nquite expensive in a lot of cases to get cars to customers. This was something I didn't fully appreciate\nbefore. And we really have a major initiative at Tesla to get the average time from a car exiting the factory\nto receiving the check from the customer, being in the customer's hands, we have to be clear, we can only\nget the check when we give the car to the customer. So getting the car from the factory to a customer,\nto get that to be as short as possible. In August, the average time in North America to get a car from\nthe factory to the customer was 30 days, which is embarrassingly long. By the end of the quarter, we've\nreduced it to around 20 days. And our goal in Q4 -- this is a goal, not a promise. But our goal is to get\nthe average time of a car from the factory to a customer under 10 days. This is a giant improvement in\nthe capital efficiency of the company because we're making on the order of $75 million worth of products\nper day -- of cars per day. So every day, it requires $75,000 -- $75 million worth of capital. So every 10\ndays, it's $750 million. And we -- obviously, we have a loan from the bank that we can make use of. But\nthe banks will only loan us 85% of the cost of the vehicle, which translates to about 70% of the price\nof the vehicle. So -- and then we've got this loan outstanding, which effectively increases the COGS of\nthe car. And it dilutes the company to the tune of 30% of one of the inventory -- of the finished goods\nin transit is. So this is really like tightening that and getting that below 10 days in North America and\nthen also improving dramatically the time -- the transit time to Europe and Asia. It is where like having\nlocal factories is actually very important for the capital efficiency of the overall system because I think\nover time, we want to get the time for a car going from a factory to a customer under 7 days worldwide.\nAnd then the terms that we have from our suppliers are, on average, just over 60 days. Now our parts\ninventory management, also there's a lot of room for improvement there. We think we can probably cut\nthat down to a few hundred million dollars or so, Deepak, something like that, maybe $200 million or\n$300 million of parts at the factory. So effectively, what we're going to do is reverse the working capital\nrequirement for the company quite dramatically to the point where the faster we grow, the more capital\nwe have. This is incredibly important for the capital efficiency of the company. It's night and day. Deepak,\nis there anything you'd like to...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nNo, I think you are totally -- we are reducing the raw material inventory on one hand by keeping\nproduction stable, finding efficiencies in warehouse management and supply chain and at the same time,\nreducing the time to deliver the car and convert that car into cash. And that significantly improves working\ncapital needs.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. It's really quite dramatic.

And a lot of that was driven by the actions we took in Q2 to be more efficient with our employee\nheadcount. We benefited from that in Q3. And we were really careful in terms of all of our spending. The\nother piece that helped us is a lot of our Model 3 spending on expense, sort of, R&D is reducing because\nModel 3 is going into production. So Q2 to Q3, we saw a reduction there. And it just gives you the sense\nof the leverage of -- the operating expenses can have while our revenue was growing dramatically. So our\nOpEx will increase in the future but in a far slower rate, and we will continue to be really, really careful\nabout the spending. And I think there are actually more efficiencies than we can find.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWe are going to find them, absolutely.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nRight. So we'll continue down that path.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nDefinitely.\nA.M. Sacconaghi\nSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division\nAnd then to follow up, I was just wondering if you can help us a little bit on the -- back to the gross\nmargin on Model 3 and the $35,000 car. So this quarter, I impute that Model 3 ASPs were maybe $59,000.\nAnd that might suggest that gross margins on a $35,000 Model 3 might be about 0. And Elon, I think you\nalluded to the fact that the goal is really to get positive gross margins on a $35,000 car before shipping.\nAre those all fair assessments? And I guess the question is, where is -- where would a Model 3 -- $35,000TESLA, INC.

Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. I mean, it's -- look, the problem with asking questions of that nature in detail is that it is a rapidly\nchanging situation. So like literally, if you would ask this in a month, it will be different. In another month,\nit will be different. The -- there's no question that we need to get to a point where we can sell a $35,000\ncar and where the full accountable COGS of the car is, let's say, on the order of $30,000 or slightly less\nthan $30,000. So I think we want to ideally get the COGS of the car -- of that, configuration of the car,\nunder $30,000. That would be -- that's our goal. That's what we're pushing very hard to achieve.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nExactly. And it's just a matter of time. It's -- there's a significant and material COGS reduction that comes.\nWe have the smaller battery packs with fewer amount of cells. It's not the same cells that we have in the\nexisting cars. And you can see the...\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nFewer cells but it's not the same...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nIt's the same amount of service. So same cost.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nFewer cells and then the non-cell portion of the pack is also cost reduced. With the current midrange pack,\nit still has the same -- basically about the same non-cell portion of the past cost.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nExactly. And we are seeing massive reduction in all our manufacturing cost per car, which will continue.\nAnd as volume grows, that also helps us with the fixed cost absorption. So it's the same factors that have\nhelped us so far, will continue to help us moving forward to get us there. Anything you want to add, J.B.?\nNo?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes.",

        "paragraph": "Your next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\nWanted to -- just a point of clarification. Elon, you mentioned in August the time to get the car from a\nfactory to a customer was 30 days, down to 20 at the end of the quarter. Your goal is under 10 by the end\nof 4Q. Where do we see that flow through from a COGS perspective? Is that in automotive gross margin?\nOr is that in services and other at this point?\nDeepak AhujaTESLA, INC. FQ3 2018 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 22Chief Financial Officer\nYes. It's all in automotive gross margin. All logistics costs outbound, it's all in COGS for Automotive.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nOutbound logistics. Yes, I think we'll see a reduction in inbound logistics as well as outbound logistics.\nMaybe a question is like, for the debt that is carried for that period of time, is that factored into COGS? Or\nis that not?\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nThe interest expense of the debt, that's in the interest expense line, okay. It's not in COGS.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nOkay. Yes. That's why I think for the definition of COGS, it should probably be important to include\nanything that's directly driven by volume. Essentially, that affects the marginal cost of the vehicle. So\nalthough that is not in -- officially in COGS, in my opinion, it probably should be, to take the ABL interest\nexpense and apply that effectively to the cost of the car.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd from a broader sense, you're looking at it as the cost of doing business, which can be volume.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. Just essentially, the cash flow for everybody increases quite dramatically. Dilution or leverage outside\nof the ABL line improves dramatically. And then the de facto cost of -- the effective cost of the car also\nreduces because you do not have the interest expense. If you have interest expense over 20 days versus\n10 days, this is a big difference.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes.\nJames Joseph Albertine\nConsumer Edge Research, LLC\nUnderstood. I appreciate that clarification. Sort of what I was trying to get at, you've been running in\nnegative gross margin in services and other for several quarters now. And wanted to get a sense for when\nthat could maybe trough and start to turn the corner and to generate some profit for you. I understand\nthere's a lot of building out going on for sales, service and charging infrastructure. But if you could give\nus some kind of clarification there, that would be, I think, helpful. And if you're willing maybe to provide\nan update on where you stand today in terms of battery costs. I know your goal of sort of parity with ICE\nvehicles but maybe an update, if you're willing to provide, on where you stand on that trajectory.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nI think over time, every quarter, progressively, we will see an improvement in the Service and Other\nbusiness as our revenue continues to grow and as the size of our fleet grows. It's as simple as that.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectTESLA, INC.

I would -- long term, I would expect service to be a significant revenue item and to be a positive\nmargin contributor. And it's going to be a function of our fleet size.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd age.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. And age. Essentially...\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nThere are a lot of cars under warranty now.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes. No. Exactly, under warranty. It's like there's a lot of stuff that's under warranty. But as the warranty\nexpires, so there's like non-warranty items. Then we expect service to have positive gross margin.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nYes. And that also includes our used car sales.\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nYes, good point.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nAnd our used car sales is continuing to grow, and they have a healthy margin. And so that overall business\nfor mature companies is, in some cases, more profitable than new product sales. I'm not just talking about\nOEMs, auto OEMs. And we are at the early stage of our growth here. And as our fleet size grows, there are\njust so many opportunities in that business that it's a matter of time, as I'll simply say.\nElon R.

FQ3 2018 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 24, 2018\nCopyright \u00a9 2018 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 24Elon, quick question. In terms of as the federal tax credit seems to be phased out as your sales cross\nover the threshold, what kind of an impact have you guys modeled into how much that might slow down\npotential sales?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nWe don't expect this to result in -- I mean, the sales tax -- or the tax incentive in the U.S. drops in half in\nthis quarter. But then we also start shipping to Europe and then start shipping to Asia. And we certainly do\nnot expect anything that would cause our production to drop below, let's say, a minimum of 5,000 cars a\nweek.\nPhil Lebeau\nBut in terms of in the United States, do you expect that it'll slow down demand and sales within the U.S.?\nElon R. Musk\nCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product Architect\nI think that as we're able to offer lower-cost versions of the car, that we would expect demand to sustain\nin the U.S. But I want to be clear. It's not like we're holding back this lower-cost version of the car\nintentionally. It's just like with -- it's like is there anything we can do to provide a lower-cost car now,\nand that's where we came up with the depopulated long-range pack just like basically taking -- having\na long-range pack with fewer cells. Like we really care about providing the end customer with the most\naffordable car that we can possibly produce, the best viability. And if we could do the smaller pack now,\nwe absolutely would. It's just going to take us, I don't know, at least 3 months to get the production\ngoing and you got to [ spool up ] production. And that production is going to go to -- we're going to make\nthe packs. The packs are going to go to the vehicle factory. We've got the cars that we're going to get\ndelivered to customers. So that's why customers probably see the smaller battery pack on the order of like\nMarch or something, or February maybe. It's something on that order. And one thing -- these do trigger\npoints that are worth bearing in mind. As our quarterly letter indicates, the Model 3 has the -- is the most\nefficient energy per mile electric vehicle out there. It's got the best efficiency. So we've got the best in\nterms of miles or kilometers per kilowatt hour, and we also have the lowest cost per kilowatt hour. This\nmakes it very difficult for other companies to compete with Tesla because we're the most efficient car\nand the lowest-cost batteries. So I do encourage our competitors to really make a huge investment. And\nwe've been saying that for a long time. And then they are only in this competitive disadvantage because\nthey didn't -- we try to help them as much as we could and they didn't want to take our help. So they can\nuse all our patents for free. We have -- they can use our Supercharger network if they can just have an\nadapter for our -- connector or something. We want to be as helpful as possible to the rest of the industry.\nThe fact of the matter is we made the investment in the Gigafactory and other companies didn't. And we\nput a lot of effort into having extremely efficient cars, which are having the most efficient powertrains, and\nthe other companies didn't. But I'm sure they will over time. But that's what has put us in quite a strong\ncompetitive advantage -- competitive position right now.\nMartin Viecha\nSenior Director for Investor Relations\nFantastic. I think that's all we have time for today. Sorry, go ahead.\nDeepak Ahuja\nChief Financial Officer\nI just want to add a comment in closing. And Elon started with it, and I wanted to say that from myself\npersonally here. I want to personally thank all the Tesla employees who worked incredibly hard this\nquarter and in prior quarters in each and every part of our business. Our results really are the -- are\na reflection of the execution done in the company -- done by the company and the passion that our\nemployees have to deliver such results despite all odds.
