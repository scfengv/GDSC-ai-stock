2015/5/6,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Tesla Motors FirstQuarter 2015 Financial Results Q&A Conference Call.  As a reminder, today'sconference is being recorded. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Evanson. Sir, the floor isyours.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsThank you, Huey, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's first quarter Q&A webcast. I'm joinedtoday by Elon Musk, Tesla Chairman and CEO; J.B. Straubel, our CTO; and Deepak Ahuja, Tesla's CFO.We announced our financial and operational results today in a shareholder letter that is available at thesame link as this webcast. And a replay of the webcast will be available later today at the same link.The shareholder letter includes GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, as well as reconciliations betweenthe 2. Our non-GAAP measures add back deferred revenue and related expenses for cars delivered wherecash has been or will very soon be collected. These non-GAAP results also exclude stock-based compand noncash interest expense. Revenues and costs associated with cars leased directly through Tesla aretreated the same in our GAAP and non-GAAP financial information.And during our call, we will be discussing our business outlook and making other forward-lookingstatements, which are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or resultscould differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.And now, Huey, if we could you please have the first question.","Elon Musk, Tesla Chairman and CEO; J.B.

2015/5/6,"And yes, so I'm feeling pretty goodabout things. But because that production ramp just scales exponentially, depending upon where thatexponential curve falls across a quarterly boundary, it can actually make quite significant -- make quitea significant effect on the production and deliveries in that quarter. So that's why it's like -- it's easy --it's a lot easier to predict it sort of continuous than if it's discrete with offshore [ph] quarterly cut-offs.But I really think the X is going to be -- it's really going to be a great car.

2015/5/6,"Next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.John LovalloBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionFirst question is, do you guys earn 4 or 9 ZEV credits per vehicle? And how many vehicles are participatingin your battery swap beta program?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThe amount of credits, ZEV credits, we earn depends on the size of the pack, different for what we'redoing for the 60 versus 85, and now the new ones at 70. That has been varying over time, the amount ofZEV credits we earn. So I'll need to confirm that before I give the official number here.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectThe ZEV credits thing, it's not like -- I mean, it sort of moves things by like 2%. It's like not supermaterial. So I'm not sure what the point of your question is.John LovalloBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionWell, yes, here's the point of the question is that assuming you guys sell 10,000 vehicles in ZEV states thisyear, that would mean that you would need 400 programs -- sorry, 400 vehicles involved in this batteryswap program if you assume that each of them swapped 25x each, so a minimum of 400 vehicles. So I'mcurious if there are 400 vehicles involved in the battery swap program.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, I mean, you do realize like ZEV credits don't sell for 100 cents on the dollar. They sell for like $0.50or sometimes less. And there are not always customers for the ZEV credits.John LovalloBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionYes, I'm just asking about what you guys are actually earning per vehicle. Okay, and I guess the next...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectIt's not a big deal, yes. And as more of our production goes overseas, obviously, there's no ZEV statesoverseas. And as our sales increase outside of California or Canada, those are not ZEV states. So this islike -- the ZEV stuff is like an increasingly small part of the picture over time.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWe have hundreds vehicles in the battery swap pilot program.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerIt's not like 10 or something like that. It's hundreds of vehicles.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes.

2015/5/6,"So if somebody wants to do a daily cycling basically gooff grid. It's going to be more expensive than being on grid. This doesn't mean that people won't buy itbecause there are people who want to go off grid on principle, or they just want to be independent. Andthat's what the SolarCity comment is about.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerIt might also be worth noting that SolarCity doesn't yet operate in Europe. the main target applicationfor the daily cycling battery pack was actually -- were several markets not in the continental U.S. Andparticularly, Germany and Australia are very strong markets where it does make economic sense todaybased on the feed-in tariff and the electricity rate structures in those countries. So SolarCity's comments, Ithink, need to be put in the regional context.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. SolarCity is only operating in the U.S. And the power wall, it will be available from SolarCity and fromother installers in both configurations. But if someone is doing a daily cycling application, they're doing itout of -- because they specifically want grid independence. And there's some number of people who willwant to do that, and that's good. And it's also important to appreciate like even to say the power backupsystems, so that you always have power in the event of a power outage, if -- like let's say that appealsto like 2% of households in the U.S. or 1%. Let's say 1%, that's 1 million households. Like is there oneperson in 100 care about having battery backup in the event of utility outage? Probably.

2015/5/6,"Our next question comes from Andrea James with Dougherty and Company.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionJust to build on the Tesla Energy conversation, what are your revenue and gross margin targets on thatbusiness? And how do we look at the 2015 ramp?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, I mean, the gross margin revenue obviously is going to change with time. So when it's low volumemade in Fremont, it will be relatively low margin. Once we get to Gigafactory up and running and -- highvolume and get the economies of scale working, this is just a guess right now, but I mean like maybe it'ssomewhere around 20%. It's not like -- it's like we just don't have enough information to say exactly thatwould be, but probably 20% is a reasonable guess. And then in terms of volume, I mean, we're going totry to scale it as fast as we can -- as the slowest manufacturing constraint. So I mean, it's easier to saywhat's the long term without saying like exactly which quarters it's going to be, and I don't know. But Ithink we'll see demand for stationary storage as measured in sort of megawatt hours or gigawatts hoursto be approximately double that of the car. That's our best guess for long-term demand yet.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionHow do you think about your capacity or even your cost per kilowatt hour? Because it's different than acar, right? The duty load is way different for a stationary storage application. So can you educate us a littlebit on how we look at analyzing that business and the difference between that and the energy needs ofthe car business per pack?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, there's 2 applications which are quite different. One is backup power or peaker -- sort of theequivalent -- on a utility scale of like a peaker plant, which is a high-energy application. And then there'sthe daily cycler application. There are different chemistries depending upon which one you have. So thebackup power chemistry is quite similar to the car, which is like a nickel cobalt aluminum cathode. Thedaily cycling control [ph] constituent is nickel manganese cobalt, so there's quite a lot of manganesein there. And there's just one's meant for, call it maybe 60 or 70 cycles per year. And the other one ismeant for daily cycling -- daily deep cycling, so it's 365 cycles a year.","Elon R.

2015/5/6,"The power wall is great, but it'sprobably only 10% to 20% the size of the power pack demand.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerMaybe one point on the cost structure. There's definitely a lot of commonality in the supply chain and evenin the manufacturing base on how we do the modules themselves for the Tesla Energy products, alongwith the vehicle products. So as we ramp up production on the Tesla Energy products, there definitely arebenefits to the vehicle costs of energy storage from scale and from just generally moving more materialand kilowatt hours through that whole chain. So both businesses benefit each other.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. I mean, clearly given the very high demand that we're seeing for Tesla Energy products, we'reactually trying to figure out if we can go from like our current production target of like 35 gigawatthours at cell level and 50 at the pack level in our Nevada plant to maybe 50% more than that or evenhigher because just the sheer volume of demand here is just staggering. We could easily have the entireGigafactory just do stationary storage.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionRight. So you have some capacity. I think you said maybe 15% of your capacity might be reserved forstationary storage. Maybe I've read that in an article somewhere, I'm not sure.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect15 gigawatt hours or 1/3 of the 50 gigawatts hours that's targeted at the pack level, so 15% at the 15gigawatt hours or roughly 30%.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionOkay. And you might add now maybe -- you're looking at doing another 50%, In growing the capacity50%, and you have the space, I guess there in Nevada to do that?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWe do. I don't want to make that a prediction. But that seems like the thing that we should do, so we'reinvestigating that. It seems like the logical thing to do, so we're going to probably try to do that, yes.Because we're fairly confident at this point, that the entire Gigafactory output could just do stationarystorage. It's like wow, okay, we need to make cars, too. So we should try to make the factory bigger.That's like the total logic. It's not more complicated than that.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionBut given the choice between making -- sorry, but given the choice between making a pack for a car andmaking a pack for a stationary storage application, how do you pick which one gets the priority?Elon R.","Elon R.

2015/5/6,"Next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionI guess first question is staying on the stationary storage topic. I mean, how do you view the -- youmentioned there's 2 different chemistries. How does that work with the Gigafactory? Does that require allseparate lines? Is there any more complexities or all within the same facility? And how do you view yourchemistries versus other competitive options out there? There are other people who are bullish on thingslike zinc and other more basic chemistry?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, they could still be both be built in the Gigafactory. It doesn't -- we have multiple lines operating inthe Gigafactory, so if one line is building nickel cobalt aluminum chemistry and another is building nickelmanganese cobalt, that still works just fine. A lot of the cell assembly and then the processes that happenafter that are almost identical.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I mean, they look the same at the module and pack level. You can't really tell by just looking at them.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectIt's just kind of the internal chemical constituents. I mean you can think of like the -- sort of breakdownthe problem like -- the cell is a chemical engineering problem. It's like a little can of chemicals. And thenthe module and pack problem is a mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineeringproblem. And if you have just like a small number of cells, then as an overall engineering problem, it'slike mostly about the cell. But once you get -- have a lot of cells, then it's -- then the intellectual propertychallenge, the intellectual challenge becomes more at the mechanical, electrical and software level, whichis where Tesla does quite well. That's why you don't really see -- like nobody else has like -- has a packlike ours. There -- the cells are relatively generic, but the module and pack is not.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. And we've looked at pretty much every chemistry couple that could possibly be relevant for this.We're confident what we're using is going to be the best. But if there's something better, we can alsoadjust and change over time. So there's a lot of flexibility.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I mean I'm not sure if like the exact -- the right analogy would be, but like if you had like a laptopand it's like you could say, ""Whoa, a laptop's really just like Intel CPU and some Micron DRAM chips.""

2015/5/6,"Next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionA couple questions on stationary storage first. One is it seems like utilities move quite a bit slower thanother markets. So I was wondering when you are thinking about the expectations for the trajectory ofgrowth, if you had the capacity today, how long would do you think it would take for you to get to that15 gigawatt hours? Also related to this business, it seems like you're using third parties for most of thedistribution, installation. So if you achieved maybe a 20% gross margin, can you pass along any thoughtson how we should we be thinking in terms of SG&A is allocated?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI think it's pretty early days to -- I mean, we're being super-speculative at this point. So it's...Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. Maybe one point on the distributors. We're only focusing on that approach for power wall in most case-- in most cases. So with utilities, we're building those relationships directly. That's not something thatis really effective to go through a distribution channel, and it's something we have also been doing for anumber of years. It didn't just start last Thursday. And we've built these relationships partially throughvehicle infrastructure and charging questions and back and forth, supercharging as well. So there'sactually quite a lot of trust built between Tesla and many of the utility companies, which is very helpful togrow that business faster.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionAnd just a clarification on the comment about the fact that a DC/AC inverter is already there for solar.Does the fact that it needs be bidirectional change the nature of the cost? Or not really?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerNo, not in most cases because if you have already solar, typically, the energy to charge the battery cancome from the solar panel. So I think maybe one way to think of it is, if the battery pack, the power wall,with its internal DC to DC converter, can act much like a solar panel. It can match voltage with the solarpanel array and it can feed power back into that. So the existing inverter doesn't particularly see a bigchange.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay, got it. On the auto business, do you have any preliminary expectations on the mix of the 70Dversus 85? Any thoughts on how that affects margins? And lastly, a question for Deepak.","If you had the capacity today, how long would do you think it would take for you to get to that15 gigawatt hours?

And it sort of approximated your gross margins, but this quarter, when you do the math, the impliedmargins were something like 44%, not like 29%, 30%. Is there something unusual there?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerI'll answer the second one. No, there's nothing unusual in those numbers as the overall. What you'reseeing in the supplemental information is the new cars we've delivered. What's coming through ultimatelyis the cumulative impact of all the leasing that we have done.

Anything on the mix, 70Dversus 85?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI mean, it's still pretty early to be predicting mix because you have to distinguish between what's sort ofinitial demand versus sustained demand. So I mean, it looks like there may be -- going to be comparablenumber of 70s versus 85s. But it's -- this is difficult to -- this is extrapolating on very little information.And yes, I think a key point I should make before this call ends is we're really optimizing, at this pointgoing forward, we're going to be optimizing for the operational efficiency of the company as opposed tospecific quarters. This is -- I feel like what we've done in the past, where we've really had to scramble atthe end of quarters and sometimes have not a great customer experience at the end of quarters. It's notreally the right thing for the company. And so we're going to be operating more for sort of steady-stateefficiency. And that means the quarterly fluctuations could be a little higher, but in the long term, it will bebetter. So that's an important consideration. Also sort of unlike other car companies, Tesla sales are onlyrecognized when they arrive at the end customer and we've received payment and all the regulatory docshave been processed and all that. So our sales are always kind of true -- they're always true sales. They'renot sales to the channel. Whereas the other car companies are -- they're sales to the channel.

2015/5/6,"StraubelChief Technology OfficerSome of the different revenue streams you're talking about are kind of mixed between power pack andpower wall. The BMS system lives inside the battery pack in both cases. But with the power pack, inthe more utility-sized installations, there, we often will have sort of a site master computer or mastercontroller that controls multiple power packs. And that site controller is what then interfaces to theutility or maybe a commercial customer to sort of run the scheduled charge and discharge that wouldbe appropriate for a given application. On the power wall, it's a bit of a different situation. Still, the BMSlives inside the battery pack. But in some cases, the inverter may be the system that's deciding how tomanage energy in the overall house, and that can depend on which type of inverter we're using and howthat works. And in terms of the size, we really -- for power wall again, we optimized the size around whatwas the most common photovoltaic size and also what we felt was kind of the smallest modular incrementfor backup. And it's pretty key to note here that you can install multiple power walls together. So having10 kilowatt hours doesn't mean that you can't very easily put in 20 or 30 or 40. And in many cases, Ithink people will, to have the backup kind of matching that they want to see. But we felt 10 kilowatt hourswas the lowest kind of common element. And if you go smaller than that, you start to run into worseeconomies of scale and more the system that's not related to storage.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsHuey, before we go to the next question, I just wanted to give everybody a status update.

2015/5/6,"Our next phone question will come from Brian Johnson with Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionJust really want to ask about the balance between stationary and automotive. It's not unusual for growthcompanies to change their focus as they evolve. I think at least one of the stories around PayPal, itwas going to be a cryptographic PDA-focused company, until it refocused perhaps through your help,Elon, on web-based payments. It just -- I'm hearing you talk about stationary storage as being able toramp faster perhaps, although you didn't [ph] answer this kind of maybe with a lower CapEx and OpExratio than the auto business. Yet at the same time, auto takes a lot of capital, takes a lot of OpEx. AndSergio Marchionne pointed out there's a lot of value-destroying capital spent in the legacy industry. Is itconceivable that instead of say being 70/30 auto/batteries, it could go the other way?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectIt's possible. I mean, this is -- we're, like, really super in guesswork territory here. All we know rightnow is like we have demand, like, well in excess of our production ramp. So we know like, right now, Ithink we should work on is trying to increase our production ramp, not trying to increase demand. Sothat's kind of like the only thing we know for sure right now. And then if you look really long-term what'sthe total energy -- like how many battery -- what's the total terawatt hours of installation -- of batteryinstallation that's needed to go to a fully renewable global economy taking into account transportation,current electrical needs, full electrification of transport, electrification of all heating and cooling, and thenthe current industrial uses and commercial uses of electricity like to go fully electric -- transport is abouthalf the size of everything else. That was sort of our global macro calculations. So ultimately, we thinkthings will get there, it could take a long time, but that's kind of where we think things will end up.

Or is that exclusive of that?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerWell, our projection, as Elon said, was the end of the quarter, as we ramp up production, we should befree cash flow Positive on a pure sense. But frankly, our operations should be looked at without the impactof leasing. And that's a purer measure of operations, which is a lower threshold, I get it, but that's aunique or distinct decision we've made to be in that business.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsHold on a second, Pat. Deepak, do you want to explain about the classification of cash inflows within thestatement of cash flows?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerSure. Yes, if you look at our Q1 cash flows, for example, we received $155 million from our, either thewarehouse line or banking partners related to our leasing business. But that cash flow does not show upas an offset in our cash flow from operations. It shows up in our financing activities. So our cash flow fromoperations shows up $131 million Negative. But if you offset that against the $155 million that we receivedon the leasing business, we were slightly better than breakeven purely on an operations basis.

It's just trended in the last week or 10days or so, and we were continuing to deliver cars. So that strong dollar impact does roll over sequentiallyinto Q2 for us despite the lag effect of good news from a strong dollar. And as we said in the letter, wefully expect the mix impact to be offset by cost reductions that we will achieve. So it's really related to FXthat we see the sequential drop.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. The FX was really -- that was really a tricky thing to deal with. We had a quite strong European sales.And then the FX impact was quite significant.

That's notsuper easy to make up that difference.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. And to your point, and maybe this is a broader comment to make, that as we look at our Q1 non-GAAP loss that we have of $45 million, a big chunk or most of it could be attributed to the dollar strengththat has happened over the last 6 months. As we've indicated, our Q1 top line came down by about 3percentage points. And then we had the $22 million unrealized losses, from currency. You combine those2, and there's an offset in gross margin due to lower cost of parts we buy in foreign currencies.

First, maybe you can just elaborate a little bit on the drop in the forecast from55,000 to 50,000 to 55,000. Is there some aspect of the Model X launch that isn't what you projected? Itdoesn't really sound like this is related at all to the backlog of orders from Model S.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectCorrect. I mean, we do think that it's going to be quite a challenging production ramp on the X. And ifwe are faced with a choice of -- to deliver a great -- we only want to deliver great cars. So we don't wantto drive to a number that's greater than our ability to deliver high-quality vehicles. And the nature ofthe production ramp, which is basically an exponential ramp that then becomes an S-curve, is basicallyfor every week, the longer it takes to climb up that exponential is about an 800-vehicle reduction of theX. But that's why we sort of we do want to emphasize the longer term, longer term really just meaninglike Q1 next year type of thing for long term. I think one gets a better picture of the business just sortof thinking about that. And that's where we feel really highly confident of the 1,600 to 1,800 combinedproduction of S and X, and both production and demand.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. Was there an adjustment from something like 2,000 units a week to that 1,600 to 1,800? And arewe thinking about like a 48-week production year? Or are you thinking about this in terms of the fullcalendar year?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, so that's a good question. It's like -- they are -- yes, that's average over the year. So that means likein a given week, we might go as high as 2,000 to make up for holidays, factory retooling and that kind ofthing.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. Your run rate of gross margin, obviously, it's being affected by a number of things, by launches,by mix, the deferral of Full Self-Driving revenue. Can you just talk a little bit about what are some of the issuesthere? What is the issue with Full Self-Driving?

2015/8/5,"Most of the Full Self-Driving deferral, we should be able to recover that later this year and maybea small portion going to 2016, but difficult to say at this point. And the 2 big issues that have beenaffecting us, I'd say, is the dollar, the strong dollar, and then the mix, especially as we have started tobuild 70D and the [indiscernible] Cars recently. The dollar has had huge impact. Just from Q1 to Q2, ittook 100 basis out for us roughly. So even after we consider all that and we look at 2016 to say that we'llbe at 25% and better, but the mix combined, yes, we should be there.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. And just lastly, you've had a few more weeks here since the announcement of the stationary storagebusiness. Do you have any additional thoughts on how that's expected to ramp?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. I want to back this with some degree of uncertainty because this is quite new. And again, we gotthat challenge of exponential ramp. And then depending on how you move, depending on how the baseover the next exponential ramp, the actual numbers within a given quarter could be quite different. Butthe demand has been really crazy, so it's well in excess -- I mean, if you just take the reservations thatwe made thus far, it's for well over $1 billion worth of Powerpacks and Powerwalls. And that's with nomarketing, no advertising, and no sales force to speak of really. We're not trying to sell it. It's basically apresentation and a webcast and 30 minutes of press Q&A. So there's probably room to improve. The -- sothis is -- I mean, we're really, we're basically sold out of what we could make in 2016 at this point, andassuming these orders are real, which we assume to be. So we're looking at maybe -- again, tracked thiswith a point [ph] of uncertainty, 40 million to 50 million in stationary storage in Q4, and maybe as muchas 10x that number in -- for next year. So it's 40 million to 50 million this year and 10x that next year.And I mean that growth rate is probably going to keep going at quite a level. It's probably at least a fewbillion dollars in 2017.

I was wondering regarding Model X, do we have ageneral ballpark number in terms of how many validation units we may have to produce before the robotsbecome smart enough?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI'm not sure I totally understand your question.Trip ChowdhryGlobal Equities Research, LLCLike when we had the Model S retooling, we created few a Model S validation units, I think probablyaround 40 or 50 units, which were used to train the robots.

StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, and I think as the market grows and as we go further into the future, we're going to see more andmore total energy demand coming from Powerpack. That's still our expectation.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, exactly. I mean, one thing to understand. [indiscernible] drawing this a little bit that for stationarystorage, the fundamental economics of cost are always true, meaning that there's always a costadvantage to someone -- to a systemwide implementation of stationary storage because of the high peakto trough electricity usage. So if you have buffering, which is what a stationary storage allows for, thenyou only need your power plants to operate at the average energy usage, which means that you canbasically, in principle, shut down half of the world's power plants if you have stationary storage. This isindependent of renewable energy. It does not matter whether you have solar panels or wind. This is justbeing able to shut down half of your power plants if you have buffering. Because you can then have yourpower plant output at the average of what is needed by the consumers. It seems like sometimes peoplelink this too much to renewable energy. Of course, we're huge believers in renewable energy, but thatis not the gating function of demand for stationary storage, stationary storage is really as compared toexisting power plants. And depending on the country, that may be represented at -- as a price to the userof the electricity. So for example in Germany and Australia, there is time-based cost of electricity. It'sgoing to cost more sometimes today than others. Whereas in most of the U.S., you just have a meterthat's taking over. So it doesn't differentiate between, say, day use of energy or night use of energy. Soin places where the price represents the cost, the Powerwall makes economic sense.

Andthen you're also guiding to about 1,600 to 1,800 combined volumes of production per week next year.Does that just simplistically mean that you're targeting the mix to be roughly 50-50 between X and S rightfrom the get-go in 2016?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectIt does. Although it's -- I wouldn't put too much precision on that because what we're going to try todo is to push the production slightly more in the direction of X because people have been waiting fora long time for their cars. And then in any given month, it could be 60-40 one way or the other. If youlook at worldwide demand for SUVs and sedans, it's almost dead even at 50-50. And in some regions,sedan's a favorite; some regions, SUV is a favorite. But generally it's, on a worldwide basis, 50-50. But itis difficult for us to say exactly what the S, X demand ratio will be until the car is out there and people areexperiencing it and we see what the relative order volume is.

So there's always some percentage lower than the capacity that is -- or like occasionally, youmay hit capacity, but it's hard to maintain capacity.

If youlook at worldwide demand for SUVs and sedans, it's almost dead even at 50-50. But itis difficult for us to say exactly what the S, X demand ratio will be until the car is out there and people areexperiencing it and we see what the relative order volume is. But we have so many advanced orders onthe X that that's something -- are not going to be an issue in the early days.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I'll say a few words and maybe J.B. can weigh in. I mean whenever engaging in speculativecomments like this. I think it is important just to remember they are speculative and not a predictionthat we would have, say, with very high confidence. But what we have found is -- with the Gigafactory,is that as we spent more and more time on it, we found we've been able to improve the space efficiencyof the production and the overall efficiency by more than our initial expectations. So the net result is thatwe think in the same volume, we can do potentially significantly more output. J.B., do you want to divearound that?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, I think our plans are still on track and unchanged for the first phases of production to support Model3 and to support the Tesla energy business. But the ultimate production capability of the site is whatwe believe can go much higher than we may be initially thought it could. And we do remain on track forconstruction at the site.

On the Powerpack, I want to get sort of a deeper understanding of whereyou see your competitive advantage. As I think about simplicity 4 levels of a stack in terms of the utilityPowerpack solution with the upper level being sort of the grids. Software to interface with the grid kind oftie in when it's needed, when it's not needed. Second layer is the battery management software and thenat the hardware, the inverter and other power electronics followed by the battery itself. Where do you seeyour advantage at each of those levels? How is it important to play at all of those levels? And how do youinterface with some of the existing middle people, you might call them, or consultants in the industry orother software providers who might be providing elements of the stack already?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerLook, it's a pretty detailed question. I think one of the -- maybe the high level, one of the biggest benefitsthat we offer and where we have a competitive strength is having a system that solves pretty much all ofthose problems together. I think a lot of other people aspiring to be in this market sell one piece amongthat entire stack, as you're calling it, and then you'd have to go to different companies to find the otherpieces. In Tesla, we're integrating all those pieces together for a very turnkey solution that a utility or acommercial customer can just install. I think...Elon R.

At the commercial level, that is something that Tesla is engagedin much more directly for things like demand management and those type of applications.

Or is that something they're seeking to explore through pilotsand/or their own high-intensity testing of your battery packs?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, we have a lot of data, actually. It's not -- they don't just have to take our word for it. A lot of thesetests have been running for a long time, and we can show them fairly hard cycle data and some lifetimedata. So that's been very helpful.

In the press release, you seem to address this a little bit, but there has been a lot of chatterabout cancellations for orders for the X, I mean -- and I think the press release says Signature Series. Isthat across the models? And how should we think about the different versions of the X rolling out over thenext couple of quarters?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYou want to talk to that?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, I don't think there's been anything fundamentally different. I mean, so far, on the Signature SeriesModel X, we've seen a much higher -- or a higher conversion rate than we had seen on the [indiscernible]launched S. So overall, the demand for the X, after the launch of the X, and -- has been higher. So I -- wedon't see any fundamental issues.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I mean, as we've talked about before, really, the main thing with the X is just scaling up production.We're making steady progress with each passing week. Actually, I -- 7 days a week, every day, I get anupdate on manufacturing progress and what the issues are. And we see no fundamental issues on theproduction ramp. It's just a question of how quickly we can solve each issue. And they're really downto like the little things, like the placement of the seal on the door and whether that results in the brighttrim [ph] alignment being correct. This is quite nuanced.

I know you guys aretalking about no ZEV credits in the fourth quarter as far as the sales -- or actually, at all for sales or grossprofit. But I mean, over time, I mean, is there an opportunity to maybe sell them at a much higher price ifyou -- as they become available?

Musk: The big variables are what -- technically, in which week do we -- are we able to really spool up ModelX production? And a few weeks movement, one way or the other, has quite a big impact on Model Xproduction. And then, of course, we still have to get those cars delivered. So that's what -- it's sort of logistical challenges at the end of the quarter and whenexactly does the -- and what exactly does the Model X production ramp exponential look like?

So deliveries of 17,000 to 19,000 unitsseems like not a huge contribution from Model X within this. How do you ramp up the Model S deliveriessequentially so fast?

What are you doing, I guess, better in this particularquarter?Elon R.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, I mean, the thing about a car is because there's several thousand unique components in the car,the production can only move as fast as the slowest component. So even though 99% of the Model X isready for high production, less than 1% of the parts are not, but those are what drive the rate.

I'm curiouswhat impact you see to the electric vehicle market from these revelations at VW. Could it increase thedemand for electric vehicles to your benefit? Does it maybe make nonelectric vehicles more expensiveto produce to truly comply with the emission regulations? Does that help the Model 3 be more cost-competitive? I'm just curious what impact you see overall to the industry, and then to Tesla specifically.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, I mean, the -- this has really shined a spotlight on the whole emissions testing process. And I mean,it's now obvious to consumers that gasoline and -- well, especially diesel, but also gasoline cars have real-world emissions that are substantially greater than what's experienced in the tests, when they go throughtesting. And I think that what one would naturally expect from this is that regulators will no longer turna blind eye to these things, and so the cost of producing gasoline and diesel cars that actually meet thelegal emissions requirements is going to be quite a bit higher.

Welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015Q&A Webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Tesla Chairman and CEO; J.B. Straubel, our CTO; CFO,Jason Wheeler; and Jon McNeill, President of Global Sales, Service and Delivery.Our Q4 results are announced in the update letter at the same link as this webcast. As usual, this letterincludes GAAP and non-GAAP financial information and reconciliations between the 2.During our call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These arebased on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially dueto a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent Form 10-Q filed withthe SEC.We're going to start today's call with some comments by Elon and then Jason, and then we'll go into theQ&A session. And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Elon.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectThank you. So I think the newsletter probably speaks for itself, but I'll add some commentary on some ofthe lead points.So obviously, we had a huge increase in Model S deliveries year-on-year in Q4 last year, going up 76%.We had a huge change in our core operational cash flow, which you can really see in the chart, and it'sreally quite dramatic. That's why I think it's interesting to look at in chart form. It goes from Negative tosignificantly Positive in Q4 last year. And then we made modest improvements in Model S gross margin,getting to about 25% excluding onetime items, and we feel pretty good about where we're tracking toprobably get close to 30% by the -- by about Q4 this year.And then something I'm personally quite excited about is that we expect to be Positive cash flow startingnext month and then continue on into Q2 and beyond. And that's -- there's only one caveat there that'sincluding the asset-backed line, and the asset-backed line is -- that's just funding for cars that are enroute to customers. So particularly as sales to international markets increases, there's more finishedgoods inventory on its way to customers. And so inclusive of the asset-backed line, which really I think is-- was accurately regarded as a slight decrease in the gross margin of the car by about roughly 0.1% orthereabouts.","Elon Musk, J.B.

Essentially, there's a lot of degrees of freedom that we are not exercisingthat we could, in theory, exercise.I think -- oh, and if you look at the text, it's worth noting that this is not just uniquely true in the UnitedStates. But in Switzerland, we outsold -- the Model S outsold the Mercedes S-Class, the BMW 7 Series,Porsche Panamera and the Audi 8 combined and also outsold the Mercedes E-Class. And in Germany, weoutsold the Porsche Panamera. So I think these are pretty good situations. I mean, this is even in placesthat have no incentives. Obviously, incentives are certainly helpful. They're a catalyst for sales. They're --so Tesla always appreciates the incentives, and I think they make a difference in accelerating the adventof electric vehicles. But sometimes incentives are characterized as it's sort of all about incentives or not atall about incentives. And it's really important to appreciate that incentives are an accelerant. But that's thereality of them.Jason, do you want to add anything?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure, absolutely. Thanks, Elon. First of all, I look forward to working with everybody. I'm super excited tobe here, as excited as I was on the first day I walked through the door.Just 3 quick things I want to touch on real quick. Number one, gross margin, lots of moving parts thisquarter. And let me walk you guys through it a little bit. We had over $67 million in Model X ramp-up costsand nonrecurring items in the quarter, as Elon mentioned. Correcting for these items, automotive grossmargin, excluding ZEV credits, would have been 25%.First thing, the major component here is labor and overhead and depreciation related to the Model Xlaunch. The way for you all to think about this is towards end of Q3 and into Q4, we had to bring theworkforce into the factory to build these wonderful vehicles. Also, as soon as start-up production starts,the clock starts hitting on depreciation as well. So that's what's going on there. We also had some assetimpairments, one with our old paint shop. And we've now got a state-of-the-art paint shop in place, whichis going to give us the capacity that we need all the way through Model 3...Elon R.

2016/2/10,"So this is a good story, and these are assets that we had purchased all -- go allthe way back to the NUMMI days. So we got every bit of life out of those assets as we possibly could.The other big piece here is we had an E&O write-off, excess and obsolescence. This is a result of betterproduction control and inventory management systems that we put in place. The place is moving reallyfast, and we took some time, Elon talked about this in Q2 on the earnings call during the shutdown,putting better systems in place to track this. We're moving to a place where we're tracking E&O on a real-time basis and bringing those facts to the table when we're making decisions. So we shouldn't be in thisposition again.Next thing I wanted to talk about just real quickly was cash flow. And Elon covered this, and I thinkthe chart on the face of the shareholder letter really gets there. But we were within striking distance ofPositive operating cash flows there. And when you add back the leasing proceeds that we get of $209million, it's a great step change in the right direction to getting us to net cash flow Positive.Also CapEx, we guided to $500 million last quarter on the call, and we closed out at $411 million for thequarter. That all resulted in ending cash balance being at $1.2 billion, which I think showcases our strongimprovement in cash management and discipline with the company.Finally and really quickly, talk about capital structure. We closed the warehouse line that we previouslyhad before and opened the ABL, as Elon mentioned. Think of this as a shift to lower-cost financing. We'vegot a better deal on this line. So I think it's a better way to think about that. Intended uses, one, we'llcontinue to monetize our direct leases as we did with the warehouse line. But it also creates an option forus to finance our ramp in FGI as the Model X hits full production scale.I'll just close by saying my mandate from Elon is clear: Cash is king.

So we actually started on that early and launched the campaign in the second half of 2015 to reachout to folks who had cars coming off lease. And one of the attractive things to those folks who werecoming off a lease is have a car that's equipped with Full Self-Driving.

Just given that it's 1/3 of the transaction price ofroughly your initial Model X deliveries, what are some of the efficiencies you're hoping that you can sortof draw upon maybe beyond just sort of the battery reduction -- battery cost reductions? What are youleveraging in the Model 3 from investments you've already made and sort of the knowledge you havearound sort of initial launch costs and the higher-price vehicles at this point?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I think the way to think of the cost difference is really that the Model 3, being a sedan, is about 20%lighter than -- and actually quite a bit less complex to manufacture than the Model S. The Model S wasreally the first car we ever made ourselves. So it was -- we were designing to make it work as opposedto designing it from ease of manufacturing, whereas the 3 is really designed for ease of manufacturing.And then we expect, through economies of scale and just general design improvements, to get another30% improvement. So that's where the 50% improvement comes relative to the S. So sort of 35k versus70k of 3 versus S is the way to think about the difference. And our default plan, as we've done in the past,is that the initial sales are relatively highly optioned versions of the car because, obviously, we've got topay back the investment of all the tooling and everything. So that sort of makes sense to have the higher-optioned versions first. So that's what we did with the S and obviously, again with the X. While it was sortof unfortunate that -- of the way the X pricing got reported that they reported the sort of fully optionedsignature series as though it was the base price volume number in some publications. So this was justa misunderstanding of how things work. I mean, it's -- and I think it's also normal procedures in manyother industries like for -- if Intel comes out with a new CPU or faster CPU or NVIDIA comes out with anew graphics card, the -- in the beginning, it's a lot more expensive.","The Model 3, being a sedan, is about 20%lighter than -- and actually quite a bit less complex to manufacture than the Model S.

2016/2/10,"Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman of JP Morgan.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionA question for Jason probably. Other automakers sometimes talk about what they call minimum cash,the amount of cash that they need to end the quarter with in order to fund intraquarter working capitalswings, even in the event total change in working capital during the quarter were negligible. I'm curiouswhat you think your minimum cash needs are. And is that something you can share with the investmentcommunity? And then just more broadly, what total amount of cash or gross liquidity do you prefer to runthe business with?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure. I mean we don't go over the workings of how we do those calculations internally, but $1billion is a nice comfort level. And you see we're starting to make the moves on the ABL, and it's to giveourselves more flexibility there.

And I was just wondering if you have any thoughts on whether ModelS demand would or could be affected once the Model 3 is revealed. Do you think that those vehiclesultimately go to different customers? Or is there a plan to avoid cannibalization there?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I mean, I think there's -- that they are different market segments, much as, say, the BMW 7 Seriesand 5 Series are -- and 6 are different -- they're different market segments from the 3 Series. And youshould think of the Model 3 as sort of sort of -- for really competing in kind of the BMW 3 Series or AudiA4 market, and so if you want the sort of ultimate machine, you'd really want to get the Model S. But theModel 3 will be a great car.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes.

And I know you don't do any marketing, but I'm wondering if you would ever possibly reconsiderthat. It struck me when you were saying that you aren't where you could be on the East Coast and thatmay be because people need more educating about how the car performs in the snow or whatever, do youthink there's ever a point at which you might reconsider and do some very targeted marketing in placeswhere you think you could do better?Elon R.

So I mean, if there's sortof something interesting and artistic or just like you -- it's entertaining, it's like wouldn't waste people'stime if they saw it.

So -- and just overall -- the overallvolume plan, with Tesla aiming get to the 0.5 million unit per year run rate in 2018 instead of 2020. Andthis is based off of the tremendous demand we see for the Model 3, which I think is actually a fractionof the ultimate demand when people fully understand what the car's capable of and are able to do a testdrive. So this is probably the biggest change strategically.I think also, Tesla is going to be hell-bent on becoming the best manufacturer on earth. So the -- thus far,I think we've done a good job on design and technology of our products. The Model S and X, I think, aregenerally regarded by very critical judges as technologically the most advanced cars in the world. And sothe -- I think, we've done well in that respect.The key thing we need to achieve in the future is to also be the leader in manufacturing. So we takemanufacturing very seriously at Tesla.

It's easy to get wrapped up in like a bunch of sort of short-term issues, but I think in terms of what matters in the future, I think that's the most significant thing.Overall, on the short-term stuff, our quarter-over-quarter stuff, I think, has improved quite significantly.Obviously, Model X production increased by a factor of 5 from Q4 to Q1, and we continue to make hugestrides in volume and quality of the vehicle. And I'm personally spending an enormous amount of timeon the production line. My desk is at the end of the production line.

2016/5/4,"Our first question comes from James Albertine of Stifel.James Joseph AlbertineStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research DivisionThere's no doubt you have an incredible undertaking in front of you. Can you help us understand some ofthe key obstacles and how we should consider those obstacles between now and your anticipated launchof the Model 3 in late 2017, whether it's sort of P&L adjustments that we need to make along the way? Butcan you just help us sort of choreograph how that's going to take place?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectSure. So with the Model 3, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we're really try to take a lot oflessons learned from Model X, where -- Model X, we put a lot of bells and whistles on Model X and a lotof advanced technologies that weren't necessarily for version 1 of the vehicle. With Model 3, we're beingincredibly rigorous about ensuring that we don't have anything that isn't really necessary to make a verycompelling version 1 of the car. We also have a much tighter feedback loop between design engineering,manufacturing engineering and production. And so no element of Model 3 can be approved unlessmanufacturing has said that this is easy to manufacture and that the risks associated with manufacturingit is low. There are many ways to skin a cat, and it's remarkable how you can achieve the same objectivewith a hugely varying degree of difficulty. You can sort of take the analogy and say, if you want to kill afly, you can kill a fly with a thermal nuclear weapon, with a MOAB, with a cruise missile, with a machinegun or a flyswatter. So the end result is the same, but the difficulty is considerably more significant fromone to the other, and the collateral damage is considerably more significant. So having that -- havingproduction be really fundamental to the design of the Model 3, I think, is very important. And making surewe're not adding extraneous features to the 3 that aren't necessary to achieve the production volume isalso extremely important. I'm not going to -- at the risk of this being misinterpreted, and probably therewill be some number of articles that do, I think it's worth explaining sort of how manufacturing a complexobject with several thousand unique components actually works and what dates are relevant. And it's --what -- in order to achieve volume production of a car -- a new car with several thousand unique items,you actually have to set a target date internally and with suppliers that is quite aggressive.","Elon Musk: With Model 3, we're beingincredibly rigorous about ensuring that we don't have anything that isn't really necessary to make a verycompelling version 1 of the car.

2016/5/4,"And that isa date that is taken -- that has to be taken seriously. So like, the date -- because I'm sure this will leak.It's hard to keep a secret, really. The date we are setting with suppliers to get to a volume productioncapability with the Model 3 is July 1 next year. Now will we actually be able to achieve volume productionon July 1 next year? Of course not. The reason is that even if 99% of the internally produced items andsupplier items are available on July 1, we still cannot produce the car, because you cannot produce a carthat is missing 1% of its components. Nonetheless, we need to work internally and with suppliers to takethat date seriously, and they need to see some penalties for anyone, internally or externally, who does notmeet that time frame. The -- that -- this is just -- this has to be the case because there's just no way thatyou have several thousand components, all of whom make it on a particular date. So the reality is that thevolume production will then be some number of months later as we solve the supply chain and internalproduction issues. But it is a bit of a confusing thing, and it is -- it does create some churn, becausepeople are like, ""Well, what's the real date?"" It's like you have to take the July 1 date seriously in order forsome date a few months later or some number of months later to actually be the real date. So yes, that'sactually how it has to work. So in order for us to be confident of achieving volume production of Model 3by late 2017, we actually have to set a date of mid-2017 and really hold people's feet to the fire internallyand externally to achieve an actual volume production date of late 2017. So as a rough guess, I would saywe would aim to produce 100,000 to 200,000 Model 3s in second half of next year. That's my expectationright now. Yes, so that's the thing.

I mean, we appreciate the update forthis year. Maybe the way to take the question is just kind of understand when the peak spending periodsare going to be.

So are you thinking about changing the levelof vertical integration? And how does that work into sort of the ongoing capital requirements for thisprogram?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectNo. I think we're actually going to increase the amount of vertical integration that we have.

That, I think, is a very important thing. Now once --like, if we get to a steady state and we talk to a supplier and they can do a very efficient job of makingthat part, we have no problem transitioning it from in-sourced to outsourced. I've always -- not to in-source for the sake of in-sourcing, but rather to in-source if we think that it has meaningful improvementon schedule or cost or quality. And I mean, one of the challenges we face is that for a lot of the supplychain, they are impedance matched to the timeframe for the big OEMs. And Tesla just moves a lot fasterthan the big OEMs. And so if they're impedance matched to a typical sort of 10 -- sorry, sort of -- call itlike a 6-year development cycle and we're on a 2- or 3-year development cycle, it just doesn't -- couldn'tconnect properly.

2016/5/4,"Our next question comes from Charlie Anderson with Dougherty.Charles Lowell AndersonDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionI just had 2-parter on the Model 3 reservation holders. I imagine, for many of them, this was their firstinteraction with Tesla and maybe the first time they went to a store. And I wonder, as you've looked atthat base, if there's any potential to up-sell to an S or X in the interim while they wait for their car, if youhave any programs planned to address that. And then secondarily, I was curious if you have any color onsort of the geographic split of the reservation holders.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales and ServiceYes, this is Jon. In terms of the -- your first question on their -- whether or not the reservation holders,this was their first interaction with Tesla. Just about 93% of the reservation holders, this is their firstinteraction with Tesla. So it is a super, super majority of a new client base or a customer base for Tesla,and it's exciting. It was exciting when we walked the lines. There were people waiting in line at the stores,and they were excited to become a part of the Tesla community and family. And the demographics of theowners, we're not going to say much about that, but they are a bit different, as you can imagine, than theModel S and Model X owners today. And it presents an exciting new market for Tesla as well. And it shouldbe noted that these folks are not interested just only in Tesla Motors, but also Tesla Energy, becausethe price point of a Tesla Powerwall is an accessible price point for many of these folks. And so they'reexpressing interest in both. In terms of their S and X as a bridge to Model 3, we are talking through andthinking through that, because as Elon mentioned earlier, the quickest path to receiving a Model 3 is beinga Tesla owner. We've agreed that Tesla owners are receiving priority in terms of production, and so youcan run the math I just mentioned. If 93% are new to Tesla, 7% of the reservation holders are Teslaowners. And the fastest way to get a production vehicle, even in 2017, is through Tesla ownership.

But can you talk to usabout the state production of that? Number two, on the Gigafactory and the battery size for the Model 3, Ithink everyone's abiding by 80 kilowatt-hours or 75 kilowatt-hours for the number of cars. And how do wethink about actually the Model 3 battery size and what the Gigafactory could support?

So I mean, I feel confident that we're going to hit like the 2000-vehicle-a-week target by the end ofthis quarter, of which, on the order of 40% are X. I'm just telling you, that's our internal plan and what weexpect to meet. There's no question, the X is a very difficult car to manufacture. I think it's unquestionablyactually the most difficult car to manufacture in the world. And Bob Lutz would agree with that. I thinkhe said something to the effect that he thought it wasn't manufacturable or something that. It's certainlymanufacturable, it's just a hard thing to fill [ph] for.

2016/8/3,"So Jason, over to you.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everybody for joining. I just want to make a few brief comments to add alittle bit more color to the shareholder later.We're clearly disappointed with our delivery numbers but there's some underlying stories that we feelreally good about, and I want to walk you through those. Automotive gross margin expanded this quarter.Automotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits grew from 20.1% in Q1 to 21.2% in Q2. A couple ofdifferent factors here. One was the Model S refresh. There was a modest price increase on the refresh butmore importantly, we had baked the number of cost-downs into that vehicle before the launch. And thenthe second big factor is obviously X production. We've talked a lot about how we have come through thestruggles on that and how we've managed to climb that production ramp, so that's looking great.On a go-forward basis, the way we're thinking about margins is we certainly see opportunities forcontinued cost-downs, both on the engineering front, also on the commercial front as well. We've gota supplier base that is very excited about the Model 3, and it's giving us the ability to leverage that,included for cost-downs and also continue manufacturing efficiencies. As we mentioned in the shareholderletter, labor hours per car is trending quite Positively right now and we're laser focused on continuedimprovement in that key metric.Next, talk about the cash position for a second. Here's one way to think about it. We ended up with $3.25billion on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. We started off the year, in December 31, 2015,we had $1.2 billion. We raised $1.7 billion in our secondary offering and we collected on our Model 3reservations. Therefore, we are in a very healthy position from a cash perspective.A couple of different factors here to talk about. One, we've got $678 million drawn on our asset-backedline. This is something that we've talked about in the past. That is definitely backed up by our operations.Two things there. One, approximately 5,000 cars in transit to customers at quarter end. We're financingour FGI. And we're monetizing our direct lease portfolio.Second factor on the cash position that we'd like to highlight is our continued CapEx discipline. As wetalked about in Q1, we had $217 million of CapEx in that quarter. In this quarter, $295 million of CapEx.We compare that to averaging nearly $400 million a quarter throughout 2015.","Automotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits grew from 20.1% in Q1 to 21.2% inQ2.

2016/8/3,"We're actually very pleasedwith these results and we're comfortable that we aren't doing anything to adversely impact our future. Ona go-forward basis, thinking about CapEx efficiency, you've heard Elon talk a lot about that machine thatmakes the machine. A big part of that is focusing on volumetric efficiency. In our call on Monday, I talkedabout how when we started to review a lot of the Model 3 CapEx plans across the company, there were abunch of new buildings everywhere. And the reaction to that was: wait a second, we've actually got a nicefacilities footprint already, and how can we just amplify those facilities and not have to invest further inthis area? And we're starting to see a lot of that take hold now.Second, I think we're making an attempt to crush the conventional wisdom that capacity increases onlyhappen in step-change increments and the capital that follows that in step-change increments as well. Andto put a little bit more color on that, there are many ways to optimize our current operations. The way tothink about this is we can just drive greater throughput through the same investments. So that's our cashposition.Finally, I'd just like to talk for a minute about expense management. In addition to our efforts on CapExefficiency, we're also very focused on OpEx discipline. This quarter, SG&A would have been flat quarter-over-quarter in spite of our continued expansion in service and sales, were it not for the payroll taxes wepaid on our CEO's options exercises. SG&A was up $19 million quarter-over-quarter on a non-GAAP basis.$17 million of that was the payroll expense associated with those option exercises.R&D now does continue to increase as we continue to march towards the Model 3 launch and continue toinvest in our future. This is as predicted and as we've signaled in the past.So to wrap it all up, we're very happy with the gross margin expansion in the quarter and we haveincreased our emphasis on OpEx discipline and CapEx efficiency.

2016/8/3,"Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson of Dougherty & Company.Charles Lowell AndersonDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionMy first question is around the sharing of vehicles described in the updated master plan. So if we'removing from 5% to 10% utilization of the vehicle to some larger number, I wonder what you think theramifications of that might be on the number of cars that need to be produced every year. And thenmaybe, the ramifications as it relates to the supercharger of the cars or the supercharger network, if thecars are always driving around? And then I have a follow-up.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, I think that the demand for autonomous cars will pass that way to the production capability. So Imean just want to bear in mind that the global fleets of vehicles is about 2.5 billion roughly and total newvehicle production ever year is only about 100 million.

2016/8/3,"But, Imean, I think in sort of a nutshell, the way to think about Tesla right now is that we're right around 2,000cars a week, and we try to balance the mix to be about roughly half X and S. There are some variationsdepending upon regionality. Some parts of the world prefer more SUVs; some prefer more sedans. And wedo tend to batch up our cars, so this is why occasionally you see nonsensical articles about Tesla's demandsuddenly rising in some country or suddenly falling. It's got nothing to do with that; it's just happened tobe when the ship arrived. But high-level overview is just we see demand being fairly strong at an averageof 2,000 cars a week, and we are able to maintain production at that level, notwithstanding occasionalsupplier hiccups. And then hopefully, we can grow that a little bit towards the end of the quarter and thena little more in Q4. And our aspiration, this unvarnished here [ph], this is just what we're aiming to dointernally, is to do a little better than 2,000 a week in sales and deliveries in Q4, combined S and X.

2016/8/3,"Our next question comes from John Murphy of Bank of America.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionJust the first question is as we think about the 60 kilowatt hour versions of the S and X, I'm just curiousif you could talk about the profitability of those right now versus the other models or sort of the corporateaverage as you see it.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure, so -- go ahead, Elon.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. So I was going to say, because people are optioning up the 60, it actually ends up being decent. Imean, it's not -- I mean, maybe it's sort of like 15% to 20% gross margin, whereas say, something like ifsomebody orders the performance dual motor, that might actually be more like a 30%, 35% gross margin.But there's just a small number of people that want high-performance cars and are willing to pay tripledigits or 6 more -- 6 digits, I should say, so -- but there also remains to be seen how many who orderthe 60 then choose to do the upgrade to the 75 kilowatt hour rate. So there's going to be some number,it's too early to tell, of people who buy it at 60, realize they want the extra range, and then they canjust order a kind of like an in-app purchase on the car's screen and unlock it. I suspect we'll see a prettydecent number of people do that but we don't -- it's still very early. So it's hard to say what number thatwould be. And if they do, do that, then it will push gross margins up into the 20s, like in the mid-20s orsomething.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionOkay, that's helpful. And then just, Jason, maybe just 2 quick sort of housekeeping questions. CapEx,the $2.25 billion, you're running a run rate that's less than half that for the first half of the year. Sojust curious how realistic that number is for the full year because you guys have committed to it in theshareholder letter again.

So even 2 or 3 points on gross margin sequentially,that seems below the prior guidance which you then called for 30% to exit the year on the Model S and25% on the Model X. So is it related to the updated mix view on the 60? Was there something else goingon? Or what's the source of the change?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes. No, a couple of things there. And our previous guidance had been approaching 25% on X andapproaching 30% on S. So I think we're maybe a quarter or 2 off on that, but you're pointing to theright things. One is just the mix shift that we're seeing with more Xs being produced. Those margins arehealthy and heading in the right direction, but they're obviously less than S. And now that we're halfwaythrough the year too, we've talked a lot about just the production issues we've had overall. And thosecertainly had an impact on the first half of the year and it's just difficult to make up for all of that in thenext 6 months. And then the impact, you talk about the 60s.

And I wasn't clear on -- there was an earlier question on whether the business is still tracking toaround 500 million this year. Could you just elaborate on that business line?Elon R.

It can make the quarter look low but actually, it's in vertical climb mode, sothe following quarter will look amazing.

A couple of things. First, clearly with your deliverynumbers, the California and the other CARB states are buying more Teslas. Yet last quarter, you talkedabout the value of those plummeting and we shouldn't really expect much. So kind of, obviously, you'regenerating more but a couple of questions. What's happened in the marketplace for those credits? AndI know even under GAAP, you don't list that as a balance sheet asset, but if we were to think about thequarterly generation of credits as well as the credits on your -- in effect in your car bank that could bemonetized in the future, how would we think about those?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderUnfortunately, as I said on record before, the CARB, their credit mandate is incredibly weak and needs tobe fixed. And when you have a weak mandate, obviously, the value of those credits decline conservatively.There are some quarters where we simply cannot even find a buyer for credit. And then when we can finda buyer, it's typically $0.50 on the $1 for those who have credit. So -- and then obviously, their creditonly applied to, what, roughly half of our market in the U.S., maybe slightly above half, and it doesn'tapply to Asia or Europe or Canada or Mexico or anywhere else. So it's there. It's -- I think CARB reallyshould be doing more. It's unfortunate that they're not. And then I need to sort of move right along ablog piece that's sort of going through this. But that Tesla's sometimes criticized for relying on tax creditsand that kind of thing. People really misunderstand this. What matters is what does Tesla receive relativeto its competitors, not what -- that we receive in the absolute. For our competitors, it may be worthnoting, maybe you would consider us to be a risk or something that is problematic for us. Our competitorsmonetize ZEV credits at 100 cents on the dollar. We monetize them at 50 cents on the dollar where wecould get it. That means if you have, let's say, -- I mean it depends on the scenario, but if you have, let'ssay, 3 ZEV credits for an EV that would essentially be worth $5,000 each, so that would be $15,000.

So a quarter ago, you were guiding to roughly 80,000vehicles. A year and now 3 months later, we're down at 75,000. Can you just walk us through the factorsthat are impacting that lower shipment number, or delivery number, I should say.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, I think this has really gone over the last quarter's call, is that we had problems getting to rate in thefirst half of the year, rate being an average of roughly 2,000 cars a week.

I personally probably took a year off my life or more camping out of the freakingfactories solving that along with a number of other members of the Tesla team, went through a bloodyh*** in first half of this year.

Our current plan, our current financial plan does not require any capital raisefor Model 3 at all.

2016/10/26,"And our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionJust one question about the Full Self-Driving software development. As you guys are putting the hardware andthe software and learning capabilities in the entire fleet of incremental production, you're going to havelots of -- lots and lots of very rich data that is going to be brought to you for analysis and processingand learning. And I guess, the question is when, Elon, would you say would be the earliest reasonableopportunity for you and perhaps backed by the scientific community and your own community in yourcompany to make the case, make a strong case to the regulators with the empirical data as you getand analyze it at the safety of the vehicles, even if not in a fully autonomous application but even in thesemiautonomous so that you can bring more visibility and transparency to the urgent need to address thespiraling deaths and injury on our roads?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, well, I should say we do work actually very closely on a daily basis and have for a long time withNHTSA and other regulatory agencies around the world, so really at a very detailed level. So -- but they'recertainly aware of kind of with nitty-gritty, and as I've said before, it's -- we already see a significantimprovement in safety with the semiautonomous features. And what sort of lessons we'll see outside isROE, the cases where the Full Self-Driving actually did a lot to mitigate the accident. So that the impact velocitywas -- went from being potentially fatal or severe injury to customer stepped out and walked away. Thereare many of those which provides a much more statistically significant sample set then fatalities becausefatalities are extremely rare. And you need really 1 billion miles or more to try to achieve a statisticallysignificant conclusion on fatalities. So -- but as our fleet grows, and it's growing rapidly, the number ofsemiautonomous miles grows, to the point where I think we're now trying to punch 1.5 million, almost 1.5million miles per day of Full Self-Driving in all kinds of work conditions and weather and -- throughout the world.So -- and the more time that goes by, the more miles we accumulate, the stronger the argument getsabout the confidence interval tighten, and it becomes clearer and clearer.

Obviously, you've got -- made an acquisition. You've hiredthe individual in manufacturing from last year. But really moving from the Model S and X to the Model 3ramp that you're looking for in the back half of 2017 here into 2018, how have you gone about the Model3 development differently versus the Model S and Model X that will really be able to unlock the key todriving production much higher than what your previous ramps have looked like for new products?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight, the Model 3 is designed -- is really designed for manufacturing. It's considerably a simpler carthan the S or the X. Some of these -- some modifications are obvious. For example, the Model 3 onlyhas one screen, whereas the S and X have 2 screens and 2 separate computers powering each screen.The Model 3 has 1.5 kilometers of wiring. The Model S has 3 kilometers of wiring. So we simplified thewiring system considerably. The -- a lot of the bells and whistles that are present on an S and an X are notpresent on a Model 3. So we don't have self-presenting door handles, for example, or falcon wing doors.These reduce the risk substantially in a ramp and make it just easier to scale. And so I think it's goingto be a very compelling car, but it's just -- it's a simpler design. And we also understand manufacturinga lot better than we did in the past. And we're also able to get usually the A team at the A supplier forModel 3. It's really that we're now able to get that, whereas for S and -- particularly for S and to somedegree for X -- when we trying to get suppliers for Model S, a lot of the top-tier suppliers wouldn't evenwork with us, didn't believe the car, that the -- they thought we'd go bankrupt. And the -- IHS, I thinkit's called, but they're basically a predictor for -- volume of the Model S predicted -- an official predictionof 3,000 units lifetime for the Model S. And for a lot of the big supplier, particularly the large sort ofconglomerate suppliers, they just plug that number into their predictions but they ignore what we say.And then basically, the volume is either too small to count or the car cost is enormous because these fixedcosts must be allocated over such a small volume.","The Model 3 is designed -- is really designed for manufacturing.

TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionYes, okay. And then just following up on that as I think about reduced complexity of the vehicle,understood. From an actual line speed manufacturing perspective for the Model 3, what are you doingdifferently with the manufacturing process that is going to allow you to drive that ramp in production?So think about 50,000 units, Model S, on an annual basis, it's good.

The -- there's just a lot more automation than there is for S and X. We havethe Gigafactory, of course. That's a huge asset for factory, powertrain, power electronics, chargers and afew other things. So that's a huge asset and yes -- so -- but also we focused most of Tesla engineering,including design engineering, into designing the factory. The -- I think in the future, the factory willbe a more important product than the car itself. I've said this before but we're -- our goal is to be thebest manufacturer on earth. This is a real goal. I don't know if we'll succeed, but I think we're makinggood progress in that direction.

StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, I might just add that we really learned a lot of lessons, especially from the difficult Model X ramp.That's something that's in our recent memory, and we fought through it and succeeded. But I think inthe design of the Model 3 and the system and the lines that produce it, many of those learnings havebeen incorporated from the beginning.

Now I do want to emphasize with production ramps in general that -- they call it an S curve. So therate of production is as fast as the slowest component in the vehicle. And when you have several thousandunique items, the -- it can be as fast as the least likely and worst executing part of Tesla or our suppliers,but that's just the way it goes. So it's -- you're going through a series of constraints. You try to anticipateas many as possible. There are new issues that pop up every week. And then we attack them and getthem to solve for schedule. And then another issue will pop up in the following week. So it's schedulewhack-a-mole. And if we knew what would be late now, we would obviously attack it, but some of thesethings only come to light late in the game. And when you have a global supply chain, you inherit a lot offorce majeure risk from around the world. It's just one of the things that I think we want to do is minimizeforce majeure risk. This is -- if you inherit like every force majeure risk on the earth, then of course,things are going to go wrong because earth is big.

It's very important, but yes, the -- it'salways tricky being a public company and reporting on a quarterly basis.

And how wouldyou respond in the event that regulations and standards or the potential to generate the credits were to bealtered?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSure. Well, it's only come up briefly. And my response is that I think it will be fine to get rid of incentivesand subsidies, but that should be uniformly applied to all industries. It would obviously be wrong to-- or to get rid of any sort of government intervention in sustainable energy while retaining it in fossilfuels. That -- if the principle is to get rid of government intervention, that should be uniformly applied,not unfairly applied.

It's probably why GM is able to sell the Volt at the price that they are able to doit while on paper, making a loss. It's that they -- their ZEV credits are worth only twice as much as theyare for Tesla because they get the full retail value of their credits, which is worth about $10,000 more tothem than it is to Tesla. We get basically 50 cents on the dollar when we can sell ZEV credits, which isnot always. Last quarter, we were able to sell only a tiny amount of ZEV credits because that mandate isjust already really weak.

2017/5/3,"Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionI was wondering if you could maybe give us an update qualitatively or quantitatively on how investorsshould think about battery costs. I think your last public statement was that Tesla's battery cost earlylast year was under $190 per kilowatt hour. If we look at how Powerwall 2, there's been significantimprovement in cost per kilowatt and in density. But I think if we try and do the math on Powerwall 2,we'd still come up with a number that's reasonably high. So maybe can help us -- I think in the past, Elon,you've said that you hope to get to $100 per kilowatt hour by 2020. And I recognize that's aspirational.But maybe you can help us a little bit frame how we should think about battery cost today, what kind ofimprovement you're seeing from -- or expect to see with 2170 batteries in vehicles going forward.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI mean, regarding numbers for cost [indiscernible] [ are close how competitive ] is the informationexcept that we do expect to see significant improvements year-over-year as much as improving the corechemistry of the cell, reducing essentially the cell mass that is inactive and, of course, mass economiesof scale and vertical integration at the Gigafactory. These will all take time to bear fruit, but there will besignificant time. With the Powerwall, the -- there are a bunch of other costs in the Powerwall that are morethan just the battery cost. So you've got the -- you have the cell cost, and you have -- and you get thecell into a module, you've got all the cooling systems, the control systems, the safety stuff that prevents arunaway, the enclosure, the modem to communicate to the Internet and then [indiscernible] would be thepower electronics to take the power from the cells and eventually convert that to the AC or DC power ofthe house keys. J.B., is there something you'd like to add to that?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerNo. That's a great description. It's a fully integrated product. It's a system, not just a bunch of cells. Sowhen you -- if you're maybe trying to calculate dollar per kilowatt or the cost of the Powerwall, I thinkyou'd find it's extremely competitive against other home energy storage systems.

Firstly, just to clarify, [indiscernible] weeklyinventory [indiscernible] very slightly from end of Q4 to end of Q1. And the -- and we are using someof that in different ways, and Jon can explain that further. And also to your other question on customerdeposits, what I'm seeing is that we had an artificial backlog in our customer deposits of Model Xs. And asour production of Model Xs has stabilized and as our mix of Model S has increased relative to X, we havecleared that. So it's nothing unusual from what I'm seeing there. And Jon, do you want to add on the...Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceThat's right. The increase in inventories is about split in 2. One is we increased Model X test drive vehiclesby about 1,000 over the past quarter. We had prioritized deliveries as we ramped up Model X productionand prioritized getting cars to customers first and to our store second.

2017/5/3,"This is [indiscernible] in spite of the incentives, not becauseof them. And -- but these incentives have limited lifetime and they're limited scale -- like, for example,the federal tax credit. And then the -- that caps out at the 200k. The carb credits, which the carb rules arewoefully weak. We can sell -- there are some quarters where we can't even sell carb credits. And whenwe can, it's maybe $0.50 on the dollar, or something like that. Whereas the other car companies get tofully absorb the value of the carb credit. So, for example, gives GM roughly -- I count a $7,000 to $10,000advantage over Tesla for the Chevy Volt. That's why like [indiscernible] well, GM appears to be losing$10,000 a car on the Volt. No, they're not. They're making it up in carb credits. But they get the full retailvalue of the carb credit whereas we get the wholesale value when we're lucky. But the carb credits only --are only effective at a production rate of about 20,000 to 30,000 vehicles a year. So that's why you'll see,mark my words, it's not going to be any higher than that for the Chevy Volt. That's the 25,000 -- on theorder of 25,000 units a year or 1/10th of our initial production rate for the Model 3 or 1/20th of what theModel 3 will be next year.

Those tax credits are made up -- the vast majority of it is just sales anduse tax abatement on equipment in the Gigafactory. Taxes that otherwise wouldn't been there becausethere was just a bunch of rocks there before. And you don't get a lot of taxes from rocks. So that's whyit is essentially a no-lose proposition for the state. And in order for us to actually earn $1.3 billion in taxcredits for the Gigafactory we have to generate, over the course of 20 years, about $100 billion in outputfrom the Gigafactory.

2017/8/2,"Yes, your line is open.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsAll right. Thank you. All right. We apologize, everyone. Elon, over to you.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderAll right. Thank you. My apologies. We actually tried a new audio system with a bunch of individual mics.That seems to have malfunctioned, so we went back to standard conference call object. Anyway, just wantto confirm, people can hear what I am saying. Okay, great.So first of all, let me say that Friday night was an amazing time for Tesla. It was the -- one of the mostimportant days in the history of the company. It's one we've been striving for, for 14 years. It's the carthat we've -- the Model 3 -- hanging with us [ 30 ] production Model 3s was just an incredible milestone inthe company's history. We wanted to make a great, affordable electric car, which is the fundamental thingthat is missing.We wanted to make that from day one. And if we could only have done it sooner, we would have. And I'mglad that this day has come. What we have ahead of us, of course, is an incredibly difficult productionramp. Nonetheless, I think we've got a great team. And I'm very confident that we'll be able to reach aproduction rate of 10,000 vehicles per week towards the end of next year. And we remain, we believe, ontrack to achieve a 5,000-unit week by the end of this year.So I would simply urge people to not get too caught up in what exactly falls within the exact calendarboundaries of a quarter, one quarter over the next, because when you have an exponentially growingproduction ramp, slight changes of a few weeks here or there can appear to have dramatic changes, butthat is simply because of the arbitrary nature of the -- of when a quarter ends.So -- but what people should absolutely have 0 concern about, 0, is that Tesla will achieve a 10,000-unitproduction week by the end of next year. So if you can associate where we came from, the Roadster, wewere making only 600 units a week, where the nonpowertrain portion of the car was made by Lotus. Andwe did the powertrain and the final assembly of the car, and then we went from that to 20,000 units ayear of the Model S, a far more complex car where we did the whole thing. And then we -- with Model 3,we were more vertically integrated.","Elon Musk: Friday night was an amazing time for Tesla. It was the -- one of the mostimportant days in the history of the company.

2017/8/2,"I think people should really not have any concerns that we won't reachthat outcome from a production rate.We're also very confident about costs. We feel we gained a lot of experience. We certainly aspire tolearn from mistakes of the past. And I think we largely have. Deepak will go into some of our marginexpectations there. And unlike, say for example, the Model X, where the mistake that we made, Iobviously take primary responsibility here, was having far too much advanced technology in version 1 of aproduct, it's an -- Model X is an incredible car, but it was overreaching for the first generation of a product.But in the case of the Model 3, we've strived hard to simplify and make sure that it has everything that'snecessary to be a fantastic car. If you see the reviews, the reviews are -- you really could -- one could notask for better reviews.And I'll just sort of give you one little anecdote, which was -- which I found quite surprising is that whenwe were giving test drives to -- or tests -- the journalists were doing -- were driving the car and doing testdrives. About 80% of the journalists said that they would buy the car themselves. Most of the remaining20% said probably. This is crazy. I've never seen anything like it. So this is a very good sign.It should also be noted that one of our big concerns was that Model S, particularly, and Model X demandwould suffer with the introduction of the 3. In fact, this has turned out to be the opposite situation. ModelS and X demand increased with the release of 3.Jon, would you like to just elaborate on that? There was -- we did express this as a concern, and it was abig concern, but it has turned out to be a pleasant surprise.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceYes, I think that's right. Not only, as Elon said, we expressed it as a concern. We had Positive comps bothyear-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and in orders in the second quarter. But since then, orders haveaccelerated in July as we noted in our shareholder letter. And it accelerated further since the handoverevent on Friday for the Model 3.So it kind of shows that S and X as our flagship products have a strong position in the market and strongdemand. And that's super encouraging that we've got those -- a strong product lineup with 3 cars that areproving to be very popular in their individual segments.Elon R.","We're also very confident about costs.

We really want to get -- make our cars as affordable as possible, and so that does requiresome amount of local market production, particularly for the mass market vehicles in order to make it asaccessible as possible. So we think hard about that. I think we'll have some announcements on at least afew of those locations before the end of the year. But we don't expect to spend significant money on them.Just it's identifying the location, doing the long lead-time stuff, the permits, the planning. This doesn't costa lot of money.

2017/8/2,"Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionHow do you come up with your estimate for the number of Superchargers and dealers that you need?Because you're doubling the number of the base, the number of Superchargers, according to the release.But the 3 is going to have a multiple higher in terms of demand. So I mean how do you -- yes, how doyou frame that and gauge that?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. First of all, actually I should clarify that the number of Superchargers will, in fact, triple betweennow and the end of next year. And that's -- we're confident that, that will address the Superchargingneeds of S, X and 3. So we're trying to stay ahead of it. There are occasional places where -- that aretricky to find a location, like Malibu's really difficult. A few places. But the -- we're staying ahead of that.I think it's going to be good.

So we're going tounveil the first of those relatively soon. I think we'll get a sense for just sort of how cool it can be to havea great place to -- if you've been driving for 3, 4 hours, stop, have great restrooms, great food, amenities,hang out and for half an hour and then be on your way.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionAnd if I could just follow up with a related question...Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, maybe just one other point on that and how this can scale pretty efficiently. We have Superchargersthat serve 2 major separate needs. There's long-distance route enabling between cities and then there'salso within the cities. And while there are definitely some congestion issues, which we're expanding outof very quickly in the cities, for the most part, the Superchargers that are in between cities have a lotof extra capacity. And we've put those stations in place to serve travel between the cities, but they canabsorb a lot more cars. So even if we double fleet size, it doesn't mean that we need to double the entireSupercharge network. We have to address the few urban sites that are currently in high use, but that canbe done much more efficiently with less CapEx.","The number of Superchargers will, in fact, triple betweennow and the end of next year.

And is the charge time on the 3 the same as the S?I wasn't sure with some of the release.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIt's about the same. Yes, it's comparable to the high-end S. Like your -- the recharge rate of how manymiles per hour you recharge is sort of your function of the battery pack size. So like a 100-kilowatt hourpack -- because charge rate is as a function of percentage of packs. So think of 3 and the high-end S asbeing similar in charge rates. And over time, we want to keep moving that rate up.

I had said that there were 500,000 net reservations. Well, I did alsosay that I wasn't sure because I don't follow this number and that this was just a guess. And so we didcheck for the -- to get some precision on this. To be more accurate, there are -- there have been 518,000gross reservations for 3 and then -- and we have 455,000 net reservations.

In terms of the Model 3 at the delivery event, 20 of theunits were for engineering validation and the first several thousand, it appears, are going to be going toemployees prior to going to the general public.

And I guess just related, are you still hoping tobe able to do the autonomous drive, LA to New York, by the end of this year?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, I mean I won't comment too much on like individual personnel changes. Look, Tesla's a 33,000-person company.

As a reminder, thisconference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, VP of Investor Relations,Mr. Jeff Evanson. Sir, you may begin.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsThank you, Latif, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's third quarter 2017 Q&A webcast. I'mjoined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and Jon McNeill.Our third quarter results were previously announced in the update letter we published at the same link asthis webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recentfilings with the SEC.Before we jump in to the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSo, pardon me for 1 minute. I have a bit of a cold. So let's see. Actually, we're doing this call from theGigafactory because that's where the production constraint is for Model 3, from the most important thingfor the company. And I always move my desk to wherever -- well, it's not like we have a desk, actually. Imove myself to wherever the biggest problem is in Tesla. Somewhat, I really believe that one should leadfrom the front lines, and that's why I'm here, and I'll go into some of the Gigafactory issues later in thecall, but I'd like to start off by acknowledging some, I think, pretty amazing milestones for Tesla.One thing that I thought was really profound was that we surpassed cumulative deliveries of vehicles. Wesurpassed 0.25 million cumulative deliveries since the company's inception and had record Model S and Xnet orders and deliveries last quarter. So things are really, I think, going quite well.To put that into perspective, 5 years ago, we had only delivered 2,500 cars. So our -- the Tesla fleethas grown by a factor of 100 in 5 years. I would expect, 5 years from now, to be at least an order ofmagnitude, we're beyond where we are right now and possibly even closer towards magnitude.But for the skeptics out there, I'd like to say -- ask them, which one of you predicted that Tesla would gofrom 2,500 units delivered to 250,000 units delivered now? I suspect the answer is 0, right? So consideryour assumptions for the future on whether they're valid or perhaps pessimistic.So for Model 3, we continue to make significant progress each week.","Elon Musk, J.B.

2017/11/1,"There are 4 zones to module manufacturing. So it goes through 4major production zones. The zones 3 and 4 are in good shape; zones 1 and 2 are not. Zone 2 in particular,this is -- we had a subcontractor -- a systems integration subcontractor that unfortunately really droppedthe ball, and we did not realize the degree to which the ball was dropped until quite recently, and we hadto -- this is a very complex manufacturing area. We had to rewrite all of the software from scratch andredo many of the mechanical and electrical elements of zone 2 of module production. We've managedto rewrite what was about 20 to 30 man years of software in 4 weeks, but there's still a long way togo. It's -- because the software work can be fast with the electromechanical elements that need to befabricated and installed, and that -- getting these items in place and rebuilt is, unfortunately, a lot longer,and that's -- it's probably more external constraints than software. This is what I spent many a late nighton the Gigafactory working on. J.B. has been here constantly, and we've -- we allocated many of our bestengineers to fundamentally fixing zone 2 of the module line and then most problem behind that it is zone1.On the plus side, we now have a very detailed understanding of what is necessary to fix zone 1 and zone2. We also have a new design for zone 1 and 2 that is about 3x more effective than the current design. Sowhen we put in -- and there are 3 lines of module production. Lines 1, 2 and 3 are essentially identical.Line 4, which will have the new design, will be at triple the effectiveness of -- will be as good as the other3 lines combined.

2017/11/1,"Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionGreat. Just with regard to the ramp-up of the Model 3 production, I can see what's happening with the5,000 per week target from 1Q to 4Q -- or from, now, it's 1Q versus 4Q. But I think it's less clear fromreading the letter, what's happening with the previous guidance of the 10,000 units per week at somepoint in 2018? Is that now like beyond 2018? I think, before, investors were estimating that if you couldhit it at the end of '18, you'd do over 250,000 vehicles. If you could hit it more towards the middle, you'ddo over 325,000. But what now would be a reasonable expectation based upon what you know for theModel 3s that do get built in 2018?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSo it's a bit too early to make the exact number. But I think, if you extrapolate from 5,000 units towardsthe end of Q1, we do want to hold off on giving CapEx until we are confident about cash flow on Model 3.So then that's a question of how long it takes to implement everything necessary to get to 10,000 units aweek for Model 3, which is a number we are confident can be sustained from a [ grand ] standpoint.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd we want to figure out how much we can push the 5,000 up from the existing equation.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, that is true.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd then learn from those and figure out, how do we redesign what will we do for the next step and spendmore efficiently our CapEx? So it's the right thing to do.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Yes, exactly. As I mentioned earlier, we're finding that some parts of the line, they very clearly arecapable of 6,000 or that 7,000 units a week, and maybe more than that, just by shortening path length,speeding up robots, adding some robots where there are -- where the choke points exist, simplifying someof the processes and a few minor part redesigns sum up for how much you can improve cycle time.

Usually, Tesla's been all about doing as much as quickly as possible to leadthe move to electrification, to establish a first-mover advantage, et cetera. So is the hesitancy in goingall-out growth?

2017/11/1,"Our next question comes from Brian Johnson of Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionYes, wanted to just drill down on the service revenue and expenses line. Not something we often talkabout, but a lot of the other questions have been asked. Looks like year-over-year revenues were up $180million, costs were up $247 million. Could you just talk about the drivers of that change between what'sleft of the drivetrain outsource business, the CPO business, the service loaner actual vehicles expense andthen the cost of the PP&E for the actual people and service infrastructure?Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceYes. So I think what you see there is the increase in PP&E for the service infrastructure. We wanted toget out in front of demand as we're increasing both S and X fleet size and also of Model 3. So we openeda location just about every 4 days in Q3. And to get ahead of that demand, you probably saw that weput 180 mobile vehicles on the road, and we plan to double that this quarter. And so a lot of that, whatyou see is PP&E. In terms of the drivetrain issue that you mentioned, that's mostly behind us. In fact, wesee very little of that now. The reliability for S and X continues to improve. And you asked about the CPObusiness. The CPO business, for us, last year -- or last quarter was about a $238 million revenue business.We expect that to grow to $1 billion run rate -- or $1 billion business for all of 2017. And so that businessis growing rapidly at the same time. And we're running those -- we do our own CPO refurbishment. We dothat in the same service infrastructure that we're servicing the cars. So you see a little bit of that cost intothat line as well.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. And my follow-on for Deepak, probably, is can you walk us through the depreciation when youproduce, for example, in the second quarter those 100 -- P100D cars Mr. Musk talked about going into theloaner fleet? Where do those -- how do those get depreciated while they're in the loaner fleet? And whenthey're transferred to be sold, what's the accounting on that?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes.

Yes.John Douglas FieldSenior Vice President of EngineeringIt's not the same level of constraint as the Gigafactory, but it is one of the more complex parts of theoverall assembly line. So to reach our overall production goals, that has to ramp significantly. But again,it's not at the same level of constraint as modules.

And then the 100-kilowatt hour pack, which was -- 100-kilowatt packcars was artificially priced high because we were production -- like really production-constrained on thatpack. It was never our intention to price it quite that high, so we reduced it a little bit and then addedsome content as to both. So we just sort of split it between some price reductions where we thoughtthings were a little overpriced, and then added some content just to have a clear differentiation. Weweren't quite sure what the response would be to the Model 3. So maybe we might have overcorrected alittle bit, but that's kind of where it is.Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co.

We're building complete cars andshipping them. We're shipping them across the ocean and into the largest electric vehicle market in theworld.

Before we jump to Q&A, Elon would like to have some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight, thank you. So 2017 was also a big year for Tesla. We launched the Model 3, which was our firstmass production vehicle, and it's a huge step change for Tesla. A lot of challenges but I think we madetremendous progress on that front.We also designed and installed and got into operation the world's largest battery in Australia, the largestbattery by a significant margin. And that battery is exceeding its performance targets significantly. We alsounveiled the Tesla Semi, which is a super heavy-duty truck, maximum load semi truck, and the next-genRoadster, which we believe will exceed gasoline sports cars on every dimension.And we also achieved record production and deliveries of Model S and X. And overall, I think, whilethere were challenges associated with Model 3 ramp at the -- we were in a deeper level of hell than weexpected. So a few levels deeper than we'd like to be but swiftly exiting, I think. And so it's really, Ithink, on balance, a phenomenal year. And I'd like to thank everyone at Tesla, who should be very proudof the work they've done. This is incredibly difficult. I'd like to thank everyone for their hard work andcontribution to 2017 being a really good year for Tesla.I also want to thank our suppliers, particularly those involved in Model 3, as they've shared the verticalstruggle we've had in ramping our production, and they've really burned the midnight oil, spent weekendsand taking a lot of risks and suffered alongside us in the challenges associated with the ramp.","Tesla Inc.

2018/2/7,"I'm showing we have a question from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionCongratulations on the launch yesterday. Wanted to just ask a couple of questions. One is just to get alittle bit more color from you on Model 3, what the production run rate is at the moment. Maybe if you canjust provide us with a little bit more color on where the challenges are at this point? On the last call, youtalked about, I think, 2 of the 4 zones at Gigafactory that were still kind of an issue in manual operation.Have those been resolved? And once you get to 2,500, is the ramp to 5,000 -- does that just merelyinvolve increasing line speeds?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSure. I'll try to give as much color as possible. I am reminded of -- I think it may have been Churchill'sline about sausage. If you like sausage and respect the law, you should watch neither being made. Andjust to me, that is true of a production ramp. So I wouldn't read too much into the day-to-day battles ofthis or that, but I'll give you the color, but don't like -- don't read too much into it. So yes, there are 4zones in module production. Module production is fundamentally the limiting factor on Model 3 output,which is ironic since battery modules really should be the thing we're best at. And I think in part, wewere probably a little overconfident, a little complacent in thinking about this is something we know andunderstand and put a lot of attention on other things, not -- and just got too comfortable with our abilityto do battery modules because we've been doing that since the start of the company. And of the 4 zones,2 of them, which is subcontracted to -- the production system is subcontracted to other companies, flatout, didn't work, it turns out. Like I mean, we were promised they would work, and it just didn't work. Sowe had to do what would normally be maybe an 18-month development cycle for a production system ofthat scale and complexity and tried to do that in basically 6 months, maybe a little -- 6 to 9 months.

2018/2/7,"It's an excellent design. All the otherwork that they've done has been -- has performed to spec. And we expect a single Tesla ground lineto be equivalent to 3, if not 4, of the current lines that we have and be smaller, which is, for me, kindof amazing. And then we have what we call a semiautomatic line, which is a series of small automatedstations manned by people. And they've actually been remarkably effective. It has sort of renewed myfaith in humanity that the rapid evolution of progress and the ability of people to adapt rapidly has -- isquite remarkable. Our semiautomatic -- our sort of semi-manual, semiautomatic line is exceeding all 3 ofthe automatic lines right now. So -- and that is something that we're able to scale quite rapidly. I mean,J.B., is there additional color you'd like to add on that?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerSure, that's a great summary of it. I think much has been made about the manual production of modules.That's really not very accurate. These are, as Elon said, semiauto lines where we have people theremoving materials perhaps between the machines that are actually performing the operations. But there isstill a degree of automation doing the operation.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight. It's not artisanal.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerExactly.

And when are you expecting the fullyautomated line to come on?Jeffrey B.

That -- with alleviating that constraint, that's what gets us to theroughly 2,000 to 2,500 unit per week production rate. The next constraint would be material conveyanceat our Fremont vehicle plant.

Wethink it's probably the most sophisticated in the world or at least we're not aware of one that is more so.And the software for that is quite complex.

Further, what would be your response if theregulatory bodies require that level of redundancy and that's really needed from an incremental LIDARhardware?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Well, first of all, I should say there's actually a 3-sensor systems test. There are cameras, redundantforward cameras. There are -- there's the forward radar, and there's -- there are the ultrasonics for nearfield. So a third is also -- a third set is also important for near field stuff just as it is for humans. But Ithink it's pretty obvious that the road system is geared towards passive optical. We have to solve passiveoptical image recognition extremely well in order to be able to drive in any given environment and achanging environment. We must solve passive optical image recognition. We must solve it extremelywell. At the point at which we have solved it extremely well, what is the point in having active optical,meaning LIDAR, which does not -- which cannot read signs? It's just giving you -- in my view, it is acrutch that will drive companies to a local maximum, that we'll find very difficult to get out of. If you takethe hard path of a sophisticated neural net that's capable of advanced image recognition, then I thinkyou'll achieve the goal maximum. And we combine that with increasingly sophisticated radar, and if you'regoing to pick active photon generator, doing so in 400 to 700-nanometer wavelength is pretty silly sinceyou're getting that passively. You would want your active photon generation in the radar frequencies ofapproximately around 4 millimeters because that is occlusion penetrating. And you can essentially seethrough snow or rain, dust, fog, anything. So it's just -- I find it quite puzzling that companies wouldchoose to do an active photon system in the wrong wavelength. They're going to get a whole bunch ofexpensive equipment, most of which makes the car sort of expensive, ugly and unnecessary, and I thinkthey will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage.","The road system is geared towards passive optical.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectSure. So I mean, that's -- thank you for an interesting question. The launch involve -- where things areobviously going towards is a shared electric autonomy model. So the -- in order for this to -- obviouslyfor the whole sort of system to work, you need all the pieces in place. You need to have full autonomy,full 4 or 5, whatever you want to call it, and obviously a lot of cars in the road and then build the softwareinfrastructure behind that to enable shared autonomy, so to help enable people to share their cars andbe able to offer their cars as effectively kind of a robo Lyft or robo Uber. It's sort of like a combination oflike, I guess, Uber, Lyft and Airbnb type of thing, where you can own your car and have a higher percentusage of an autonomous electric car.

2018/5/2,"MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, the hardest thing to predict about the timing is regulatory approval. The thing that's tricky withautonomous vehicles is that autonomy doesn't reduce the accident rate or fatality rate to 0 . It improvesit substantially. But the reality is that even though we think our -- when we think autonomy, even carautonomy reduces the probability of a death by 30%, which would be incredible because this is like, ifapplied broadly, there's over 1 million, I think, 1.2 million automotive deaths per year. And how manydo you read about? Basically none of them. However -- and but if it's an autonomous situation, you --it's headline news. And the media fails to mention that, actually, they shouldn't really be writing thestory. They should be writing a story about how autonomous cars are really safe, but that's not the storyif you want a click on, so they write inflammatory headlines that are fundamentally misleading to thereaders. It's really outrageous. So -- and this would be true like even if electric cars were -- I'm sorry, ifautonomous cars were 10x safer. So instead of 1 million deaths, you have 100,000 deaths, there's stillgoing to be people who will still sue and say, ""Hey, you're responsible for the death here."" And it's like,well, the 90% of people who didn't die are not suing. They're not -- they're still alive. You just don't knowit, so you -- we've got to deal with that. And then obviously regulators respond to public pressure andthe press. So if the press is hounding the regulators, and the public is laboring on misapprehension thatautonomy is less safe because of that -- of misleading press, then this is where I find the things to -- thechallenge of predicting it to be very difficult. And yes, it's really incredibly irresponsible of any journalistwith integrity to write an article that would lead people to believe that Tesla -- that autonomy is less safebecause people might actually turn it off and then die.

So I'm wondering what the philosophy is there. Is it also you're going offer that atcost and reduce that energy price? Or are you thinking of that as a revenue stream for the company?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWe haven't really talked about any of that and haven't finalized, frankly, any of that. It's -- we want tomake sure that there's a very seamless and easy system to operate trucks wherever they need to go. Andsome customers may elect to work with us on the whole system or parts of it. But I think there's a lot ofdifferent ways that, that can be solved.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. I mean, for sure, with commercial trucking like a heavy-duty Semi, economics are fundamentalto that situation. We're not making decisions based on aesthetics or consumer-related things. We're-- like we made our -- we're trying to make our Semi kind of cool and sexy just because we think thatthat's a good thing to do, not because it affects the buying decision of our customers in a meaningfulway. It doesn't really move the needle. I mean, there was like a laughable lawsuit recently from somecompany ironically called Nikola. It's like Nikola is suing Tesla. That's hilarious. Fate loves the irony. And-- but they're like suing us because of the way the trucks look, which is absurd. Nobody's buying a Semitruck because of the way it looks or because it's got like a wraparound windshield or whatever, please.So the economics are incredibly important. And so we have to make sure that the Superchargers orMegachargers, whatever you call them, or the trucks are set up in a way that you'd have very low cost ofelectricity.Jeffrey B.","Elon R. Musk: If our innovation is, let's say, twice that of anygiven competitor, then it is simply -- this is true of, generally, of companies in any industry. Whichevercompany has the highest rate of innovation, unless that company is actively killed by its competitors insome way that's nefarious or shoots itself in the foot, it will, at some point, exceed those competitors.Galileo Russell: Is it also you're going to offer that atcost and reduce that energy price?

2018/5/2,"MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, I think it's had quite a profound effect. The -- there's -- South Australia took a chance on doingthe world's biggest battery. That's worked out really well. If you read the articles, it's worked out farbeyond their expectations because the battery's able to respond at the millisecond level, far faster thanany hydrocarbon plant. And so it's value and good stabilization is much greater actually than even a gasturbine plant, which can normally respond quite fast. So it's kind of like you get in a Tesla and you can --you have that instant acceleration. Feels like you like have -- also like a mind meld with the car. It's justlike the car is you. And then that same rapid response is true of the battery pack. So the customers that --the utilities that worked with us thus far have really loved the battery pack.

And we are still building under our demand backlog and actually increasing itslightly. And we're trying to do our best to prioritize customers between residential Powerwall and utilityand commercial. I'd say our longer-term strategy is to shift a little bit of our focus and really catch up onour Powerwall demand backlog, which is quite -- it's too long right now. We know people are waiting toolong. So that's -- I think that's generally the direction we're trying to take that.

And is there a way that you can update us when you get to that 3,000 number or 4,000number per week? I mean, you -- you're active on Twitter. Can you just let us know? Because -- we'regoing to have a big vacuum here and there's a lot of news flow out there that makes volatility into thestock.

So essentially, 7,000 cars a week, plus for -- onaverage for Q3. So it's an amazing jump from only a year ago when we're producing 2,000 vehicles aweek.

2018/8/1,"It's amazing.The results you're seeing is that the Model 3 market share has surpassed all competitor premium, mid-sized sedans combined. So Model 3 market share is now a majority. July was a majority of all premiumsedans. That trend is, we think, likely to continue. So it's not -- we do not think it will stop there. I haveRobin Ren here, who's our worldwide Head of Sales, to talk about some of the interesting elements thatwe're seeing in terms of cars that people are trading in, the sales and demand trends. It's looking really,really Positive.We're also getting great feedback from Model 3 from our customers, and we're now delivering theperformance dual-motor and all-wheel drive versions. And the Model 3 reviews are outstanding, reallycouldn't ask for better reviews from some of the toughest critics in the world. And it's -- yes, and just thething that we're recognizing is that the more Model 3s we deliver to the field, it's actually causing viralgrowth of our sales. So we deliver our Model 3 to somebody, they love it, they tell all their friends, theyare actually -- really, our customers are our primary sales force. They love their car and take their friendsfor a drive, and that's the thing that fundamentally drives our sales. 5But not everyone has Model 3, obviously, so we need to get the cars out there for test drives. As it is rightnow, not even all stores in North America have Model 3 for test drives. Of course, we prioritize gettingcars to customers, but we're soon going to have Model 3s available for test drives in all stores, and boththe performance version and the rear-wheel drive version. So a lot of people who will not buy a car untilthey test drive it, just not unreasonable. Although on Sunday, when I delivered it, testing out like directdelivery, which I think is definitely the future, direct delivery from factory to customer's home or work orwherever they are. The guy here who bought it have never actually even sat in a Model 3. I'm like, wow,okay, Mr. Raul, how do you feel about the car now? You haven't even driven it. He's like, ""I love it. It'samazing."" So yes, it seems to be really well-received.Yes, so I'd approximate 7,000 cars a week.","The Model 3 market share has surpassed all competitor premium, mid-sized sedans combined.

2018/8/1,"We believe we can be sustainably profitable from Q3 onwards.We'll try to raise that rate of Model 3 production steadily in the coming quarters and try to get to the10,000 cars a week number as soon we can. What we've found, as we spent a lot of time debugginga wide range manufacturer issues, is that the potential for our existing lines to be able to produce farmore cars is much greater than expected. That by simplifying production lines, by speeding them up, by,in some cases, having things being done manually instead of automatic, and in other cases having bedone automatic instead of manual, we've been able to achieve dramatic improvements to the output ofexisting lines, which means that our CapEx growing from 5,000 cars a week to 10,000 cars a week is atiny fraction. CapEx going 5,000 to 10,000 is a tiny fraction to CapEx needing to grow from 0 to 5,000Model 3s. This is, I think, very good news for capital efficiency of the company. And [indiscernible] that'sgoing to inform future mass market vehicles that we produce.So -- and from an operating plan standpoint, from Q3 onwards, we're going to emphasize, our goal isto be profitable and cash flow Positive for every quarter going forward. Now obviously, if there's a bigrecession or there's a severe force majeure event that interrupts the supply chain, that's not alwayspossible. But we're confident that -- and provided the economy is roughly where it is today, reasonablygood and there's not a big force majeure event that we -- I feel comfortable achieving the GAAP incomePositive and cash flow Positive quarter every quarter from here on out.

2018/8/1,"We went and talked to other people like at ARM that werebuilding embedded solutions for running neural networks, and pretty much everywhere we looked, ifsomebody had a hammer, whether it was a CPU or a GPU or whatever, they were adding something toaccelerate neural networks, but nobody was doing a bottoms up design from scratch, which is what weelected to do. We had the benefit of having the insight into seeing what Tesla's neural networks looked likeback then, and having projections to what they would look like into the future and we're able to leverageall of that knowledge and are willing to totally commit to that style of computing to produce the designthat's dramatically more efficient and has dramatically more performance than what you can buy today.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, thanks. Yes, I mean, essentially, the key is to be able to run the neural net at a fundamental -- ata bare metal level so that you're -- in the circuits, especially when you're the calculations in the circuitsitself and not in some sort of emulation mode, which is how a GPU or CPU would operate. So you want todo basically a mass amount of localized matrix calculations with the memory right there. So it's a hugenumber of very simple complications with the memory needed to straight adjust those complications rightnext to the circuits that are doing the matrix calculations. And the net effect is an order of magnitudeimprovement in the frames per second. Our current hardware, which I'm a big fan of NVIDIA, they'regreat stuff, but using a GPU, primarily, it's an emulation mode. So -- and you also get choked on the bus.So the transfer between the GPU and the CPU ends up being one that constrains the system. So the neteffect is we're able to, with the Tesla computer, we've been in like semi-stealth mode basically for thelast 2 to 3 years on this, but I think it's probably time to let the cat out of the bag because that -- thecat's coming out of the bag anyway.

First, just on gross margins, it looks like S and X grossmargins were up maybe 500 basis points sequentially. And I'm wondering, maybe you can articulatewhat drove that? And then, more importantly, it looks like you're calling for Model 3 gross margins togo from about maybe 3% this quarter to 15% next quarter. That's about a $6,000 cost out per car.And I'm wondering if you can maybe help us understand what sort of the forces that drive that kind ofimprovement in a relatively short time frame?Elon R.

2018/8/1,"So as we address those slow parts andas you improve efficiency, then gap -- grow gross margin, and so the profitability of the car just improvesdramatically. That's sort of at a high level. Do you want to add to that?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerNo, you described it extremely well. So just to sort of summarize, this was a major milestone for us in Q2that the gross margin in Model 3 turned slightly Positive. And we feel really good about the path ahead.And as Elon said, it's driven predominantly by manufacturing cost efficiencies. It's the labor hours that weuse to produce each car becomes less, the initial ramp up costs that we have that are one-time as thoseinefficiencies disappear. Our fixed cost that are there, that gets leveraged to a higher volume. So all ofthat.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectActually, a thing that can also happen is that if it turns out that, say, a production part was either designedwrong or built wrong or something wrong with it, then on a kind of emergency basis, we have to go with 10low-volume tooling, which can be produced quickly. But a power producer of a low-volume tooling caneasily be 10x more than a product produced off of production tooling. And so just wanted -- you can have-- and sometimes, it's -- it gets really nutty [indiscernible]. If you got a machine and something happenedout of a block, and it's either that or make a car, but the cost of using low volume, cost of producing low-volume tooling can be really nutty.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd that journey just continues. As we stabilize and grow production from these levels, we achieve evenmore efficiencies. And Q3 also benefits with somewhat improved mix as we're going to sell more all-wheeldrive and performance cars. And in the long run, as we continue to achieve those efficiencies on cost, ourgross margins will continue to increase.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. I mean, I don't know if this trend will continue. We're trying to give you essentially all the informationthat at least we know, but we're seeing roughly half of our customers choose the dual-motor all-wheeldrive option, which is actually quite a good Positive surprise.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, it's been heartening to see that mix in terms of what customers want.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. It's -- we don't want to say this should be assumed to be a continued thing. It's just the thing we areseeing now.Robin RenCorrect. And another thing I want to point out is that we are absolutely -- since we opened theconfigurator to the general public in early July, we are seeing an increased demand coming from peoplewho do not currently hold a reservation. I think that's something that we found super exciting becausethese are the people who actually had no idea about Model 3 and they heard about Model 3 as available toorder.

And my understanding is that an important moving part here probably is -- probably the mostimportant one, is a Positive impact of the ramp of the Model 3 on your working capital. And so I did somequick math on the quarter and I see your payables increased by $430 million while your receivable didn'tmove much, which makes sense because you get paid on the spot and you pay your suppliers only on a60-day notice or more. And so if I divide that by the number of incremental cars you've been producingin the quarter, I get to about $23,000 per car. And of course, my question is whether this is a good wayto think about it, which means that going forward, when you move into Q3 and Q4, every additional car,every additional Model 3 you're going to produce, you're going to bump up payables by something in theregion of $20,000, and that's going to be the main driver getting you to breakeven and to stop burningcash.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, Deepak here.

And of course, my question is whether this is a good wayto think about it, which means that going forward, when you move into Q3 and Q4, every additional car,every additional Model 3 you're going to produce, you'regoing to bump up payables by something in theregion of $20,000, and that's going to be the main driver getting you to breakeven and to stop burningcash.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, Deepak here. I mean, there are many factors. Clearly, the working capital benefit of the differencein the payable terms versus collecting cash is one of them.

2018/8/1,"Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.Romit Jitendra ShahNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research DivisionI guess my question's for the Full Self-Driving team. We've been looking forward to this fully autonomous coast-to-coast drive. And, Elon, I think you sort of said on previous calls, if I can paraphrase, that the team'sbeen focused on developing a full self-driving suite that would work basically on all different kinds of roadconditions. And I'm just curious, what's holding back that capability today to go coast-to-coast? And arewe closer now that you've strengthened the compute technology?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, the -- we can do a coast-to-coast drive especially if we pick a specific route and then write code toreally make that route work. We could do a coast-to-coast route drive, but that would be kind of gamingthe system, and I think it's really important for the Full Self-Driving team to be focused on fundamental safety ofthe existing features. So that's -- the focus is really massively on safety of existing features. And there'sa dev -- an advanced dev role that can do things like recognize traffic lights and stop signs and makehard right turns and that kind of thing. But it's not the safety level that [makes it okay for release ]. Sobut -- yes, because it really -- you want many lines of reliability before anything that's released to endcustomers. So I don't want to take team off that until so we feel like we've really -- done everything wecan for the core functionality. And, Stuart, do you want to add to that?Stuart BowersVice President of EngineeringYes. I mean, I think, the big thing I'd say is that, Elon, to reiterate Elon's point, there's no question youcan kind of build a demo around the stuff. The challenge right now for the team is just increasing thesafety and utility of Full Self-Driving to over a quarter million cars we have today and pushing more out afterthat. So I think, when we look kind of forward to what the next probably 6 to 12 months look like, it'staking those same kind of features that we've been working on, probably deploying them in the formof active safety features.

This is Stuart Bowers. We will soon begin to roll out the team's most advanced Full Self-Drivingfeature ever, Navigate on Full Self-Driving. In our last release, we launched a new set of neural networks thatcombined together, provide a view of everything happening around the car.With Navigate on Full Self-Driving, we'll use information to understand exactly where the car is on the highwaysystem and to automatically change lanes, handle forks and take high-curvature exits to follow a navroute. Initially, it will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn signal before the car movesinto an adjacent lane. Future versions will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement if theychoose to.One area that I'm personally really excited to build on with this improvement is active safety. With theadvancement in neural networks covering 360 degrees of view around our car, we can provide a level ofconstant vigilance that humans just can't.

If I can just squeeze in since I couldn't ask the first one that you could answer,do you think that the third quarter is a milestone, Elon, where you think Tesla becomes sustainably self-funding and perhaps not in need of outside capital?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, that is our goal. We do not intend to raise equity or debt. At least that's our intention right now. Thatmay change in the future. But the current operating plan is to pay off our debts and not to refinance thembut to pay them off and reduce the debt load and overall leverage of the company. So -- and actually, Ialmost forgot one quite important thing. As -- and this is quite helpful. It's helpful to have these sort ofcrisis situations with logistics, for example. As I dug into the inventory -- like basically finished productinventory from factory to the customer, I was quite surprised to see how long that took and that it wasquite expensive in a lot of cases to get cars to customers. This was something I didn't fully appreciatebefore. And we really have a major initiative at Tesla to get the average time from a car exiting the factoryto receiving the check from the customer, being in the customer's hands, we have to be clear, we can onlyget the check when we give the car to the customer. So getting the car from the factory to a customer,to get that to be as short as possible. In August, the average time in North America to get a car fromthe factory to the customer was 30 days, which is embarrassingly long. By the end of the quarter, we'vereduced it to around 20 days. And our goal in Q4 -- this is a goal, not a promise. But our goal is to getthe average time of a car from the factory to a customer under 10 days.

Deepak, the OpEx expense management was verystrong in the quarter. I think it was down 13% sequentially, and OpEx was only up 5% year-over-yeardespite revenue growing 71%. So on that front, I mean, in hindsight, did you get too bloated and neededto get more rightsized? And looking forward, how do we think about OpEx growth versus revenue growthon kind of a more normalized basis?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. Tony, so excluding onetime items, our OpEx decreased sequentially by 5%, to just clarify that firstof all. And a lot of that was driven by the actions we took in Q2 to be more efficient with our employeeheadcount. We benefited from that in Q3. And we were really careful in terms of all of our spending. Theother piece that helped us is a lot of our Model 3 spending on expense, sort of, R&D is reducing becauseModel 3 is going into production. So Q2 to Q3, we saw a reduction there. And it just gives you the senseof the leverage of -- the operating expenses can have while our revenue was growing dramatically.

2019/1/30,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Tesla, Inc. Q4 2018 Financial Results andQ&A Webcast. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director of InvestorRelations. Mr. Viecha, you may begin.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2018 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and a number of otherexecutives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter wepublished at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectThanks, Martin. Last year was definitely the most challenging year in Tesla history, but also themost successful. Thanks to the incredible work of the Tesla team, Model 3 became the best-sellingpremium vehicle in the U.S. for 2018. And in fact, when considering battery electric vehicles, Teslaachieved an 80% market share of U.S. sales in the last year. I think this point is perhaps not wellappreciated. All other electric vehicles combined were 20% of sales in the U.S. in last year. So Ithink that's not bad.We also delivered -- also made vehicles last year as we did in all prior years combined, which is atremendous achievement by the Tesla team. The -- if you track Tesla vehicle production year-over-year, cumulative sales deliveries year-over-year, it is about the cleanest exponential I've ever seen.We've basically almost doubled our fleet every year. Every year, we make as many cars as we did inall prior years. So this is a very unusual thing to see for -- especially for a large complexmanufactured object. I think it may be the fastest that a complex manufactured object like a car hasgrown in history, or at least I'm not aware of anything that is faster. Martin, are you -- do you...?Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRI'm not sure.","Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and a number of otherexecutives will be on the call.

2019/1/30,"I think Model T was a little bit slower, but I'm not 100% sure.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect Okay. And we expect that exponential to continue. So with the deliveries this year being -- even inthe face of -- if there's a global recession -- even if there's a global recession, we're expectingdeliveries this year to be about 50% higher than last year. And this -- it could be a lot more thanthat. But even with tough economic times, to receive 50% growth is pretty nutty.Over Q4, we achieved GAAP profitability for the second quarter for the first time in the companyhistory, and we increased our cash on hand by more than $700 million, even after paying debt,ending the year with a total of $3.7 billion of cash. This means we have enough cash to settle ourconvertible bond that will mature in March.In addition, our operating margin remains strong at 5.7%. Operating margins in the fourth quarterare usually lower in the automotive industry, but this was not the case for Tesla.2019 is going to be an amazing year for Tesla. As I mentioned, we're expecting to increase sales by50%. Perhaps it could be a lot more than 50%, but I think 50% is a very reasonable number. Butthat's crazy growth for the automotive industry.I want to note that one of our major priorities this quarter is improving service operations. So really,from my standpoint, when I think about what my priorities are this quarter, it's improving service inNorth America. That's #1. And I think there are some very exciting initiatives we're going to rollout with regard to that. We're going to get cars to China and Europe and make sure that we havegood logistics for the whole delivery process, from factory gate to the customer. That's obviouslypretty far from California to get to Europe and China and then get to -- get product to ourcustomers. So we're working every aspect of that logistics chain. And I think we've -- I think it'sgoing to be good.I'd say at this point, I'm optimistic about being profitable in Q1. Not by a lot, but I'm optimisticabout being profitable in Q1 and for all quarters going forward.So let's see, we've opened 27 new store and service locations, bringing our total locationsworldwide to 378. And we increased our Mobile Service fleet to 411 vehicles.","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect Okay.

2019/1/30,"The Mobile Servicefleet is something we can scale up very rapidly, because we don't need bricks and mortar. We canget more vehicles, hire people and deploy rapidly. It also actually results in higher customersatisfaction, because we can actually send one of our service vans to your work or home and fix thecar without you having to bring it into a service center or do any paperwork or anything like that.It's really seamless, invisible, the customers love it.And we're also increasing the functionality of the Tesla App for service, so that instead of having tomake an appointment, to call and make an appointment, you can just open your Tesla App, say youwant to make a service appointment, and it lists the top 10 most frequently requested service items,and you can, with a couple of taps, you've made your service appointment. And we're going tomake it easier for the car to be picked up and dropped off as well. So if you want -- if you prefer notcoming to the service center at all, you can just request that the car be picked up and delivered.That's something that we'll be -- so that's already been rolled out and have a big improvement tocustomer satisfaction. That rolled out 2 or 3 weeks ago.But the next thing we're going to add is, if your car detects something wrong, like a flat tire or adrive unit failure, that before the car has even come to a halt, there is a tow truck and a serviceloaner on the way. So the car has already notified Tesla emergency services, and a service loaner, atow truck, are on their way before your car has even come to a stop. Now this will be immense inimproving customer happiness. Basically, it'll just call it and you'll have to tap the center screen tocancel it. So you can cancel it if you want. We just have to -- it's like automatically going to happen,you just press cancel.We're also improving product distribution. So I think we made a strategic error in the past about nothaving service parts located at our service centers. We had them in product distribution warehouses,which basically meant it was impossible to have a fast turnaround on servicing a car, because thecar would come in, then the parts will be requested, they come to the service center, this wouldbasically -- even for a very simple repair, could take days.","The Mobile Servicefleet is something we can scale up very rapidly, because we don't need bricks and mortar.

2019/1/30,"So we're going to be able to stock in allcommon parts at the service centers, so that it's possible to -- and first of all, have -- get your carserviced in 20 minutes or 15 minutes, even, if it's a simple matter. I mean, it should be like JiffyLube, like 8 minutes or whatever, not 8 minutes, that's -- it should be like lightning fast. But inorder to do that, we have to have the parts located at our service centers.Also, it's going to make sense for our service centers to do basic body work or essentially, if all youneed to do to is replace a front or rear fascia, it makes sense to just pre-stock the front and rearfascia in the common colors. So unless you have an unusual color, we can literally replace yourfascia in 15, 20 minutes, and there's none of this, like, weeks at a body shop stuff.Let's see, in terms of the new products, with Model Y , we've completed [ensuring] of and design ofModel Y , and the products are -- the tooling that's going out for production of Model Y , 3/4 of theModel Y is common with the Model 3, so it's a much lower CapEx per vehicle than Model 3. Andthe risk is also quite low. This is in contrast to Model S versus Model X, where the theory was -- Ithink Model X, we just -- it's like sort of Model X to be like sort of the Faberg???© egg of cars. It's a-- it's an incredible vehicle and probably one -- probably nothing like it will ever be made again,and maybe it shouldn't. But it is a work of art. It's a special work of art. But the commonality withthe Model S is limited. It was only about maybe 30% in common with the Model S, whereas ModelY is, I think, 76% or something like that, in common with the Model 3. And we're most likely goingto put Model Y production right next to -- in fact, as part of our main Gigafactory in Nevada. So itwill just be right there, batteries and powertrains will come out and go straight into the vehicle. Sothat also reduces our risk of execution and reduces the cost of having to transfer parts fromCalifornia to Nevada.","3/4 of the Model Y is common with the Model 3, so it's a much lower CapEx per vehicle than Model 3.

The -- as I understand it, the mid-sized SUV segment is the,worldwide, is the most popular type of vehicle. So we'll probably see a higher volume of Y than 3.And earlier this month, we started construction of Gigafactory Shanghai, and by the end of thisyear, we expect to be producing Model 3s using a complete vehicle production line. That's body,paint, final assembly, general assembly and module production. So it basically would be -- thisshould be extremely fast. I get like daily updates of progress of the Shanghai Gigafactory, and thosefactories are going to go up like lightning. So we do feel quite confident at this point, at least for thefactories that are in our control, that we can achieve volume production in Shanghai by the end ofthe year. And that should allow us to get to the 10,000 vehicles a week rate, or very close to it, bythe end of the year.And yes, I think that's it.","The demand for Model Y will be maybe 50% higherthan Model 3, could be even double.

2019/1/30,"Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay, great. So we're going to take the first questions from our retail investors who have beensubmitting their questions on say.com. So the question that has been submitted has been aboutservice, which I think you already spoke at length about. So let's go to the second question.The second question would be, how are you feeling about demand right now across the productline? Is 500,000 to 700,000 units at $42,000 ASP still a realistic annual target for Model 3, evenconsidering Model Y and its impact on demand? And do you continue to see S and X demand of100,000 annually?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI mean, my best guess, this is just a guess, my best guess for demand of Model 3 worldwide issomething -- in a strong economy, is something on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year.That's my best guess for demand of Model 3 in a strong economy. If the economy goes into arecession, then I think that could be something on the -- 40% less. But I think even in a recession,worldwide demand is still something in the order of 500,000 for Model 3. For S and X, we dideliminate the 75 kilowatt hour version of S and X and to provide more differentiation relative to 3and then Y that's coming out. I think we could see a slight decline in total vehicles, but I think thenet cash flow from S and X is likely to be very similar. So probably no major change in net cashflow for S and X.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The next question from Alex is, can you please share an update on full self-driving and TeslaNetwork development? When will customers start to see full self driving features? What's the bestcase time line for Tesla Network to go live?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectSure. We -- we already have full self-driving capability on highway. So from highway on-ramp tohighway exit, including passing cars and going from one highway interchange to another, full selfdriving capability is there. In a few weeks, we'll be pushing an update that will allow the option ofremoving stalk confirm in markets where regulators approve it, which we believe that will be thecase in the U.S., for example.","The second question would be, how are you feeling about demand right now across the productline?

2019/1/30,"So maybe we'll take the last question from retail investors, which was, where will Tesla Semiand Model Y be produced? Can you share a time line on expected production ramp of theseproducts?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI was mentioning earlier, the Model Y , we think, most likely will be produced at Gigafactory, butthat's -- unless we encounter some obstacle -- that's the default plan that we're proceeding towards.And it's fast, lower risk and relatively low CapEx. In terms of the -- I mean, probably there's likeinitial production of Model Y , very low volume, early next year. But then it always takes time toramp up any production system, and it's difficult to predict the shape of that S-curve. So we feelconfident in saying there will be production volume of Model Y by the end of next year. But inbetween beginning of next year with low volume, it always starts with very low, and then it growsexponentially, from beginning of last year to end of next year, it's difficult to predict that ramp.

2019/1/30,"Our first question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.Ryan J. Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research AnalystI see in the letter the amount that you have spent on land for Gigafactory Shanghai in theclassification operating cash flows. Is there any guidance you can provide us in terms of how tothink about CapEx for this facility going forward? And can you discuss the source of funds for theproject? I think you've spoken in the past about the potential to raise debt locally in China. Is thatstill your thinking? And what kind of terms might you be able to raise that capital?Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOYes, Deepak here. You're right. The purchase of the land is a 50-year lease with the government ofChina. So it's not CapEx, but it's operating lease that shows up as cash flow from operations.However, the CapEx that we will invest is our equipment, and we fully own it. So that will show upas capital expenditures. The plan, as we have indicated in the letter, is still to get funding for amajority of debt capital spending from local China banks. And we expect pretty attractive ratesbased on the dialogue we've had. And there's a lot of interest. And we hope to finalize that and thenshare the details at that point.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, I mean, as a ballpark figure, probably it's something about -- something in the order of $0.5billion in CapEx to get to the 3,000 vehicle rate in Shanghai, ballpark figure. And as Deepak wassaying, we've been offered very competitive debt financing in China, really extremely compellinginterest rates, so we do not expect that to be a capital drain on the company.Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOYes, these are the biggest banks in the world, and for them, $500 million is not a large amount ofmoney in the scheme of things.","Elon R.

Is this nice to have? Is it really about EVs and renewableenergy? Or is the autonomy kind of one of the foundational parts of the story longer term?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectTo find out the goodness of Tesla, so like sort of the why of Tesla, the relevance, what's the point ofTesla, comes down to 2 things: acceleration of sustainable energy and autonomy. The accelerationof sustainable energy is absolutely fundamental because this is the next potential risk for humanity.So obviously, that is, by far and away, the most important thing. But also, very important isautonomy. This has the potential to save millions of lives, tens of millions of serious highwayinjuries and give people their time back so that they don't have to drive, they can -- if you're on theroad, you can spend time doing things that you enjoy instead of being in terrible traffic.

And just to clarify, when you're sort of talking about the outlook for 2019, the numberof deliveries up 50% and then the margin target for Model 3 to get to 25%, does that assume thatyou're introducing a lower range, the short-range Model 3 at some point during the year?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectWell, we call it the standard range, but it's maybe short by Tesla's standards, but it's long range byother manufacturers' standards.

Is that correct?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystOkay.

I think you just mentionedin the previous question 350,000 to 500,000, if I understood well. So what is sort of like what drivesthe cautious outlook that's in your letter?

Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectThanks, Martin. On Monday, we hosted our first-ever Autonomy Investor Day, showcasing our newin-house designed full self-driving computer and our AI-based software trained by more than400,000 Tesla vehicles. All Tesla cars being built today have all the hardware necessary for fullself-driving, and over the year updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailingnetwork fleet and generate income which, as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago, we think issomewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 a year, in some cases, perhaps more. We're the onlycompany in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chipfor full self-driving. We're in a position unlike anyone else in the industry. And in 2020, we expectto have 1 million robotaxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.

2019/4/24,"Last quarter,we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North Americaexperienced last year as well as a massive increase in delivery volume to China.As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have because we booked vehicles and consumersbought them, but this rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resultedin over half of our global deliveries occurring in the final 10 days of Q1.This was the most difficult logistics problem I've ever seen, and I've seen some tough ones. So I'llsay it again, equipment fleet delivered the half of all vehicles produced -- delivered all half -- alldeliveries occurred literally in the final 10 days of Q1. As a result, a large number of vehicles -- the vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2 which, of course, Q1net income to be Negatively impacted. As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customersspecifically in time. In response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehiclebooked throughout the quarter. This will make the -- this will put much less strain on Tesla, resultsin a much better delivery experience for customers and have a very Positive effect on our workingcapital in the middle of the quarter.In Q1, Model 3 was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner-up byalmost 60%. It's worth to dwell on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared topredictions that were made several years ago. There were literally, to the best of my knowledge, 0predictions that this would happen, if you go back just even 5 or 6 years ago, that an electric carwould be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe, over time, we'll be the best-selling premium car throughout the world.And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever. Andthat'd be something similar in Switzerland as well. So these were really incredible achievements bythe Tesla team.Since the introduction of Standard Range and Standard Range Plus, nearly 70% of trade-ins fromModel 3 have actually been nonpremium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car thanthey have ever paid for a car.","Last quarter,we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North Americaexperienced last year.

2019/4/24,"They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because theywant the Model 3 more than they ever wanted a vehicle, they're willing to pay more to get a Model3.And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model 3 has just begun, and this segment is vastlylarger internationally than it is in the U.S. We're continuing to make significant improvements to ourvehicle lineup, including updating the Model S and X production line to accommodate the nextgeneration of powertrains. So we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with thesignificantly more balanced powertrains for the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to thesuspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension system and to enable chargingat 200 kilowatts, which is -- and there are a number of other small changes. If anyone is thinkingabout upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it. And we also introduced the loyaltyprogram where if somebody has -- is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance Model Sor X, they get the Ludicrous upgrade for free. So this is -- yes, as a thank you and an appreciation toexisting Tesla customers.So they have a longer range. The Model S now has a range of 370 miles. This is actually EPA rangeof 370 miles, and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop all the way fromSan Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds. And they said they could have even gonefaster. And there weren't any headwind as well. So this is pretty remarkable that an electric carcould go nonstop between the 2 biggest cities in California. I mean, I remember back when I wasdriving gasoline cars, I always had to stop at a gas station. This is literally better than a gasoline carwith the rare exception. And there's also an increase in power. It accelerates faster. Just better, betterin every way. And we're able to this without increasing the size of the battery pack, which is atestament to the powertrain team for it to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain bysuch a significant margin.So with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continuedexpansion of Model 3 globally, we expect our order rate to increase significantly throughout theyear and commensurate with our production levels.","The Model S now has a range of 370 miles, and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop all the way fromSan Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds.

And no question in my mind that Tesla hasthe most exciting product road map of any consumer product company in the world.And finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for theircontinued support.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, Elon. And I think Zach -- Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, thank you, Martin, and thanks, Elon, as well. Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, thiswas one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in the history of the company. And itwas ambitious even by Tesla's own standard. The global expansion of Model 3 was a huge themewithin the quarter. We launched the Standard Range lineup for Model 3, product retooling forModel S and Model X, which Elon just talked about with the range enhancements and suspensionupgrades, and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and worked to do thecorresponding impact that had on our order mix in deliverable cars. So there's 2 key themes that I'dlike to discuss briefly, and then we'll open it up to Q&A, around cash and profitability for thequarter.First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. Thiswas a $1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to 2factors. The first is that we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1. Note for those of youlooking to the cash flow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows.The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact ofexpanding Model 3 operations overseas. And the 2 components to this which we have discussed, isthat an international operation naturally commands additional working capital because of transittimes, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not all of our cars will bedelivered. Both of these factors which occurred in Q1 we do not expect to repeat in Q2.","Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, Elon.

2019/4/24,"And weexpect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going forward. I'll also note thatwe're tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries for a month 1 in the history of thecompany.On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10days of the quarter. This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarterand then U.S. local builds in the second half. This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEAand China and significantly stressed the delivery operations. Note, we also faced import issues inShanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries towards the finalcouple of days and weeks in the quarter. So we're addressing this by regionally on balance -- bybuilding regionally balanced, and we've already executed on this for Model 3, and S and X will beimplemented in the next week or 2.The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter. Sowe don't have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the peak. We expectsignificant cost savings to come from this.On the P&L side, we incurred $188 million of one-time adjustments that flowed through to netincome. $120 million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced onFebruary 28. This included a reserve for a potential increased return rate for our Residual ValueGuarantee and Buyback Guarantee of vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of ourused Tesla inventory and service deliveries. There's an additional $67 million related to Q1restructuring and other charges that flowed through.Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue wasNegatively impacted by $501 million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline indeliveries.Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately 28 -- to20%. This is due to 2 factors. One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February 28 as wellas a mix shift towards the Standard Range lineup which we launched. We also successfullyexecuted on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact.","50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter.

2019/4/24,"Labor content, warehousing andscrap, as examples, all had double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1.In spite of launching the Standard Range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs areclose to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being for long-range variants of Model 3.In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant. Two major pieces here: the volumereduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our margin as well as thepricing actions that we took on February 28. Even though S and X had been in production for awhile, we still continue to make operational improvements there, the labor content as an example,which improved quarter-over-quarter.As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon's sentiments about the excitement of our productlineup. But from a financial standpoint, what we've effectively done here is build an incredible baseof knowledge and assets that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around theworld.So Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this. As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing upcapacity 50% for Giga Shanghai as compared to the Model 3 in the U.S., and that 50%, our internalforecast that we're executing against, is actually better than that.And Model Y , as we've noted, is built on the Model 3 platform, so we're able to leverage theknowledge there for capital-efficient expansion.In energy as well, as we've noted previously, 2019 is a big year for storage, so a lot of excitingimprovements coming there. And the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilizesome of the assets that we've made investments in that.So just to conclude the opening remarks here, I've personally never felt more excited about thefuture of the company, and I'm looking forward to the discussion.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, Zachary.

Can you speak to the energy side of the company, specifically theroad map for when you see the energy side of things really taking off and generating major revenuefor the company?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectSure. The challenge really is battery cell scarcity. As far as the stationary storage is concerned, webasically need an upsell to support the vehicle production as well as to both Powerwall andPowerpack. Last year, in order to have enough cells for Model 3, we actually had to convert all ofthe lines of the Gigafactory to produce cells just for the Model 3 as opposed to Powerwall,Powerpack. And so we're essentially scrounging cells from all around the world to, at least,continue some level of production on the Powerwall and Powerpack. This year, we think that we'llbe able to allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of cell outputs. [I incur] J.B., like what do you guysthink?Jeffrey B. Straubel - Tesla, Inc. - CTOYes.Elon R.

2019/4/24,"So there are far fewer cells in a Powerwall than in a car, so that translates to quite a decentnumber of Powerwalls. And then we will continue to use cells from various suppliers around theworld. The Powerwall and Powerpack, because they don't have to go through vehicle homologation,are much more adaptable to using a variety of cells from other cell providers. So are we expectingthat Powerwall and Powerpack to see a very significant percentage growth this year, maybe on theorder of 300% or some quite high number. Sorry? Sorry? Yes, 300%. I guess he was just confirmingit, 300%. So this is a very big percentage growth rate. It's much faster than an automotive. So overtime, we would expect that to -- that sort of growth rate we hope will be able to continue and thenbattery storage will become a bigger and bigger percentage of Tesla's business over time. We alsohave -- we're also planning a significant increase in retrofit solar this year because we've finallyrefined the product offering to be something that's extremely compelling and much more costefficient to deliver and install. So a radically streamlined process from what has been done before,and we'll have more to say on that possibly next week. And then the Solar Roof tile, we're onversion 3 of the design. That necessarily takes a while to scale up because we have to be confidentthat the Solar Roof is going to last for on the order of 30 years and because the warranty is sort of20, 25 years. And so the rate at which you can iterate on Solar Roof is necessarily slowed down bythe -- according to the rate which you can do accelerated aging on the roof. And we want theinstallation process to be simple and easy.

How soon should current owners that purchased FSD getthe new FSD computer?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI think the -- from features and functionality standpoint, I think there's no point getting the FSDupgrade if you don't really have it in the car for probably about 2 or 3 months. That's when we'llstart releasing features that are materially different from the feature set available on the version 2hardware. So just no need to rush to the -- get your computer replaced. It's like 2 to 3 months beforeit becomes relevant. And then it will obviously increase rapidly from then. One other comment I'llmake in case, since nobody asked this explicitly. For Model Y production, we are right now tryingto decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California or Nevada, and we expect tomake a final decision on that very soon. But in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling andequipment required for Model Y .

2019/7/24,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for your patience. You've joined the Tesla Q2 2019Financial Results and Q&A Webcast. As a reminder, this conference may berecorded.I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Senior Director of Investor Relations, MartinViecha. Sir, you may begin.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Latif, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2019 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of otherexecutives.Our Q3 results were announced at about 1:45 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter we published atthe same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So last quarter, we delivered more than 95,000 vehicles, which is a record for Tesla. Putthat in perspective, it's nearly an 80% increase in deliveries compared to the second quarter of lastyear. I think it's sometimes hard for people to appreciate when you have a large manufactured itemwith a complex global supply chain just how difficult that is. I'm incredibly proud of the Tesla teamfor being able to do that.I think this level of growth is possibly unprecedented. It might be the fastest that any large complexmanufactured item has grown in history. So just, I think, really great work by the Tesla team toachieve that outcome, and we expect growth to continue in the future at -- for several years to comeat the 50% to 100% level. So as I said, I think that is not well appreciated how the quotas grow atthat rate.But achieving record number of deliveries is an important milestone and shows the rapid progresswe've made in managing a global logistics and delivery operation at high volume. And as I said, allof this was achieved thanks to the tremendous hard work of the entire Tesla team.Model 3 is once again the best-selling premium vehicle in the U.S., outselling all of its gas-powered equivalents combined.","The company's Q2 2019 financial results and Q&A Webcast will be available on the company's website.

2019/7/24,"In Europe, Model 3 is approaching sales levels of its established premiumcompetitors, and it was awarded a 5-star rating from Euro NCAP earlier this month. This is inaddition to Model 3 receiving an overall 5-star rating in the U.S. from NHTSA and -- includingearning 5 stars in every category and subcategory and achieving the lowest probability of injury ofany vehicle ever tested.Motor Trend also recently selected Model S as the best vehicle they have ever tested in their 70-year history across all other cars. So Motor Trend, which is arguably the leading authority inevaluating vehicles, the Motor Trend Car of the Year is the most coveted award. It's prettyincredible that they would say that Model S in their entire 70-year history is the best vehicle theyhave ever evaluated. This is despite Tesla not buying any advertising in Motor Trend, and it speaksto their journalistic integrity. That's something special.So -- and since the vehicle that they evaluated, we've actually made -- committed to advancementsof both Model S and Model X, including our recent update of a new suspension with activedamping capability and an all-new drivetrain that's capable of a 370-mile range in the Model S anda 325-mile range in the Model X. We've also issued numerous software updates and improvementsthat have made Model S and Model X faster, safer and added dozens of new features. Just likeModel 3, Model S and X have the hardware needed for future full self-driving capability.As we look ahead to the rest of the year and into 2020, we remain focused on launching newvehicle and energy programs, further expanding on manufacturing operations and continuing toimprove customer service. We remain focused on international expansion because local productionis essential to being cost-competitive. By the end of this year, we will -- we expect to be producingModel 3s in volume out of Gigafactory Shanghai. And as you can see from the photos in ourquarterly letter, the equipment installation there is progressing well. We also have to finalize alocation for our European Gigafactory before the end of the year.Here in Fremont, preparations for Model Y production have already begun. Since Model Y has highcomponent overlap with Model 3, it should be -- we expect it to be a lot easier to ramp. It'ssomething in the order of 3/4 of all the parts are common between Model 3 and Model Y .","In Europe, Model 3 is approaching sales levels of its established premiumcompetitors, and it was awarded a 5-star rating from Euro NCAP earlier this month.

2019/7/24,"And weexpect many manufacturing costs for Model Y , despite additional content, to be approximately thesame as Model 3.This quarter, we opened 25 new service locations and added more than 100 Mobile Service vehiclesto our fleet. And although our fleets have a total -- Tesla fleet size has doubled in the past 12months, which is again just kind of a crazy thing to consider that Tesla is almost doubling allcumulative production every year. This is a totally mad thing to make as many cars in a year aswe've made in our entire history and to have that be an ongoing trend, I think it's difficult for peopleto really feel an exponential. We didn't evolve to feel an exponential. We can feel a linear, but wecan only understand an exponential at a cognitive level.But Tesla is expanding at an exponential rate. And in fact, if you look at the Tesla cumulativedeliveries chart like year-over-year cumulative deliveries, it's about the cleanest exponential graphI've ever seen. So obviously, if that trend continues, the results, I think, are going to be prettyamazing. And I think that will continue.So we've been able to improve service considerably. You can imagine that if -- obviously, if we'redoubling our fleet every year, managing service is quite difficult. It's like a total -- because servicescales as not just with new production but as the total fleet scales, service needs to scale. And wewant to scale service in a way that's sensible from a cost standpoint. But it's really quite a difficultchallenge to scale.Nonetheless, we've made massive improvements in service, especially in parts waiting -- time towait for parts and collision repair. And we've in-sourced a great deal of the collision repairactivities, which has had, I think, quite a good effect on customer happiness. And this will continuein the months to come.So it's a very important milestone. I think we believe Tesla has -- is now at the point of being self-funding, and we expect to be cash flow -- free cash flow Positive in future quarters with the possibletemporary exceptions around the launch and ramp of new product. From a profitability standpoint,we expect to be probably around breakeven this quarter and profitable next quarter. So that's -- I feelpretty confident about that.And then in terms of deliveries, we expect deliveries to be between 360,000 and 400,000.","This quarter, we opened 25 new service locations and added more than 100 Mobile Service vehiclesto our fleet.

2019/7/24,"Weexpect production to be a slightly higher number than that and demand to be a slightly highernumber than that. So people often confuse deliveries, production and orders for Tesla, and they'reactually 3 different numbers. So yes, you obviously cannot deliver more than you make, and sotypically, we will make more than we deliver. And then demand generation activities kind of movein kind of like -- to get together with production like it doesn't make sense to put a lot of effort intodemand generation if production can't meet the demand.And likewise -- so what tends to happen is that we'll solve the production issues, then say, okay, weneed to increase demand -- address demand then we may increase production, then increasedemand. And like I truly get caught up in these details a lot, but if you look at the actual results, likeI said, look at cumulative deliveries over time for Tesla, cleanest exponential we've ever seen,extrapolate that curve.So there's a tremendous amount to be excited about at Tesla, and we'll have more share in thecoming weeks and months. Zach, is there anything you'd like to say about our results?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, sure. And thanks, Elon. A few things I want to highlight before moving into the Q&A. Overall,Q2 was a strong quarter for Tesla. I'm extremely proud of the team for the progress we've made.We've achieved record vehicle production and delivery, record storage production and deployment,record services and other revenue with a corresponding reduced loss. As we've mentioned a fewtimes, we stabilized international logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes. And we sawgross margin improvement in nearly every aspect of the business, adjusting for the impact ofregulatory credit revenue.As a result of these accomplishments, we once again achieved strong free cash flows, which is onlypartially attributed to working capital benefits. We also successfully raised roughly $2.4 billion innet proceeds in May. Thus, we exited the quarter with $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, thehighest in our history. Our net loss reduced significantly relative to Q1, aided by higher volumes inprogress on cost efficiencies.A few things to note. There's $117 million within operating expenses for restructuring. We had asequential reduction of $104 million related to regulatory credit, which is inherently lumpy. And inour other income line, we saw a $66 million reduction.","People often confuse deliveries, production and orders for Tesla, and they'reactually 3 different numbers.

2019/7/24,"This is nearly entirely due to foreignexchange, which we don't hedge.GAAP automotive gross margin only reduced slightly despite the reduction in credit revenue andexpected reductions in our vehicle average selling prices. Adjusting for the impact of credits,automotive gross margin improved materially. For Model S and Model X, ASPs are impacted bypricing actions applied to inventory of vehicles built prior to the launch of our powertrain andsuspension upgrades in April, the majority of which were sold and delivered in Q2.For Model 3, global ASPs stabilized during the quarter at roughly $50,000, a sequential reduction,yet gross profit per Model 3 improved, representing the continued success of our cost managementefforts. Note that we continue to defer a significant portion of revenue associated with full self-driving, which will be recognized in future periods upon the release of additional features.Operating expenses, net of restructuring, continues to improve as well despite the increases involume, reflecting the immense focus on improving our operating efficiency. And while operatingexpenses and capital expenses may appear to be unnaturally low this quarter, that's not the case.Rather, these reflect continued progress on cost efficiency and ability to scale our core technologiesand processes.If we take a step back here, I think it's important to remember that Tesla is on a long-term journey,and it's difficult to see the full picture looking quarter-to-quarter. We committed that Model 3 willbe a transformative product, both for the industry and our business. 3 years ago, we unveiled theModel 3. 2 years ago, we brought the product to market. 1 year ago, we demonstrated our ability tobuild the Model 3 at high rate.So far this year, we've demonstrated our ability to manage global deliveries and logistics at a higherrate, but the most important thing is that we've demonstrated our ability to generate significantorganic demand as nearly all orders generated in Q2 were nonreservation holders. And thus far inQ3, our order pacing is ahead of where we were at this point in Q2. And as we noted in our Q2production and delivery release, our order backlog increased over the course of Q2.Ultimately, the Model 3 is accomplishing what our business needs it to do. It expanded our salesand customer base, enabling us to generate cash we need to reinvest.","GAAP automotive gross margin only reduced slightly despite the reduction in credit revenue andexpected reductions in our vehicle average selling prices.

2019/7/24,"In the process, we'veappropriately managed our operating expenses and have reduced the cost of running the business.This is critically important because I feel as though we've broken through a baseline fixed costbarrier enabled by the success of the Model 3 business.With continued focus on execution and cost management, the next 12 to 18 months should be themost exciting yet. During this time, we believe that Gigafactory Shanghai will be producing atscale. Model Y will be in production, addressing the most popular vehicle segment.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOGenerally on ASP, as we noted in the letter, it was roughly, even over the course of the quarter,stabilized around $50,000. And we have good visibility into where our ASPs are going based onorder data. And so that gives us 1 to 2 months of lead as to where our actual recognized ASPs willbe. And so I would expect some adjustment to our Model 3 ASPs as a result of this pricing change,but the trim mix will offset some of that. And we continue to make great progress on costefficiencies. And so overall in net, our expectation is that the Model 3 gross margin will continue togrow.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. On the gross margin point, like the full self-driving is just an extremely important part of themargin calculation, and the features for full self-driving are -- only a portion of them have rolledout. So the revenue recognition on the full self-driving option is limited at first until those featuresroll out. And also, the demand for the full self-driving package is limited because the features aremostly prospective instead of current. But as those features roll out, I would expect the take rate forfull self-driving to increase significantly as well as the recognition -- revenue recognition of fullself-driving to obviously match the rollout of the product.

I'm halfway expecting some headlines tomorrow of Tesla'sgot too much cash on the balance sheet. I was wondering if you could update us on GigafactoryChina. Don't have a great sense of what delivery volumes in China are for Model 3 at the moment.Some sources are around maybe 3,000 or 4,000 per month.

And that's -- but that's probably a couple yearsbefore -- it's probably 2021 before we have an operational Gigafactory in Europe. And so until thattime, we will source from California. Yes.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystI was wondering if you can comment about whether you felt that Q2 benefited from consumers inthe U.S. sort of rushing out to buy Model 3s in advance of the declining federal tax credit, aphenomenon that you sort of saw in Q4. And part of the reason I ask is, at least by my analysis, itlooks like maybe 70% of the Model 3s sold in the quarter were in the U.S., which is sort of higherthan your normalized percentage of U.S. sales. And so do you feel that, that phenomenon may haveoccurred in Q2? And are you still confident that Q3 deliveries can improve sequentially? Andbeyond the data point that you provided on the call that the orders quarter data are better than lastquarter. Is there anything else you can point to that provides that confidence?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think we'll -- demand in Q3 will exceed Q2. It has thus far, and I think we'll see someacceleration of that. And then I think Q4 will be, I think, very strong. So we expect like quarter-over-quarter improvements. I think Q1 next year will be tough. I think Q3 and 4 will be good. Q1will be tough. Q2 will be not as bad but still tough. And then I would say like Q3 and Q4 next yearwill be incredible.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Just to add on the tax credit step-down, so the step-down from Q2 to Q3 was significantlylower than the step-down from Q4 to Q1. It's also important to keep in mind that there's seasonalityin the auto business in Q1, which also is part of the impact.

Is this going purelyto European OEMs? There's obviously one automaker that you've agreed with. I don't know if thereare any others that you're looking at.

So it's just an honor to work with such agreat team.Q4 -- Q3 was obviously a very strong quarter. And we had record deliveries. We're able to makegreat strides in controlling our costs. We shifted back to GAAP profitability while also generatingstrong free cash flow. And again, this would not be possible without each employee doing their partto reduce cost. Our operating cost is now at the lowest level since Model 3 production started.Regarding Gigafactory Shanghai, this month, we started trial production at Giga Shanghai in bothvehicles from body to paint to general assembly. So this is a -- I want to emphasize, this is a realfactory with a tremendous amount of equipment in it. While a lot of people see the outside shell ofthe factory, which is enormous and it was essentially underwater in January, it was just below thewater table literally, what is, I think, much more significant is that we're able to install massivestamping machines, a fully operational paint shop and a sophisticated general assembly line in thesame period of time in parallel with building the building.

And we hope to announce the location of that Gigafactory -- in fact, we willannounce the location of that Gigafactory before the end of this year.Regarding Model Y , we're also ahead of schedule on Model Y preparations in Fremont.

There may be some room forimprovement there, but we're confident about summer 2020.I've actually recently driven the Model Y Release Candidate, and I think it's going to an amazingproduct and be very well received. I think it's quite likely to -- it's just my opinion, but I think it willoutsell S, X and 3 combined.Regarding Version 10 and Smart Summon, last month, we released our latest software, Version 10,which includes video streaming, games, karaoke, Spotify and a host of other new features andimprovements. Most importantly, it includes the first version of Smart Summon, which has nowbeen used 1 million times. So it's now over 1 million users of Smart Summon. And we're -- in thenext week or so, we will be releasing an improved version of Smart Summon, taking into accountall the data from those 1 million Smart Summon attempts.So this really illustrates the value of having a massive fleet because it allows us to collect thesecorner cases and learn from them and use fleet learning and become rapidly better, just as Navigateon Full Self-Driving did on the freeway.

And this really is just the beginning as we collect more data and Full Self-Driving and FullSelf-Driving functionality gets better.I do -- while it's going to be tight, it still does appear that we will be at least in limited -- in earlyaccess release of a feature-complete Full Self-Driving future this year. So it's not for sure, but itappears to be on track for at least the early access release of a fully functional Full Self-Driving bythe end of this year.And yes, lastly, we're highly focused on decisions that really make a material difference to thecompany such as opening Gigafactories in other continents.","We're also ahead of schedule on Model Y preparations in Fremont.

GAAP automotive gross margin improvedsequentially to 22.8% and over 20% excluding regulatory credits.We achieved these improvements through higher production volumes on S/X and Model 3, enablingbetter fixed cost absorption. We realized improvements in labor hours per vehicle as well as othercosts such as warehousing, logistics, delivery and import-related items. We're also makingcontinued progress reducing material costs, including commercial negotiations with suppliers.Model S and X ASPs increased even accounting for revenue deferrals related to free unlimitedsupercharging.

We're transferring pricing on the website.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorActually, if I may interject a minute, but what a lot of people don't realize is in -- like in Californiaand in a number of other states, if you buy our sort of solar subscription or solar rental, there's nomoney down and you instantly save on your utility bill and there's no long-term contract. So it'skind of a no-brainer. It's really do you want something that prints money? And if it doesn't printmoney, we'll fix it or take it back. It's kind of a no-brainer. And it sort of plays into Tesla'soverarching strategy here, which is effectively to become like a giant distributed global utility onthe energy front.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsYes, absolutely.

That's -- that is unchanged. Anythingyou want to add? I mean, our cash gross margin obviously is higher than our GAAP gross marginbecause of unrecognized revenue associated with FSD attach rates.

Galves - Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research & Senior AnalystI was hoping that you could give us a little bit more color on sizing up the key factors in the autogross margin improvement from Q3 to Q2. Particularly, you mentioned some nonrecurring items inthe letter. And also, should investors be prepared for any meaningful headwinds as the China plantcomes up but isn't at full production yet?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. I can provide a couple of comments on that. So on your final -- on your last question aboutChina headwinds, there are always ramp inefficiencies when we launch a new factory. So we don'texpect China to be any different than that. So there will be some that we experience in Q4. Theamount of that is hard to forecast given that it's a different type of factory design than we did here inFremont. We're working very hard to limit the ramp inefficiencies, but certainly, fixed costabsorption and having all of the labor ready as we ramp will have an impact on Q4.And on the margin improvement, a couple of things there for auto gross margin. As I mentioned inmy opening remarks, S and X average selling prices increased from Q2 to Q3. I mean that'simportant. As I mentioned in the last earnings call, the prior powertrain versions of S and Xprovided significant headwinds on average selling price for that product in the quarter.We've also done a bunch of work as a company to become more targeted in how we adjust pricingon our products and how we optimize that based on local supply and demand. And so I think there'sa bunch of good work from the team on that in Q3, which flowed through on our financials.And cost reduction has just remained a huge focus for us. It's hard to underestimate how much ofthat has been ingrained in the culture of the company. And Jerome and his team have doneabsolutely tremendous work there. So on every line item of our cost, whether it be manufacturing,labor, warehousing, logistics, there's just a tremendous amount of good work that happened there.Specifically on nonrecurring items, to that, I'll note one being the Smart Summon revenuerecognition.

It's a good question. At least based on the plans that we havenow, we're expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model 3 is coming out of our Fremontfactory.

Please go ahead, sir.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2019Q&A Webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of otherexecutives.Our Q4 results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published atthe same link as this webcast.During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. So Q4 was another strong quarter for the company. Deliveries reached over112,000 vehicles in a single quarter. It's hard to think of a similar product with such strong demandthat it can generate more than $20 billion in revenue with 0 advertising spend. I think that's -- wherewe do say that from time to time, I think it's often overlooked, but to have the highest-demandelectric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is, I think, quite remarkable and speaks tothe nature of the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate thatdemand without a bunch of advertising.At our Fremont factory, we're producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in itsrecord year of 2006. And obviously, we expect to exceed that significantly this year. This rate ofproduction was [cheap] before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont. So there's alot of potential to go beyond that number.For the Shanghai factory, I'd like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launchingModel 3 last quarter and achieving the first deliveries earlier this year. I'm really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory. I think it's going to be an incredible asset tothe company. And we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in Shanghai. So a lot of goodprogress there.Regarding Model Y , it was only 10 months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype.","During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.

2020/1/29,"And now inJanuary this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already. Now this is thanks to agreat effort from our engineering team. And we managed to achieve, by far, the highest energyefficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Yall-wheel drive got an EPA rating of 315 miles. This improvement is reflected on the configurator asof today. This is above what we've previously stated by a pretty significant margin. And then justwith great acceleration, top speed, it's really just incredible specs all around.For the Cybertruck, a few months ago, we revealed the -- obviously, remember, we revealed theCybertruck, that was -- that went viral. And we tried to build a product that -- a product that issuperior in every way without any preconceptions of how such a product should look. So it reallyjust -- from the standpoint of what's the most badass, futuristic, armored personnel carrier that kicksthe ass of any other pickup truck, basically that's the goal. And we wanted it to look like somethingthat just kind of came out of a sci-fi movie set from the future. And the demand has been incredible.We've never seen actually such a level of demand at this -- we've never seen anything like it,basically. I think we will make as -- about as many as we can sell for many years. So as many -- wewill sell as many as we can make. It's going to be pretty nuts.

Thanks, Martin. This past year was truly transformational for Tesla, and I want to thankeveryone who's been a part of making this happen.On 2019, a few key points I'd like to highlight. On demand, while we've mentioned this a fewtimes, it's worth highlighting once again. Over the course of the year, we've transitioned entirelyfrom generating Model 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.We've also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs, even increasing slightly in Q4. And we've seen anincrease in ASPs of S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.With respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch ofModel 3 in Fremont and Reno. As a result, we've been able to bring new production capacity onboard faster and with less cost. This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in Shanghai as well asModel Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched in under one year.Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled throughhigher volumes, improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management andcontinued improvement in our product and operational costs. And we are able to achieve PositiveGAAP net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled strong cashgeneration.","This past year was truly transformational for Tesla, and I want to thankeveryone who's been a part of making this happen.

2020/1/29,"Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. We are going to take the first questions from retail investors compiled by SayTechnologies.So the first retail investor question is, ""since solar is required for all new home constructions inCalifornia, do you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large Californiahomebuilders that you can share? What's the 2020 target for the number of Solarglass Roofinstallations in California?""Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I think we do -- we are seeing, mostly from a small base, exponential growth in demand andoutput for solar -- for the Solarglass Roof. So it's difficult to predict what the demand will be thisyear, except that the demand is very strong. And we are working also not just through Tesla SolarRoof but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whetherit's in North America, on the order of 4 million new roofs per year. So we see a lot of interest.And so it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do theinstallation. But over time, I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something touse Solarglass in one form or another. It's really going to be a choice of do you want a roof that isalive with power or dead without. And I think people will want a live roof that generates power andlooks good and lasts a long time, and it's the future we want.So it will be a significant product, but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product andthere's a lot of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome, and this will be a major productline of Tesla. And the Buffalo factory is doing great. So, yes.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you.

I think some of our learnings during the Model 3 launch periodwere we grew too quickly and with too much complexity, and it held back our ability to continue toscale. And part of the journey that we've been on in 2019 is to unwind a series of unintentional badprocesses that kind of accumulated in the company over time. And so that's kind of whatcontributes to the reduction in OpEx over the year as we get smarter about that.And now we've laid a good foundation, I think. And I agree with you on that, we're not holdingback on the growth. I mean we have 2 products -- 2 vehicle products launching right now.

First question related to Cybertruck. You mentioned you'll sell asmany as you can make. Can you remind me how many you think you can make? And any thoughtson the cost of production for making those Cybertrucks?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we don't comment on those detailed numbers, except the demand is just far more than wecould reasonably make in the space of, I don't know, 3 or 4 years or something like that. So thething we're going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that'svery fundamental because if you don't improve battery production capacity, then you end up justshifting unit volume from one product to another, and you haven't actually produced more electricvehicles.So that's part of the reason why we have not, for example, really accelerated production of the TeslaSemi because it does use a lot of cells. And unless we've got a lot of battery cells available, then saylike accelerated production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making fewer Model 3or Model Y cars. So we've got to really make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery productionand continue to improve the cost per kilowatt hour of the batteries.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Directorfor Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2020 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ1 results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.This is the first time we have achieved Positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatorycredits, while ramping 2 major products. What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviouslylearned a lot here. After all -- after the Model 3 ramp from 3 years ago, our new products get runfaster and become profitable sooner. In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter thanModel 3s in Fremont in the first 2 quarters. Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster thanthe Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1. Most surprisingly is, otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule thatwe were ahead of already. Most surprisingly -- Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter ofproduction, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.Regarding Full Self-Driving, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to earlyaccess users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week. Ourcars will now automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic lights until the driver gets aconfirmation to proceed.","The conference call is being recorded.

We are collecting data from over 1 million intersections every month at thispoint. This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people startdriving again. Soon, we will be collecting data from over 1 billion intersections per month. All of those confirmations are training on neural net. Essentially, the driver when driving and takingaction is effectively labeling the -- labeling reality as they drive, and it makes them really get betterand better. I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we're quite literally orders ofmagnitude more than everyone else combined. I think this is difficult to fully appreciate. It's thereason I'd say it's very difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google becauseeveryone is training Google all the time with their searches. So when you search something, andyou click on a link, you're training Google every time you do that. It's just very difficult for any newsearch engine to compete on that basis.So all those confirmations are training on neural net, and soon cars will be able to drive through anintersection without a confirmation as well as to make turns. And we really feel we're -- I feelextremely confident that it will be possible to do a drive from your home to your office most of thetime with no interventions by the end of the year. So this is -- we can almost do this already with theleading-edge alpha builds driving in the car.So let's see, on other technology fronts, we increased the range of Model S and X yet again, thistime to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X. Actually, we said that, actually, themodel -- the real Model S range is 400 miles. But when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately, EPAhad left the car door opened and the keys in the car. So the car -- and they did this overnight. And sothe car actually went into waiting-for-driver mode and lost 2% of its range and, as a result, had a391 test.","The car is actually capable of much more than this, but weare only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel that it is probably asafety improvement.

2020/4/29,"As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we're actually confidentthat we will achieve a 400-mile or greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S forthe past 2 months -- the true range of the Model S for the past 2 months has been 400 miles. And ofcourse, we're not stopping there. We're looking -- we're going to continue pushing for improvedrange over time and improving handling, acceleration and all the little details that make Teslaspecial.For Model Y , we introduced a revolutionary 2-piece rear underbody casting, but we are going to bemaking a single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body iscast as a single piece, which is no casting of this size and complexity has ever been done before. Infact, there isn't even anything that is on par with the 2-piece casting for the Model Y . So we're reallypushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing. I'm very excited aboutthis approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH. It's better in everyway, essentially.We also -- for Model Y , we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car tohave a higher range. So the Model Y has remarkable range, on par with -- in fact, slightly betterthan, I guess, the Model 3, and despite being a bigger car that weighs more. And the heat pump is akey contributor to that. It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving. So -- and the feedbackwe're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally Positive.We're confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.So in conclusion, and just looking -- I guess this is a forward-looking statement, we are absolutelycontinuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai,and here in Fremont when they will let us continue. Localized production in China and in Europewill bring the costs down, making our products even more competitive over time. While many othercompanies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite. We are absolutely pedal tothe metal on new products and expanding the company.","For Model Y , we introduced a revolutionary 2-piece rear underbody casting, but we are going to bemaking a single-piece casting later this year.

And now to Zach's opening remarks.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thanks, Martin, and thanks, Elon. I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla teamthis past quarter. A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned. We successfullylaunched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y , as Elon mentioned, significantlyahead of schedule. This is our second large-scale product launch since Model 3 in 2017, and it'sevidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp efficiency. It's hard to understate thesignificance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of production.Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents ofModel 3s built in Fremont. This is despite not yet running at full capacity while also managingthrough the production shutdown in early February. We also announced a long-range andperformance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will Positively impact ASPs in China.On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of governmentincentives at the end of Q4. In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit. Automotive grossmargin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products despite chargestaken in Q1 associated with production downtime. We continue to make progress on OpExefficiency as well as our service and other margins. Our energy business was impacted as well byshutdown activities in Q1, limiting deployments. We also experienced expected launchinefficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted overallprofitability.As I've noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which are credits we sell to other carmakers,to generally increase with time. This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.","Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla teamthis past quarter.

2020/4/29,"And notethat most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it's reflected in the accountsreceivable on the balance sheet.Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary increase in end-of-quarter inventory for all ourproducts resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations. Had theseinterruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong freecash flows.As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-termplans and technology road map. We are taking the near-term actions required to continue thoseinvestments. Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned, and we're makingprogress on improving capacity for Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai. In the near term,our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows andprofitability to the company. In Fremont, we're working towards restarting production as soon asthat's possible.We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.Our vehicle inventory balance increased by 14,000 units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind tofree cash flows in Q1, but it's helpful in Q2. Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Yin Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locallyproducing and delivering vehicles.While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receivingmany online orders despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-termfinancial performance, and we will need to work through how quickly we'll be able to rampproduction to prior levels. More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows aremanaged appropriately. Working capital management, in particular raw material inventory, is thesingle most important lever in managing our cash flows during this time. The Tesla team has done agreat job here. We've also taken actions to eliminate or reduce noncritical expenses and optionalinvestments while continuing to drive efficiencies throughout the business.Overall, we've modeled many scenarios into 2021 and remain comfortable that we have sufficientliquidity to proceed fully with our most important long-term investments.

2020/4/29,"Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. So we'll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by SayTechnologies. The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet topurchase or experience FSD despite most vehicles having all the necessary hardware. What leverscould you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage? For example, could youconsider offering FSD as a premium subscription?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards theend of this year. I should say it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as, in our view, buyingFSD is an investment in the future. And we are confident that it is an investment that will pay off tothe consumer and to the benefit of the consumer. In my opinion, buying FSD option is somethingpeople will not regret doing.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOI agree. And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in thevehicle or a lease is -- will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preservethe option value of increased value of time. But we do understand that some customers who haveownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront. And so this will enablethose customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely. As you may be like, at a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area underthe curve of customer happiness. That is our goal. And we think that that's the kind of thing that allcompanies should try to do. And it's what results in long-term value creation. And loyalty begetsloyalty. So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we're confident thatif we behave like that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you.

2020/4/29,"To what extentis there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer sothey can qualify for the subsidy?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production cost in China. And we're actuallyexcited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3basically tomorrow, China time. So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, Chinatime. And that will be a price below the subsidy limit. And we feel confident that, that will still be avehicle that delivers a good gross margin.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced inShanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's stillsignificant opportunity left to take cost out. So our fixed cost absorption from higher productionvolumes, which are occurring in Q2, will occur through the rest of the year. We're not fullylocalized on the supply chain yet. And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it's notcomplete, and there's additional opportunities there. And so we'll continue to bring the price downand expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this reduction in price that Elonmentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.That's -- one always has to do that in a crisis. And just thinking about our core beliefs and what dowe want to do, and we came to a conclusion that the right move is actually to continue to expandrapidly, continue to invest in the future and in new technologies, even though it is risky.

And the last question from institutional investors, could you please update on progresstowards development and commercialization of Full Self-Driving? How much revenue have yourecognized so far?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSo there's a couple of things on the financials for Full Self-Driving. So currently, in North America,it's sold for $7,000 as an option. We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of itgoes into deferred revenue. That's associated with features that will be released with time. Ourdeferred revenue balance is continuing to grow. It's a little bit over $600 million. And so as werelease features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have beenreleased, the associated value, and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into ourfinancials for that quarter. And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we canrecognize that revenue. So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenuewithin period. So I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful grossmargin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorAbsolutely. There's also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the fleet out there that couldupgrade to turn on Full Self-Driving -- basic Full Self-Driving or Full Self-Driving. And that's something that wewill enable just as simple in-app purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the end of theyear, as a subscription.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWe were actually gaining tremendous momentum with the Solar Roof before COVID, but COVIDessentially shut us down, both from the ability to install and the ability to get permits, like permitoffices were closed. And with the shelter-in-place all over the places, so we obviously cannotinstall. And if you can't get permits, then you can't physically do it. It's physically impossible. So --but I think the long-term trend for Solar Roof is extremely good, and I'm confident that, let's say,within the next, I don't know, year -- maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of1,000 a week. That's not in the middle of winter or something. It's like taking seasonality --allowing for seasonality where it's hard to install on roofs that are covered in snow and ice, but likein, say, spring, I think installing, which is the hard part, we actually have demonstrated the ability tohit 1,000 a week gross build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already, so that's not a problem. It'sbuilding up the install teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industryinstallers.And internally, we want to have at least 1,000 Solar Roof install teams with -- and taking a week orperhaps a little less than a week to do an install, which gets you 1,000 a week roof installations. Wesee demand is good. Production is good. So it's really all about the install. And then like I said alsobuilding out the -- training the very diverse group of companies in the roofing industry to alsoinstall Solar Roof that I think will scale -- allow us to scale far beyond 1,000 a week. We're alsoseeing a lot of interest outside of North America.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorZach?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. A couple of thoughts there for Y . The first is it does carry a higher ASP. So on the revenueside, it carries a higher ASP than Model 3. And the deliveries that we started with were of thehigher ASP versions of the cars. So we started with deliveries of performance initially. And so thathelps create some of the margin.

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOne on gross margin, first, and your impressive performance in Q1. So there are 3 moving parts: thetailwind from credits, of course; the Model Y ramping, even if it broke even, it probably tookaverage gross margin down; and of course, you had like Fremont being closed, shut down the lastweek of the quarter, it probably was the sort of an extra cost. And so when I looked at how grossmargin evolved sequentially, excluding these 3 moving parts, I felt like your auto gross margincould have been up like a couple of points sequentially. So I wanted to check with you if thatestimate would make sense. And then I will have a follow-up on energy storage.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSequential market improvement -- margin improvement?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. So the 3 things that you mentioned, I had a little bit of a hard time hearing the full questionhere because we're having a bit of network difficulty in the room. I'll do my best here. So when welook at margin, we do exclude credit, as you have, so I agree with that. Model Y ramping, bringingdown overall gross margin, I agree with that as well. So it was lower than the overall average, andthat will increase with time. And shutdown and efficiencies in both Shanghai and in Fremont alsoweighed on margin, and the Shanghai margin was below the average as well.

Thewhole Tesla team was super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for futureexpansion of Tesla down the road.Let's see. Is there anything more we want to say about? There's a lot of information. So anything,guys? All right. Well, I'm sure there'll be lots of questions.We've already started work on the facility, so some initial construction work. So it's alreadyunderway, started this weekend. Let's see, moving on to other subjects.Solar. We recently adjusted the pricing of our retrofit solar. So Tesla Solar is the lowest cost solar inthe United States. And we added the lowest cost guarantee and a money-back guarantee. So we'revery confident that people will have our solar product, whether it's the solar retrofit or Solar Roof.Our solar is now 30% cheaper than the U.S. average. After the federal tax credit, Tesla Solar nowcosts $1.49 per watt. And it's a very simple, highly automated single-click experience.

So thisgives us a unique advantage in terms of information.","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Version 0.9 is it getting at least. 300 is going to be the new normal, close to 500 kilometers basically roughly. That's a standard expectation because you do need to take intoaccount, like, is it very hot outside or very cold? Or are you driving up into a mountain with a fullload? And it's -- people don't want to have a -- get to their destination with like a 10 miles range.They want some reasonable margins. So I think 300 is really -- or close to 300 is Going to Be the New normal. Martin Viecha - Senior Director for IRThe next question on insurance. What is the holdup for Tesla insurance outside of California? Willyou release numbers from that part of the business? Will Tesla Insurance be required to participatein the Tesla ride-hailing network as a driver?",Neutral,0.69951683,Automotive

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean at the heart of being competitive with insurance is what is the accuracy of yourinformation. Like are you dealing with -- are you forced to assess people statistically looking in therear-view mirror? Or can you assess people individually, looking ahead with smart projections, andinform the driver that -- of how they may reduce their -- what actions they can take to reduce theirinsurance. As Zach was alluding to, it's like, okay, you're driving too fast, you're doing this or thator the other thing, it's like if you want to pay more for insurance, you can. But if you want to payless, then please don't drive so crazy. Then people can make a choice. Like, okay, they want to driveaggressively, in that case, it'll be higher insurance, or if they want -- they're more careful in theirdriving, they pay less.This was actually very helpful for us to have a feedback loop to see what is driving insuranceexpense.","Elon R.

2020/7/22,"A lot of it is just -- it's like a little fender bender and the net fender bender because of theway that the body collision repairs being done cost like $15,000 or something crazy, and like, well -- and then we can actually adjust the design of the car and adjust how the repair is done to actuallyhave the fundamental cost of solving that problem would be less.So this has helped us unearth a whole bunch of silly things that we were doing basically withoutrealizing it. But this is a problem, in general, with insurance, is like if the insurance is like all youcan eat, then the feedback loop for improvement is sweet. So this gives us a great feedback loop forimprovement because it's basically a fundamentally better insurance product.I'd also like to say, in the spurt of recruiting because if there's one thing I'd like to come out of thiscall, it's that a lot of great people want to join Tesla.

2020/7/22,"Our first question will come from Dan Levy with Cr???©dit Suisse.Dan Meir Levy - Cr???©dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystI'll ask a question on the quarter and then just a question more broadly on strategy. Just on thequarter, if you could give us an update on gross margin. Was China accretive to gross margin in thesecond quarter? And give us an idea of how far off Model Y gross margin was versus FremontModel 3?And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in-sourcing is varying byregion. You're in-sourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you're relying a lot more on the supply chainin Shanghai. What do you expect your approach to be on insourcing when you eventually open upBerlin and what your Texas factory is going to be?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Just to start with the gross margin questions. We did see progress on gross margins in China,and that was despite pricing action that was taken. The factory is still not running at full capacityyet as it continues to ramp. So we think there's a continued opportunity to optimize the coststructure there.Model Y , as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production. And despitethe inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see a pretty substantial improvement inthe Model Y margin. And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structurewill converge. They're not quite there. Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, andit's not yet at full production. And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kindof back into the math there on the relative gross margins.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory. But -- and it's continuing to do more andmore internally. But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton ofparts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from everypart of the world.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystYou mentioned in the slide deck a couple of times that you were pleased with gross margin, withPTI margin progress and you expect it to achieve industry-leading operating margins over time.Maybe you could shed a little light on that. Industry-leading for luxury vendors is 8% to 10% PTI.For Porsche, smaller, at 17%. For mass market vendors, it's 5% to 8%. What do we think about?And how much, ultimately, do you believe that EV credits will contribute to that margin? Because Iknow your margin has been 5% over the last 12 months, but it's actually less than 1% excluding EVcredits. So it's a 4-point contribution right now. How do we think about ultimately what industry-leading margins are? And how much of that you think is coming from EV credits, regulatorycredits? And I have a follow-up, please.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. I've mentioned this before in terms of regulatory credit. We manage the business -- or saiddifferently, we don't manage the business with the assumption that regulatory credits will contributein a significant way to the future. I do expect regulatory credit revenue to double in 2020 relative to2019, and it will continue for some period of time. But eventually, the stream of regulatory creditswill reduce.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean it's worth noting that we're -- buyers of our car in the U.S. received 0 federal tax credit.Whereas many of our competitors are like, they get a $7,500 fed tax credit. And yet our sales havecontinued to do well. Yes.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce, manufacture and distributeour cars. That cost curve even for mature products like the S and the X continues to come down, aswe work on that, Model 3, which is our second most mature product, that continues to come down.You then layer on top of that, as Elon was discussing earlier, the potential for software-basedrevenue, particularly Full Self-Driving.

Sacconaghi - Sanford C.

So how do you think about that trade-off betweendriving towards industry-leading profitability, yet trying to make your cars more affordable andbroader? It feels like, historically, you've always picked the path of, I'd rather drive more growthand more adoption because ultimately, that's the mission of the company. And we even saw it a littlebit this quarter with price reductions. You could have probably kept price where it is, sold someunits and had better profits, but that's been an ongoing choice that Tesla, as a company, has made.So how do you personally think about that trade-off between -- even if you were to get to industry-leading margins, wouldn't you be inclined to give more of that back to drive greater adoption morequickly?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I think we actually achieved both when you factor in autonomy. I think we can go waybeyond industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people and potentiallyalmost everyone when you're factoring in autonomy. That was really a mega game changer, gigagame changer. Yes. But I mean it is important for people to distinguish between 2 things. There'svalue for money that our product has, and then there's affordability.

I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ3 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. All right. So Q3 was our best quarter in history. We achieved record production anddeliveries, record revenue, record net income, both GAAP and non-GAAP, and record free cashflow of $1.4 billion. This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team. I could not bemore proud to work with such a great group of people. Just really (expletive) performance across --throughout the world.Of course, we had our Battery Day. So we hosted -- showed our plans for how we can expand in thefuture and improve core battery technology, core cell technology at the form factor level, chemistrylevel and I think most significantly at the manufacturing technology level. There's only -- acomment I made in the past is that I think Tesla's long-term competitive strength will be primarilymanufacturing. This is counterintuitive, but I'm quite confident this will be what happens.All right. So we presented what the team has been working on for a long time with batteries. Wewanted to step back and really rethink batteries from scratch. First principles thinking, just look at itfrom fundamental physics and say what -- rather than compare to other products in the market, justsay from a physics standpoint, if you -- what's the limit of physics? What's the platonic idea of aperfect cell and how close can we get there? And that was our aspiration.","Elon Musk: Q3 was our best quarter in history.

2020/10/21,"And I think we've got apretty good approach to it, which will only get better over time. And we went through all of theinteresting solutions for every important part of battery design and production. And we'll continueto iterate on that and just recursively improve the core cell and battery technology. The result, we think, in a few years, will be batteries that cost half as much and where the capitalexpenditures required are 1/3 or less of what they are today. And we expect Giga Berlin will see ourfirst battery cell production line at scale.Regarding the Full Self-Driving beta release. The Full Self-Driving team, again, just a really all-star team. Ispent a lot of time with the Full Self-Driving team. And there's a lot of really talented people in that teamwho've worked incredibly hard to make the -- to get the beta release out. So I'd just really like tothank them for their hard work. And it's just a very smart group of people. So I think we're startingvery slow and very cautiously because the world is a complex and messy place. And so we're -- weput it out there last night, and then we'll see how it goes and then probably release it to more peoplethis weekend or early next week. And then just gradually step it up until we have, hopefully, a widerelease by the end of this year.And of course, as the system collects more data and -- it becomes more robust. So it's sort of likehow does Google as a search engine get better. It's because everyone is programming it by askingquestions all the time and clicking on particular links. So it's got this great feedback loop, and thatmakes it an extremely effective search engine. It's the same thing for autonomy. Having on theorder of 1 million cars that are providing feedback and specifically feedback on strange corner casesituations that you just can't even come up with in simulation, this is the thing that is reallyvaluable. It's not like the obvious stuff, obvious stuff you can do in simulation. But weird cornercases, only a reality can give you that. So that's -- but we're able to say, okay, we need to train thesystem on this corner case situation and look for examples so we can then try it against thoseexamples and improve some very esoteric corner cases.And it's also important to emphasize that this is a generalized neural net-based approach.","The Full Self-Driving team, again, just a really all-star team.

2020/10/21,"So it's really one of the most difficult challenges I've ever seen.So let's see. In conclusion, thank you. What we've achieved would not be possible without theincredible hard work of tens of thousands of Tesla employees and all people at our suppliers aswell. I'd like to thank our suppliers. We continue to grow as fast as we can while focusing on costcontrol and improving quality. And ultimately, the best company will be that which makes greatproducts at an affordable price, and that's our goal. I think I've never felt more optimistic about thefuture of Tesla than I do today. I'd also like to thank investors who have stuck with us through thickand thin. This is -- I think there's a lot more good stuff to come.All right. With that, we can move to questions.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Elon. I think our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, has some opening remarks as well.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorOkay. Sure.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. Overall, our financial health continues to rapidly improve with Q3 beinganother great quarter on nearly all dimensions, as Elon has mentioned. On net income, we achievedour fifth sequential quarter of profitability, our best net income, and nearly double-digit operatingmargins.Two things that are important to note to set context for Q3 profitability. First, the regulatory creditsbusiness was stronger than our expectations, and we are tracking to more than double this yearcompared to last. Second, as a result in the rise of the market cap of the company, the second andthird tranche of the CEO grant vested during the quarter. Additionally, we have begun expensing 1more tranche, resulting in roughly $300 million of combined period expense.I think it's reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the healthof the core business.On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from 18.7% to23.7%, with some of our programs achieving greater than 25% gross margin. Keep in mind thatinefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2. We continue to reduce ourmanufacturing and operational costs. We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend oflocally built and delivered cars, which has increased from under 50% at the beginning of last year toover 70% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction strategy.","Elon Musk: What we've achieved would not be possible without theincredible hard work of tens of thousands of Tesla employees and all people at our suppliers aswell. I'd like to thank our suppliers. We continue to grow as fast as we can while focusing on costcontrol and improving quality. And ultimately, the best company will be that which makes greatproducts at an affordable price. That's our goal. I think I've never felt more optimistic about thefuture of Tesla than I do today.

2020/10/21,"While thisgoal remains a genuine challenge, we believe it's possible with tight execution across the company.So congratulations again to the Tesla team for a great quarter and a great year. I'll hand it over to RJJohnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a fewcomments.RJ Johnson - Tesla, Inc. - Global Head of Commercial EnergyThank you, Zach. First, I'd like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done. Q3 wasa strong quarter for the Energy business, and we're poised for continued strong growth in Energystorage and solar. Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business, anddeployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity. We have moredemand than supply through 2021, and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedenteddemand across the globe through 2023 and beyond. Our order book is rapidly filling up through2023 in a multiple gigawatt-hour scale.Large-scale solar plus storage is now more cost-effective than traditional fossil fuel generation inmany locations across the globe. This trend will continue as we remove cost, which will furtherdisplace existing and new fossil fuel generation. This is true for stand-alone storage as well.Many customers are utilizing Autobidder to maximize returns as we optimize our hardware andsoftware with advanced real-time bidding strategies that continue to outperform the market wheredeployed. For Powerwall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seekincreased reliability and backup home generation. We have a very large backlog of Powerwallorders, and we continue to invest to increase capacity to fulfill customer orders. We're just nowcapturing the full power of customer-sited solar plus storage as customers in some jurisdictions areproviding services back to the grid when they don't need to consume energy or have backup power.This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally.In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $1.49 a watt after taxincentives, which is the lowest in the industry. We're able to do this by leveraging our online vehicleordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft costs associated with sales andmarketing. As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiencyincrease, leading to increased profitability in the retrofit business.","Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we're poised for continued strong growth in Energystorage and solar.

We've recently demonstrated ourability to complete Solar Roof installation in just 1 day. Please note, this still requires 1 to 2 days toremove the existing roof and prepare it for the Solar Roof installation. Clearly, there will be a rangeof installation times based on size, complexity, weather and other factors. Overall, our reducedinstallation time provides a better customer experience and will enable the business to growexponentially as scale effects allow for increased efficiency.In closing, we believe the Energy segment is poised for a strong growth as we continue to focus onincreasing scale while reducing cost to maximize profitability.

2020/10/21,"Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, everyone. And let's begin with questions from say.com. The first questionfrom retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start 4680 cell production at Giga Berlin at the sametime as vehicle production? Can Tesla share more information on what products will use the batterycells from the pilot line in Fremont?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Drew, do you want to take that?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSure. Yes, we will incorporate 4680 design solutions into many applications in time across bothenergy and vehicle. And we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the newfactory in Berlin as it ramps.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. Let's go to the next question, which is question #2 from retail shareholders.Does Tesla's tabless cell design allow for significantly higher peak charging rates? Does it improvethe required taper curve?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. The fundamental limitation on charge rate in lithium-ion batteries is avoiding lithium platingon the anode. And while the tabless architecture helps avoid overheating because it's a more power-dense architecture at high continuous charge rates, it doesn't change the anode plating story. Electrodesign and anode material choice more directly determines the maximum charge rate and how toavoid that lithium plating problem.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Thank you very much. The third question from retail is, would FSD be able to be transferredto our next vehicle or pay a transfer fee? It would add a broad -- it would add to brand loyalty thesame way gaming companies and cellphone companies keep you in their ecosystem by letting youtransfer purchases to upgraded hardware.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think we'll give it some thought.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay.

Looked like you could be approachingsomething like 20 million vehicles by 2030 if you hit those goals. Could you maybe share with us alittle bit more of a midterm target, like where would you be by 2025?

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean I think the tricky thing with trying to predict things midway through an exponential isthat if things are doubling every year or even just growing 50%, then if you shift 1 -- plus/minus 1year, it has a huge effect on the number. So -- and it sounds like, wow, you either massivelyexceeded or massively undershot. But it's -- actually, what's going on is a giant S-curve. So a wholebunch of pretty big S-curves that integrate into a gigantic S-curve. So that's why it's difficult topredict the middle. And I'm not saying for sure we'll hit 20 million vehicles. But it does seem like agood goal to have because that would mean that we're replacing 1% of the global fleet per year.And it's difficult to say that we're -- are we really changing the world if we're not switching out 1%of the global fossil fuel vehicles? I mean it's -- I'm not sure that we can make that argument unlesswe change at least 1% of the vehicles per year. So that's where the 2 -- the 20 million vehicle peryear comes from. It's like 1% of 2 billion vehicles, which is the global fleet currently. The globalfleet is growing. So probably will be a bit bigger in the future. So it's hard to say.

It'snot particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter. With respect to product margins,what we're seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really across every product.Shanghai continues to make good progress there. Model Y cost is also coming down quite quicklyas we ramp that. But we've guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to theModel 3 built in Fremont costs. It's not quite there, and it's also a bit of a moving target. As Model 3Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to come down with that.

Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So just to recap the year, 2020 was a defining year for us on many levels. Despite achallenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5million cars. And I'd just like to once again thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort. Wedelivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history. So really an incrediblegrowth rate and despite a very challenging 2020. So my hat is off. It's such an honor to work withsuch great people at Tesla.So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3billion on building new factories and other expenditures. We reached industry-leading GAAPoperating margins in addition to Positive net income and record cash flow.Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of newcapacity. We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and almost reached full productionspeed. We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, andShanghai continues to grow rapidly. We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.We ramped the single piece -- we started and we're able to ramp to volume production the single-piece castings for Model Y .","Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives will discuss Tesla's Q4 2020 Financial Results and Q&A Webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

2021/1/27,"This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeletonof the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in 1 year. We're also building Giga Berlinand Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year. And lastly, we built a cell -- abattery cell factory in the Bay Area. And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity islarge enough that it would be in the -- probably the top 10 battery cell factories on earth despitebeing a pilot plant.Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we're super excited to announce the newModel S and Model X Plaid are in production now and will be delivered in February. So we've beenable to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X. And so Model S will be delivered in February andModel X a little later. For the Model S Plaid, we're actually in production now and we'll bedelivering next month.So this is a tri-motor Model S with a completely new interior. There are actually a lot of great thingsabout this. I'll do another call about the Model S later. But it's really a tremendous improvementover the prior version.And the Model S will be the first -- this Model S Plaid will be the first production car ever that isable to go 0 to 60 miles an hour in under 2 seconds. So no production car ever has been able to getbelow 2 seconds, 0 to 60. This is a luxury sedan that is able to go 0 to 60 in less than 2 seconds andwill have the ability to seat up to 7 people with the third-row seats.So this is pretty nice. This is faster, to be clear, than any car. It's not like there was a different typeof car, like a 2-door sports car that was able to do fast -- it's the fastest accelerating car ever madefor -- that is allowed to go on roads in history. And like I said, we'll start delivering it in a matter ofweeks.And actually, we'll obviously get into the details what the Model S changes may be later this weekor next. But it's really better in many ways.","We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in 1 year.

2021/1/27,"We will be actually raising the price of Model S forthese new models of -- the old model -- the new model will be $10,000 more. So hopefully, peoplearen't too upset if they bought the old model last month. But this one, $10,000 more. So yes, wethink it's probably the best car of any kind at any price available in the world today.So then with regard to Full Self-Driving, we've made massive progress on Full Self-Driving. Irecommend watching the videos of our public beta. So we've got, I think, almost 1,000 people inthe beta at this point. And with each successful release of the beta FSD software, it just gets -- it'sreally improving rapidly. It's not very common for -- I drive the latest roads.It's very common for me to have no interventions on drives that I do, including drives to a place thatI've never been to. So these are not preplanned routes. The car has never been there before. And it'snow actually more -- it's more common than not for the car to have no interventions, even on acomplex drive. So -- and this is -- basically, I'm highly confident the car will be able to drive itselfwith reliability in excess of human this year. This is a very big deal.And thinking about like how does one justify the value of the company being where it is, I thinkthere is a way, just with back-of-the-envelope math, to potentially justify it, where if Tesla ships,let's say, hypothetically, $50 billion or $60 billion worth of vehicles and those vehicles become FullSelf-Driving and can be used in robotaxis -- used as robotaxis, the utility increases from an averageof 12 hours a week to potentially an average of 60 hours a week if they're capable of serving asrobotaxi. So that's like roughly a 5x increase in utility.But let's -- even if you say like, okay, let's just assume that the car becomes twice as useful as -- not5x as useful but merely twice as useful, that would be a doubling again of the revenue of thecompany, which is almost entirely gross margin. So it would mean -- it would be like if you made$50 million -- $50 billion worth of cars, it will be like having [$50 million] of incremental profitbasically from that because of the software.So -- and if that was the case, then yes, you get 20 PE on that.","Tesla will be raising the price of Model S forthese new models of -- the old model -- the new model will be $10,000 more.

2021/1/27,"It's like $1 trillion and the company isstill in high-growth mode. So I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of thecompany where it is using just the cars and nothing else, the cars with FSD. And I suspect at least anumber of investors are taking that approach.So in conclusion, while 2020 was a turning point for Tesla in terms of profitability, we believe thisis just the beginning. We think 2021 is going to be even more exciting. And you don't know what toexpect in a given year. Obviously, last year, we did not -- there were many things we did not expect.But assuming that '21 is a relatively normal year from an external standpoint, I think it's going to bea great year for Tesla.We've got a ton of -- many great new products coming out. We've got factories that are -- advancedfactories that can start production. It will also make it easier how you're having a factory in Berlin,one, and in Texas second, just from a logistics standpoint. And Texas can help supply the Easternhalf of the U.S. and Berlin can help supply Europe. And there's just fewer cars on boats, much lesscapital tied up with built cars that are on boats or going -- being transported to customers.

And now we can jump straight into questions from Say Technologies.The first question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from beingthe market share leader in solar?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So we're actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year. And we hadour best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4. So we do expect to become the market share leader insolar and then go far beyond it. It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had todevote the whole company to Model 3 production and building. And so we actually basically takethe whole company, including a lot of people that were on solar, and have them work on cars. Butnow we got a little more bandwidth, we're putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growingrapidly. So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOAnother really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure,which then allows us to have industry-leading pricing. And so that's something that we'veaccomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the place that it needs to be.And as Elon mentioned, this is a really important part with industry-leading pricing to become theleader in the space.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And actually, an important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwalland the Tesla retrofit solar and Tesla roof. And we're confident we'll have excellent integration --excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar, whether it's retrofit or the Tesla SolarglassRoof before the end of the year.So it's really -- I think we've got a good strategy. As Zach mentioned, we're focused on reducing theamount of time and the complexity of the install, and we're making great progress in that regard.And I think we'll have something that's really dialed in this year.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you.

The Kato team, however, has been able to solve eachmanufacturing problem presented to date and continues to improve yield and rate week-over-weekand month-over-month as we move up the production S-curve. At the same time, the cellengineering team's refined designs and deepened understanding has reinforced our confidence in thedrive process and 4680 design, meeting our performance and cost targets.And from a capacity perspective, we have 10 gigawatt hours worth of equipment landed at Kato.The production staff is nearly all hired. Our material supply chain is established and the team is ontrack for full production ramp this year.

And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in NorthAmerica. We're trying to push that to 50% this year. And 50% of service visits last less than 2hours.

So that's whatwe're doing to improve service.In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app. Really, we want all communications to go throughthe app, the Tesla app, and we're trying to move away from the phone. The app is much better thanthe phone. It can start directly -- alerts directly from the car and schedule a service appointment.And there is a written record of all communication between the customer and the service team.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, it is. So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability ofcells, what's the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours. And you can't grow faster than that.

And withsome slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with the Standardpack, an order of 500 kilometers. So there's efficiency improvements in the car. But fundamentally,the growth is dependent on cell production. And there's obviously a lot of other companies thatwant to -- that have a need for cells.So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.
