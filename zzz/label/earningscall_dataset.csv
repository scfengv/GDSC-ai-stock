"Elon Musk: I think the newsletter probably speaks for itself, but I'll add some commentary on some of the lead points. We had a huge increase in Model S deliveries year-on-year in Q4 last year, going up 76%. And then we feel pretty good about where we're tracking to probably get close to 30% by the -- by about Q4 this year. And then something I'm personally quite excited about is that we expect to be positive cash flow starting next month and then continue on into Q2 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Elon. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect Thank you.

"The asset-backed line, which really I think is -- was accurately regarded as a slight decrease in the gross margin of the car by about roughly 0.1% or thereabouts. Apart from that, we're positive cash flow. And then we're expecting to be profitable for 2016 on a non-GAAP basis. I think this is going to be really well received and then getting into production and delivery at the end of next year. And -- but then nonetheless, despite the lease accounting stuff, we anticipate being profitable by GAAP standards in Q4 of this year. We're really looking forward to the -- building the Model 3 on -- at theend of next month. And I think the chart on vehicle demand is a good one.",positive,0.7291673719882965
"Tesla does not advertise. We don't pay for any endorsements. We do not discount our cars for anyone, including me. Whereas those actions are -- all of our competitors take those actions. We also have far fewer sales outlets than our competitors. Essentially, there's a lot of degrees of freedom that we are not exercising that we could, in theory, exercise. In Switzerland, we outsold the Mercedes S-Class, the BMW 7 Series, Porsche Panamera and the Audi 8 combined. And in Germany, weOutsold the PorschePanamera. So I think these are pretty interesting. I pay full retail price. I think -- oh, and if you look at the text, it's worth noting that this is not just uniquely true in the United States.",neutral,0.5075217634439468
"I'm super excited to be here, as excited as I was on the first day I walked through the door. We had over $67 million in Model X ramp-up costs and nonrecurring items in the quarter, as Elon mentioned. Correcting for these items, automotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits, would have been 25%. Jason, do you want to add anything? Jason S. Wheeler Sure, absolutely. Thanks, Elon. First of all, I look forward to working with everybody. I think they make a difference in accelerating the advent of electric vehicles. And it's really important to appreciate that incentives are an accelerant.",positive,0.9488508105278015
"The place is moving really fast, and we took some time, Elon talked about this in Q2 on the earnings call during the shutdown, putting better systems in place to track this. We're moving to a place where we're tracking E&O on a real-time basis and bringing those facts to the table when we're making decisions. So we shouldn't be in this position again. And when you add back the leasing proceeds that we get of $209 million, it's a great step change in the right direction to getting us to net cash flow positive. Also CapEx, we guided to $500 million last quarter on the call. We closed out at $411 million for the quarter. That all resulted in ending cash balance being at $1.2 billion, which I think showcases our strong improvement in cash management and discipline.",positive,0.6411299407482147
"Brian Arthur Johnson with Barclays PLC. First, can you kind of just refresh us given the change from the revolver to the ABL? What's the available borrowing base? How much of that is, as you think about next year, going to be used to support increased on-balance sheet leasing versus increases in finished goods inventory? And what's your remaining, if the banks were to come in kind of borrowing base that would be left unpledged? Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial Officer Yes, sure. So on where we closed Q4 at, I think we were $135 million fully drawn on it. And then in terms of the borrowing base, there's a lot of detailed numbers behind that. I think the most important thing to point out here is the increase to $1 billion that we did with our banking partners. There are some restrictions there, and we don't want to max that out. So we're going to monitor it carefully and just make sure we get the production we need. we need to get full production with Model X. It's sort of the work in process on the X.",neutral,0.7798872292041779
Elon Musk: We actually started on that early and launched the campaign in the second half of 2015 to reach out to folks who had cars coming off lease. And one of the attractive things to those folks who were coming off a lease is have a car that's equipped with Autopilot. It's really exciting. And so we're finding that folks are willing to upgrade their Tesla as part of this campaign.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer.

"Elon Musk: I think the statement we made with the Model X, which I really think we've taken to heart at Tesla, is that we put too many new features and technologies, too many great things all at once into a product. In retrospect, it would have been a better decision to do fewer things with the first version of Model X and then roll in the capabilities and features and new technologies over time in subsequent years. So I do think that there were some issues with the Q4 launch, but we've learned from them and we're moving on to the next phase of the company's growth.",neutral,0.5394816398620605

The operation of the falcon door, the sourcing and supply of the large glass windscreen, are not a bottleneck at this point. Musk: I'd be surprised if -- if somebody buys the X, and particularly as the software gets refined, if it's not the product they love more than any product they've ever bought, I would be surprised.

Patrick, can you just tell us, what is the current run rate of X production, where we stand today towards the middle of February? And can we talk a little bit about how you get to that ramp? I mean, it sounds like 1,000 is the target that would obviously mathematically get you to think about half your production. So that's pretty much full ramp, but it seems like that's a pretty big distance from where you are now. That would be my first question. Elon R.

So there's some noise in the Q4 number, for sure, but I'm very confident in the projection and the forecast that we've given for 2016 relative to 2015. The next question comes from Dan Galves of Credit Suisse. Daniel Galves: Is it achievable to essentially keep the operating expenses pretty consistent throughout 2016? Jason S. Wheeler: Yes, we definitely believe that we can do that. The second question is about the 20% growth in 2016 versus 2015. It seems like that implies like relatively flat versus the Q fourth run rate. The third question is on the cost of goods sold.",neutral,0.5534074008464813

Tesla Fremont factory is currently #2, and if you're curious, #1 is a flower auction house in Washington. The Gigaf factory will be the largest footprint building in the world when it is done, Musk says. The Tesla Model 3 does not appear to be anywhere near the critical path for Model 3, he says. It's a big number in the absolute terms, but it is disproportionately small relative to incentives, let's say, Boeing would receive for keeping an aircraft factory in Washington, he adds. It is a big numbers, but I should say it does proportion -- it is aBig number, and I should says it is proportionate to the size of the factory.",neutral,0.5668118000030518
"I personally still prefer to drive the Model S over the X because I'm kind of a -- I like the lower position of a sedan. And the S, in terms of performance, is about 10% better in an acceleration or handling or whatnot than the X. So it really depends on optimization. If you like sort of a high seating position, like an amazing amount of room and functionality and just sort of the feeling of high visibility like -- I mean, because the -- one of the best features, maybe the best feature, of the X is the cockpit-style front windshield, which gives you this amazing panoramic view as you're driving.",positive,0.8158123195171356

Are you expecting them to be able to stay above 25% even with the Model X ramping? Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial Officer Sure. So as we said in the letter, 25% by the end of the year for Model X -- sorry, I'm a little under the weather -- and 30% for the rest of the company. Yes, yes, it makes sense.

Jason Wheeler: We're densifying in markets where we already exist. And where demand has increased significantly, we've got to put service centers. But you'll see service centers and retail locations opening across all of our markets, including Europe. Elon: We are opening new new markets this year. Jason: In addition, we're opening a significant number of stores in China and in the Northeast of the U.S. as we increase our awareness and our share in those markets.

This is something that we've talked about in the past. That is definitely backed up by our operations. Second factor on the cash position that we'd like to highlight is our continued CapEx discipline. about the Model 3, and it's giving us the ability to leverage that, included for cost-downs and also continue manufacturing efficiencies. As we mentioned in the shareholder letter, labor hours per car is trending quite positively right now and we're laser focused on continued improvement in that key metric.

We're actually very pleased with these results and we're comfortable that we aren't doing anything to adversely impact our future. On a go-forward basis, thinking about CapEx efficiency, you've heard Elon talk a lot about that machine that makes the machine. A big part of that is focusing on volumetric efficiency.

Could you maybe walk us between that number and what the actual change in deposits were? And in particular, where did Model 3preorders end the quarter at? Jason S. Wheeler Sure. In terms of thinking about the cash flow, yes, you're doing your math correctly, but we also release deposits when we deliver cars, so there's an inflow and there is an outflow there. And we had -- the deposits on the early Model X cars were larger than the later Model X car as well, so that's one of the impacts there as well. And in terms of the Model 3 reservations, the 373,000 number that you reference is what we talked about when we did when we spoke to you in April.

So if demand is up so much, why offer a lower-priced model and why hasn't production really been up that much more? Jonathan McNeill Sure. It's Jon, I'll give you a little bit of color on the demand which has been healthy for Model S in the second quarter and into the third quarter as well. But despite that, we didn't have cars in the European market with the new refresh until the last month of the quarter. We had some very healthy growth in the markets where we had cars in stores.

And a number of those reservation holders said to us we'd love to be in a Tesla today if you could provide a more affordable version of the Model S. And so we introduced the 60, and that's generated demand out of a new market segment. It is reaching down into that Model 3 reservation holder territory and portends really good things for future Model 3Demand. And then since since then, we've seen double-digit growth in both North America and China, really healthy growth inBoth of those markets. That growth has continued into the third quarter.

Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial Officer Yes, sure, so -- go ahead, Elon. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes.

I suspect we'll see a pretty decent number of people do that but we don't -- it's still very early. And if they do, do that, then it will push gross margins up into the 20s, like in the mid-20s or something. John Joseph Murphy BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay, that's helpful. And then just, Jason, maybe just 2 quick sort of housekeeping questions. CapEx, the $2.25 billion, you're running a run rate that's less than half that for the first half of the year.

The mix shift that we're seeing with more Xs being produced is one of the reasons. And now that we've talked a lot about just the production issues we've had, I think we're maybe a quarter or 2 off on that, but you're pointing to the right things. It's healthy and heading in the right direction, but they're obviously less than S. And our previous guidance had been approaching 25% for X and approaching 30% on S.

When we do direct leasing, then that drops us in to pure lease accounting so there, it will be that way on a GAAP and a non- GAAP basis.

And also in April, for most of April, the dollar was pretty strong. It's just trended in the last week or 10 days or so, and we were continuing to deliver cars. So that strong dollar impact does roll over sequentially into Q2 for us despite the lag effect of good news from a strong dollar. And as we said in the letter, we fully expect the mix impact to be offset by cost reductions that we will achieve. Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer Yes. And to your point, and maybe this is a broader comment to make, that as we look at our Q1 non- GAAP loss that we have of $45 million, a big chunk or most of it could be attributed to the dollar strength that has happened over the last 6 months.",neutral,0.5851147323846817

We're focused across every line item of our COGS, so material cost reductions, freight, both inbound and outbound. We continue with several engineering and promotional actions on material costs. It's a long list, not appropriate to go through. But yes, as a company, I think we are focused on Model X. But S is alsocertainly improving gross margin there, it's part of our priorities.

Does that change in any way that you're looking at partnerships and bringing partnerships in, and maybe an update on timing there? And then, Elon, you talked about having a fleet of a couple hundred X to get out and test. And you mentioned Model 3 showing it next March. When should we see the Model X in it's final version? Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer Well, no particular change to the partnership model for the GigAFactory. I think as Elon said, it's early days on trying to make some of those changes in direction. And it is continuing to go well.

Thanks to the incredible work of the Tesla team, Model 3 became the best-selling premium vehicle in the U.S. for 2018. Tesla achieved an 80% market share of U.s. sales in the last year. We also delivered -- also made vehicles last year as we did in all prior years combined. The -- if you track Tesla vehicle production year-over-year, cumulative sales deliveries year- over-year,. it is about the cleanest exponential I've ever seen. We've basically almost doubled our fleet every year. Every year, we make as many cars as we do in all previous years.

Over Q4, we achieved GAAP profitability for the second quarter for the first time in the company history. We increased our cash on hand by more than $700 million, even after paying debt, ending the year with a total of $3.7 billion of cash. This means we have enough cash to settle our convertible bond that will mature in March. And we expect that exponential to continue. So with the deliveries this year being -- even in the face of -- if there's a global recession, we're expecting Deliveries this year to be about 50% higher than last year. And this -- it could be a lot more than that.",positive,0.6759844720363617

Perhaps it could be a lot more than 50%, but I think 50% is a very reasonable number. But that's crazy growth for the automotiveindustry. One of our major priorities this quarter is improving service operations. That's #1.

We increased our Mobile Service fleet to 411 vehicles. And we're also increasing the functionality of the Tesla App for service, so that instead of having to make an appointment, to call and make a appointment, you can just open up an appointment. It's really seamless, invisible, the customers love it. We're working every aspect of that logistics chain. And I think we've -- I think it's going to be good. I'd say at this point, I'm optimistic.

The purchase of the land is a 50-year lease with the government of China. The plan is still to get funding for the majority of debt capital spending from local China banks. And we expect pretty attractive rates based on the dialogue we've had. And there's alot of interest. We hope to finalize that and then share the details at that point. And as Deepak was saying, we've been offered very competitive debt financing in China, really extremely compelling interest rates, so we do not expect that to be a capital drain on the company.

And although our fleets have a total -- Tesla fleet size has doubled in the past 12 months, which is again just kind of a crazy thing to consider that Tesla is almost doubling all cumulative production every year.

And this will continue in the future, if that trend continues. But it's really quite a difficult challenge to scale. It's like a total -- because service scales as not just with new production but as the total fleet scales, service needs to scale, and we want to scale service in a way that's sensible from a cost standpoint.",positive,0.7328602075576782

There's a number of things to consider here. The -- there's really 2 key dimensions for demand. There's value for money, and then there's affordability. Obviously, if somebody simply does not have enough money to buy the car, it doesn't matter how much the -- how good the value formoney is. You can have infinite value for. money, but if someone doesn't have the funds to buy a car, they simply can't get it. So it's really two key dimensions.

I think making our cars more affordable is also fundamentally part of the Tesla mission. So yes. Is there anything you want to add? Zachary Kirkhorn Chief Financial Officer Yes, I'll just add to that. I agree completely. What I'll add is that, generally speaking, within the Model 3 lineup, the pricing isn't too high or too low.

"The semiauto lines are where we have people there moving materials perhaps between the machines that are actually performing the operations. But there is still a degree of automation doing the operation. And this is what has been ramping quite effectively in the last -- in the first half -- the first part of this year. And it's pretty -- it's a small thing. So actually, I think it's probably worth providing some tours for investors that are interested, so you can actually see it first-hand. Elon R.

And when are you expecting the fully automated line to come on? Jeffrey B. Stauber: It's probably a level of granularity that is not productive to dive into in terms of exactly what is coming from which operation. But we do expect the new automated lines to be fully operational by the end of the year or early next year. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes, absolutely. I think you can really get a feel for what it is. Otherwise, it's just some words that are kind of hard to put -- hard to imagine.",neutral,0.6821289658546448
"The 1 million car target for 2020 was still there and that you would need to introduce the Model Y by then. We are going to make some capital investments towards the end of this year related to Model Y. I think we've got a good plan. It's really taking a lot of lessons learned from Model 3 and saying how do we design this thing to be easier to manufacture instead of how to manufacture, more difficult really. So I think it's going to be -- I really think it'll be a success, and I'm pretty excited about the -- how we're designing Model Y, which is going to take a little bit of time, but I'm really looking forward to it.

Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Perfect. And then just one quick follow-up. How should we think about the Tesla Semi and investments needed there?

"The next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David, on your autonomous vehicle strategy, why do you believe that your current hardware set of only camera plus radar is going to be able to get you to fully validated autonomous vehicle system? Most every competitor noted that they need the redundancy from LIDAR hardware given the robustness of the 3D point cloud and the data it's generated. What are they missing in their software stack and their algorithms that Tesla's able to obtain from just a cameraplus radar? Further, what would be your response if the. regulatory bodies require that level of redundancy and that's really needed from an incremental LIDar hardware? Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes. Well, first of all, I should say there's actually a 3-sensor systems test. There are cameras, redundant forward cameras and ultrasonics for near field.",neutral,0.749389261007309
"The road system is geared towards passive optical. We have to solve passive optical image recognition extremely well in order to be able to drive in any given environment and a changing environment. If you're going to pick active photon generator, doing so in 400 to 700-nanometer wavelength is pretty silly since you're getting that passively. You would want your active photon generation in the radar frequencies of approximately around 4 millimeters because that is occlusion penetrating. And you can essentially see through snow. it is for humans. It's just giving you -- in my view, it is a crutch that will drive companies to a local maximum, that we'll find very difficult to get out of. if you take the hard path of a sophisticated neural net that's capable of advanced image recognition, I think you'll achieve the goal maximum.",neutral,0.5805704295635223
"I find it quite puzzling that companies would choose to do an active photon system in the wrong wavelength. or rain, dust, fog, anything. They're going to get a whole bunch of expensive equipment, most of which makes the car sort of expensive, ugly and unnecessary, and I think they will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage. Now perhaps I am wrong, in which case I'll look like a fool. But I am quite certain that I'm not. David J. Tamberrino Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Okay. And as a follow-up, if I may, can we talk about the trajectory for the Model S and X margins? 3Q '17, I think the company was saying you're in the low 20% range. I think you took another step down per the report today, so I'm assuming it's probably at 20%. What's the path to recovery from here",negative,0.698447972536087

We can think of a huge number of ways to make it far better, far more efficient. I'm really excited about how much we're learning about manufacturing. That's why I said I think the long-term strength of Tesla will be the manufacturing plant, essentially productizing the Gigafactory, which is like the world's biggest product basically, like, make a nuclear aircraft carrier look like a car.

What will Gigafactory production be? And in the slightly more than $3,4 billion, is that also including the investments, Elon, that you mentioned on Model Y? So where exactly is this level of capital spending going to take us in 2018? And I have a follow-up, please. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni, your question is for Deepak Ahuja, Chief Financial Officer. Deepak, our biggest investment is obviously in the Model 3.

Model Y, I think, we might aim for something like maybe capacity of 1 million units a year, just for Model Y alone. And I think we'll be able to do that for CapEx that is less than the Model 3 CapEx at the $0.5 million. It's not a promise, but that's my gut feel on Model Y CapEx, Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer Right. So all of those pieces then add up to the total spend.",neutral,0.6211017072200775
"The $3.5 billion and the greater than 50% to Model 3, is that going to complete all the required equipment to get us to 10,000 a week at the end of the year? Or are we still going to have incremental capital expenditures? And then separately, on my second question around Model 3 gross margins, I think you had said that you expected them to be breakeven this quarter. Obviously, volume was lower, and so you didn't get there. But for next quarter, you're suggesting that they're going to be negative again. So can you help reconcile the apparent enthusiasm you have about the gross margin trajectory with the fact that your guidance around gross margins in the near term actually appears more cautious than it was guided at the time?

Philippe Jean Houchois Jefferies LLC, Research Division I have a slightly -- nonrelated to earnings about the electric truck, the Semi. In the past, Mr. Musk, you have spoken about supercapacitors as a way of generating energy and/or storing energy. And particularly in the application of heavy trucks, I would expect that the surge of energy in slowing down or braking in the truck would be too much for a battery to absorb. Are you considering supercapoties as an application for the Semi? Or what is your kind of general thought on that technology, and the implications to make that industrially viable? Yes. I'm a big fan of capacitors. I just don't think -- I think that the lithium ion chemistry is so good at this point that capacitors will not be needed.",neutral,0.6743721961975098

Could you maybe give us some more discussion really on the managerial culture, the process level, how you would benchmark yourself, for example, against the Toyota factory, which seems to be able to launch new product in about 3 or 4 months, to ramp up? Or at the other extreme, because I know Mr. Field came from there, kind of what Foxconn does in its goal to replace humans? But in particular, talk about the managerial processes, not so much the robots you're putting into place. Elon R.

John: Do you have enough experience with production of the Model 3 outside of the issues you're facing in the Gigafactory that you're confident once those problems are solved, you can get up and running? Or is there sort of a contingency here that once you get that worked out, you'll be ramping up in 3 months, and there might be some other hurdles that are discovered? I'm just trying to understand if there are some -- any incremental kinks that might come in the production process as you ramp up. And then also as we think about the step from 5,000 to 10,000, is that something that can be done inside the Fremont factory? But just curious on those 2 [ things ]. Elon R.

And I think we can get 10,000 vehicles a week out of Fremont without a significant -- without creating really any new buildings of significance in the existing space. We will need to bring up the south paint shop, which is what we actually were using for S and X paint, and so we upgraded north paint to do S, X and 3. But with relatively small CapEx, way less than we would otherwise have to spend to get to that level of production. It's a very exciting time for us.",positive,0.6754086166620255

So it'll be pretty easy to just have a tunnel, doing automated conveyance probably from seats to the factory. And there are, I mean, things we can do where we can build subsystems and then transport subsystems to Fremont. These things get increasingly difficult, but they're all doable.

In 2020, we expect to have 1 million robotaxis on the road. We believe we'll have the most profitable autonomous taxi on the market and perhaps the -- yes. Last quarter, we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North America experienced last quarter. We're the only company in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chip for fullSelf driving. And we're in a position unlike anyone else in the industry. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.",positive,0.7770438491347962
"Over half of our global deliveries occurred in the final 10 days of Q1. This was the most difficult logistics problem I've ever seen, and I've seen some tough ones. As a result, a large number of vehicles -- the vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2 which, of course, Q1 net income to be negatively impacted. In response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehicle booked throughout the quarter. This will make the -- this will put much less strain on Tesla, results in a much better delivery experience for customers and have a very positive effect on our working capital in the middle of the year.",negative,0.5437983721494675
"In Q1, Model 3 was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner-up by almost 60%. Since the introduction of Standard Range and Standard Range Plus, nearly 70% of trade-ins from Model 3 have actually been nonpremium vehicles. And in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever. And that'd be something similar in Switzerland as well. So these were really incredible achievements by the Tesla team. They were incredible. There were literally, to the best of my knowledge, 0 predictions that this would be the case. And we believe, over time, we'll be the best selling premium car throughout the world.",positive,0.9707623422145844
"U.S. never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because they want the Model 3 more than they ever wanted a vehicle, they're willing to pay more to get a Model 3. We're continuing to make significant improvements to our vehicle lineup, including updating the Model S and X production line to accommodate the next generation of powertrains. And we also introduced the loyalty program where if somebody has -- is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance Model S or X, they get the Ludicrous upgrade for free.

"We exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. This was a $1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending cash balance. The first is that we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1. $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows. The balance is more than explained by the working capital impact of expanding Model 3 operations overseas. And then we'll open it up to Q&A, around cash and profitability for the quarter. quarter. We launched the Standard Range lineup for Model 3, product retooling for Model S and Model X, and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and worked to do the corresponding impact that had on our order mix in deliverable cars.",neutral,0.575507640838623
"50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter. This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half and then U.S. local builds in the second half. This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEA and China and significantly stressed the delivery operations. Note, we also faced import issues in Shanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries towards the final couple of days and weeks. So we're addressing this by regionally on. And we expect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going forward. I'll also note that we're tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries for a month 1 in the history of the company.",neutral,0.7251570224761963
"We incurred $188 million of one-time adjustments that flowed through to net income. $120 million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced on February 28. There's an additional $67 million related to Q1 restructuring and other charges. Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue was negatively impacted by $501 million attributed to the reserve increase for S andX that I just noted. If you adjust for this, the decline from Q1 to Q2 would have been less than 1%. We expect significant cost savings to come from this. We've already executed on this for Model 3, and S and Z will be implemented in the next week or 2. The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter.",neutral,0.6511416733264923
"Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately 28 -- to 20%. This is due to 2 factors. One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February 28 as well as a mix shift towards the Standard Range lineup which we launched. We also successfully executed on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact. Labor content, warehousing and scrap, as examples, all had double- digit improvements from Q4 to Q1. North American ASPs are close to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being for long-range variants of Model 3. In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant.",neutral,0.629066526889801
"In energy as well, as we've noted previously, 2019 is a big year for storage, so a lot of exciting improvements coming there. And the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilize some of the assets that we've made investments in that. So just to conclude the opening remarks here, I've personally never felt more excited about the future of Tesla than I do right now, and that's a big part of the reason why I'm so excited about our product lineup. We're going to continue to build on our incredible base of knowledge and assets, which we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around the world.

You see -- based on what you saw in April, do you think that the 25,000 units per quarter is the level of demand that is where you see the market coming back already? Or are we not there yet? And more specifically, in the U.S., the pull forward in Q4 could hurt a lot of demand for S and X? Is that something that you still see in the numbers today in recent weeks? Or is that behind us? And I'll have a follow-up on Q2. Elon R. Musk Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect Yes. I mean, I think something like the -- returning to the 100,000 a year annualized demand is what we anticipate. That's to the best of my knowledge.

"Deliveries reached over 112,000 vehicles in a single quarter. At our Fremont factory, we're producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in its record year of 2006. This rate of production was [ cheap ] before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont. So there's a lot of potential to go beyond that number. For the Shanghai factory, I'd like to say that we expect to exceed that significantly this year. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon? Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director Thanks, Martin. So Q4 was another strong quarter for the company. It's hard to think of a similar product with such strong demand that it can generate more than $20 billion in revenue with 0 advertising spend.",positive,0.6336425244808197
"Tesla broke ground on the Model Y factory in Shanghai. I'm really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory. I think it's going to be an incredible asset to the company. We managed to achieve, by far, the highest energy efficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Y all-wheel drive got an EPA rating of 315 miles. This improvement is reflected on the configurator as of today. This is above what we've previously stated by a pretty significant margin. And then just with great acceleration, top speed, it's really just incredible specs all around. It was only 10 months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype.",positive,0.9656526446342468

I'd like to thank the whole Tesla team for their ongoing work on cost control. That's what has allowed us to get to these compelling financial numbers, while at the same time, growing company at an incredible pace. And in conclusion, when I think of what we have in front of us in the next couple of years, we've got Model Y, Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck, some very exciting improvements in battery technology.

"Tesla will produce approximately 1,000x more cars in 2020 than we produced in 2010. Over the course of the year, we've transitioned entirely from generating Model 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand. We've also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs, even increasing slightly in 2019. And we have also Solarglass and solar retrofit and Powerwall, Powerpack, all those other things, too.

With respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch of Model 3 in Fremont and Reno. And we are able to achieve positive GAAP net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled strong cash generation. We've also madeprogress on recurring software-based revenue with the implementation of premium connectivity and the beginning of upgrades available for purchase via the Tesla mobile app. Finally, on stock-based compensation, on Monday, we announced that we will not be paying any stock compensation in Q4 or Q1 of next year.

We expect to have completed the majority of planned supply chain localization at the factory or in the region. We are also seeing strong order rates for the locally built Model 3 and remain focused on continuing the production ramp and managing costs. We also anticipate significant progress on factory construction. As we look ahead to 2020, this, again, will be an important year for the company. Our task ahead is to execute on the next phase of growth while managing cash flows to support that growth.

"We are in the process of ramping 2 major products, Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, which I expect will temporarily weigh on our margins. We are also in the early stages of understanding if and to what extent we may be temporarily impacted by the coronavirus. Overall, we believe this will set us up for our strongest annual financial performance yet, with sufficient forecasted cash flows to support investments related to our growth and further strengthening of our balance sheet. For Q1, please keep in mind that the industry is always impacted by seasonality. We're expecting a 1- to 1.5-week delay in the ramp of Shanghai-built Model 3 due to a government-required factory shutdown. This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in theEarly stages.",neutral,0.6152878105640411
"The demand is very strong. We are working also not just through Tesla Solar Roof but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general. So it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do the installation. But over time, I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something to use Solarglass in one form or another. It's really going to be a choice of do you want a roof that is alive with power or dead without. And I think people will want a live roof that generates power and looks good and lasts a long time, and it's the future we want.",positive,0.5926312804222107

We're also working on the processes to continue to adjust our rates in California, which also have to go through regulatory processes as insurance is quite heavily regulated. There's a significant amount of innovation, as we've discussed before in this space, exactly getting to the intent of what the question here is, using our technology to reduce rates. And this will be rolled in over time. The last part of the question was, will there be a discount for using Autop Pilot with our cars? Elon R. Musk Founder, CEO & Director Oh, yes. Yes, there will be. to expand it to other locations.",neutral,0.6790827214717865
"The amount of money that people spend on car insurance is like a remarkably big percentage of the cost of a car. You can lease a Model 3 right now for $400 a month, but a typical owner in California will be paying sort of between $100 and $200 a month in insurance. So I think insurance is going to be, I think, quite a major product of Tesla over time. And a lot of that insurance cost is just because the insurance companies don't have good information about the drivers. And there's no good way to provide feedback, where it's a very poor feedback mechanism in terms of the insurance rates versus the actual way that the car is being driven.",negative,0.6927972733974457

But actually, what's really going on, it seems like that is just having the foundational software be very strong, have really strong foundation. And then a really fundamental thing is moving to video training. This is a really -- I mean, in terms of labeling efficiency, arguably like a 3 order of magnitude improvement in labeling efficiency. For those who know about this, it's extremely fundamental. So that's really great progress on that. Martin Viecha Senior Director for Investor Relations Thank you. And the last retail investor question comes from Kendall.

It seems like if people really looked at some of the smart retail investors, analysts and -- what some of them predicted about the future of Tesla, that would -- you'd probably get the highest accuracy and remarkable insight from some of those predictions.

Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs as well. And so if you add all of this up, our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the cost of Model 3 in China relative to Fremont. There's a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremont facility here in California and also the Model 3 factory in China.

Zachary Kirkhorn Chief Financial Officer No. for money, the answer is yes, immediately. I completely agree with that. I mean we have 2 products -- 2 vehicle products launching right now.

There are parts that we thought were right but then it turns out we've got -- they weren't right and then we send it back to the supplier. It's a -- basically, a production system is like a giant cybernetic collector. And then, it moves as fast as it can, which is very inefficient. So you end up having super high labor cost per car.

And making sure we're not adding extraneous features to the 3 that aren't necessary to achieve the production volume is also extremely important. I'm not going to -- at the risk of this being misinterpreted, and probably there will be some number of articles that do. But I think it's worth explaining sort of how manufacturing a manufacturing a Model 3 is very, very different from manufacturing a car.

The date is taken -- that has to be taken seriously, and they need to see some penalties for anyone, internally or externally, who does not meet that time frame.

"Deepak Ahuja: I think in plastics and paint, especially paint, we made modifications there on the existing paint shop. And I think there's also room for significant increases in our foundry in terms of casting. And we've also made a significant investment in stamping and some sort of advanced metal sheet forming technology that isn't stamping. Jeffrey B. Straubel: Maybe one thing maybe one thing is that we will do a further revision for the Model 3 and essentially go to third generation production technology for Model 3.

"Elon R. Musk: I think it's the first multiple choice I've gotten as a question. I would be super happy to see the whole industry go electric. And we have open-sourced our patent so those wouldn't be an impediment and but perhaps could be helpful. Jeff Evanson: Thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Good-bye. Elon Musk: Thanks,Jeff Evanson, we're happy to answer your questions. The last question in the queue is from George Galliers with Evercore ISI. George, how do you think about each electric vehicles from other OEMs? Do you view them as a scratch and competition [indiscernible] EV market?",positive,0.8107377290725708

"Our first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. I admire long-term thinking but impressive. So Elon, a question for you on Mars. Let's kick it off at Mars, okay? Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Really? Adam Michael Jonas Morgan Stanley, Research Division Yes. So just bear with me. I'm curious if you think this is accurate in spirit. And if launched, how could this potentially change your balance of time spent between Tesla and SpaceX? Could it potentially change the rationale of keeping Tesla, SpaceX as independent companies? And this is a serious question, Elon.",positive,0.6202782986968384
"I expect to remain with Tesla essentially forever unless somebody kicks me out. So that remains my intention. And I've been pursuing the sort of Mars thing at SpaceX and the same energy at Tesla for a long time simultaneously. So I think it's going through a pretty good rhythm. And yes, I'm -- I don't think I'm going to change my actions as a result of an initiative by the administration although I think a Mars initiative would be amazing and really energize the public domestically and would apply just as the Apollo mission to the moon that was half a century ago. Adam Michael Jonas Morgan Stanley, Research Division Just a follow-up on insurance. If your cars prove to be as much as 90% safer than other cars on a per mile basis, as I think you've alluded that -- it's a reasonable target medium term. If insurance companies only offer your customers, say, like a piddling 5% discount versus a comparably priced car, would you consider offering a service?",positive,0.5515612065375823
"We are building something in the order of 50,000 Model Ss per year. A lot of the big supplier, particularly the large sort of conglomerate suppliers, they just plug that number into their predictions but they ignore what we say. And then basically, the volume is either too small to count or the car cost is enormous because these fixedTESLA, INC. FQ4 2016 EARNINGS CALL FEB 22, 2017 costs must be allocated over such a small volume. David J. Tamberrino Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Yes, okay. From an actual line speed manufacturing perspective for the Model 3, what are you doing differently with the manufacturing process that is going to allow you to drive that ramp in production? So think about50,000 units, Model S, on an annual basis, it's good. It's great.",neutral,0.5538949372475891
"Elon Musk: In the future, the factory will be a more important product than the car itself. ""Our goal is to be the best manufacturer on earth. This is a real goal. I don't know if we'll succeed, but I think we're making good progress in that direction"" ""We have the Gigafactory, of course. That's a huge asset for factory, powertrain, power electronics, chargers and a few other things"" ""I've said this before but we're -- our goal is ... to be ... the best manufacturers on earth,"" he said. ""This is a very real goal."" ""We've made a lot of progress in the last 3, 4 years. the last three, four years""",positive,0.9232057631015778
"Elon Musk: I might just add that we really learned a lot of lessons, especially from the difficult Model X ramp. That's something that's in our recent memory, and we fought through it and succeeded. But I think in the design of the Model 3 and the system and the lines that produce it, many of those learnings have been incorporated from the beginning. So that has -- though painful, it was a very helpful experience for us to get ready for Model 3. Elon R. Musk: The rate of production is as fast as the slowest component in the vehicle. And when you have -- they call it an S curve. So the amount of operations involved some level of sort of assembly craft, where there's more judgment of the operator.",positive,0.6338914036750793
"Elon Musk: We had some challenges in the transition from Mobileye to Tesla software running on GPU. Mobileye did not -- refused to do that. So that forced us to reach in [ph] the board and caused unexpected delays, where we had to basically delete that chip from the board. Safety is always our primary concern. So we could have released Tesla in 1Q. But we wanted to make sure that we had the best Autopilot in the world, and we're happy to say that we have that in place for 1Q at this point in the year. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.",neutral,0.49660588800907135
"I think we want to just have an exhaustive testing process, a vetting [ph] process before enabling that throughout the fleet. So we've been edging our way up gradually now. Longitudinal control, [indiscernible] cruise control is at 80 miles an hour. And I think we should be able to get both to around the -- maybe 85 miles an Hour next month. But that's -- and then obviously, things will only improve from there. Ryan J. Brinkman JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Just last question on the $500 million cash generation outlook, including growth of nonrecourse debt. How much of that relates to the automotive operations versus SolarCity?",neutral,0.6769064962863922
"The next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph, I guess, relates to the delivery guidance which I know you limited to the first half. But as we think about the full year and the back half, is there the potential for disruption to S and X? Is that also one of the factors why you're sort of -- decided to sort of guide the way you did? Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder All right. Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial Officer Yes, sure. I think the way we're thinking about that is there's going to be pretty higher bars on -- with the deliveries only for Model 3 in the second half of the year. And I think Elon described that well when he talked about the S curve. So we didn't want to muddy our guidance by doing some kind of a combined number for the year and obviously, execution on X and S and execution on getting ready.",neutral,0.7608453928031006
"The next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Aileen Smith on for John. Are you anticipating any changes with respect to the oversight or regulations under CARB and its relationship to the EPA? Elon, is that coming up in your meetings with the Trump team at all or any of the discussions? And how would you respond in the event that regulations and standards or the potential to generate the credits were to be altered? Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Sure. Well, it's only come up briefly. And my response is that I think it will be fine to get rid of incentives and subsidies, but that should be uniformly applied to all industries.",neutral,0.8393003344535828
"If electric vehicle incentives went away tomorrow, Tesla's competitive position would improve. GM is able to sell the Volt at the price that they are able to do it while on paper, making a loss. Tesla's ZEV credits are worth only twice as much as they are for Tesla because they get the full retail value of their credits, which is worth about $10,000 more to them than it is to Tesla. The irony of getting rid of it would actually improve our competitive position, he said. But that's the only thing -- there was no -- that was my comment, but there's no response given.",neutral,0.49296337366104126
"The federal tax credit for electric vehicle caps out, I think, at 300,000 cars. So the ZEV, basically the credits either don't scale to high volume or they're disadvantageous to Tesla. Even in California, which is our home base, California legislature put an income cap on any one who could get the California tax credit. So I think is counterproductive to the biggest manufacturing player in California Why the hell the legislation? That, I do not know, but it was harmful to the state. Aileen Smith Okay, great. And then sort of a second question. Can you talk about the order growth for the Model 3? The last measurement that we received on the size of the wait list or the order book was 400,000 plus or minus.",negative,0.7202463150024414
"The only Model 3s will be like horribly negative margin, particularly on day 1. So it's just -- like no company on earth could -- there's no point for Tesla. It is like physically impossible. So you have to get the production rate to some reasonable capacity percentage of the system. If the capacity of the production system is X, until you're at least like half X, you're not going to be profitable. And our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin, can you give us some color on how we should think about margins in the second half of the year?",negative,0.7777028977870941
"We have to set these really strict dates. And some number of people are late, but it only has to be 1%. And then we'd either have to make those parts manually at great cost or slow down the production rate. If we make something manually as well, it's going to be a lot of work. It's just the way it goes. People are sometimes -- well, and I'm guilty of this, too, like, too optimistic about the timing or they get unlucky or something like that. Who can honestly say that they're going to get it all in time?",negative,0.747338056564331
"It sounds like CapEx is going to rise next year. How should we think about cash burn cadence and the confidence [indiscernible] no capital raise going forward? Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Well -- so this is really a question of what's the risk tolerance of the company or how close to the edge that we want to go. According to our financial plan, no capital needs to be raised for the Model 3. So we're considering a number of options, but I think it probably makes sense to raise capital to reduce risk. Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial Officer Colin, I just want to add a couple of points there, too.",neutral,0.6812409460544586
"SolarCity was actually a cash generator for the 5-week stub period. The way to think about SolarCity on a go-forward basis is prioritizing cash generations through preservation over the near term for that business. So I don't anticipate any significant -- it's not going to have a significant impact on our cash position in future quarters. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Arthur Johnson Barclays PLC, Research Division Just a few questions about the cash flow and cash CapEx and cash needs. First, I recognize that you're now consolidating in SolarCity. But if you were just to very roughly give us what the old automotive adjusted cash flow was. What would that roughly look like directionally? Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial Officer Sure.",neutral,0.760271281003952
"A couple of questions. Does that imply that that's not a full year 2017 number given that production cadence that you're planning? Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial Officer Correct. That's between now and the start of production for Model 3. Brian Arthur Johnson Barclays PLC, Research Division Okay. And second, can you talk a little bit more about the deferral of cash out for CapEx due to agreements with suppliers or some of those equipment suppliers to defer payments? Just what are those agreements? Where does that liability show up on the balance sheet? And then is that a hard -- as soon they deliver a proof part, does that come due? Or how does the actual timing of that payment work? Yes, sure,absolutely. So I think this is one of the benefits of having a very successful run over the last couple of years. We have developed a lot of trust with our suppliers. And we've been able to renegotiate the payment payment. So when I started, we asked, ""Okay, what's our average days payables outstanding?"" and it was lower than it should be.",neutral,0.7382240295410156
"Tesla will have as many more ZEV credits than the rest of the U.S. industry combined. James Joseph Albertine: California maybe should do a bit more to support its only remaining auto manufacturer to remain competitive. ""It's -- this mandate becomes irrelevant at scale,"" Albertine says. ""They're just not as important at scale because the mandate are too weak,"" he adds. ""I was just sort of getting at the fact that maybe if the Volt sale went well, maybe if we could get some of these credits back, it would be a good thing,"" he says. 'We're making 20x, 30x that number,' Albertine adds.",neutral,0.6476911605441589
"The next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer. Colin, can you talk about timing for full ramp on both anode and cathode assembly? And then I have a follow-up question on the debt that you drew down in the fourth quarter. Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder They're very big modules. Jeffrey B. Straubel Chief Technology Officer Yes, they're pretty large increments, but those will be up and running at full capacity for the first instances within just a few months. We're already in the stages of -- or beginning the second instance of anodes and cathodes.",neutral,0.7639868853063354

"The next question comes from the line of Tyler Frank with Robert Baird. Tyler Charles Frank Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Elon, I guess this is for you. Taking a step back, looking at the bigger picture, you previously talked about producing 1 million units per year by 2020, and that's 500,000 units in 2018. How confident are you now in both of those targets? And is there anything that need to be done from the battery perspective side in order to reach those goals? Would you need to build another Gigafactory prior to hitting 1 million per year in 2020? Or do you think that the current gigafactory will have enough capacity? Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder Yes. Tyler Frank: Could you give us an idea of how much battery capacity you think you have? Elon Musk: If you say it's somewhere around the 60 to 70 kilowatt hour level, then you need 70 gigawatt hours to get to 1 million. And we think -- at the cell level. And then we think the kind of Gigaf factory should actually be able to do in excess of 100 gigawwatt hours.",neutral,0.7447141706943512
"Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners. Rob, I just wondered if I could ask little more about the CapEx. I know you're talking about sort of CapEx up until Model 3. But can you give us any kind of breakout for -- maybe for if you just did it in percentage terms looking throughout the year, how much CapEx you're thinking for Model 3 versus Gigafactory and versus Solar? Jason S. Wheeler Former Chief Financial Officer Sure. We don't break down and we don't disclose the specifics here, but obviously, Gigaf factory and Model 3 are going to be the biggest investments.",neutral,0.7366662919521332

There is some sort of -- some fairly. obscure sounding dyes, like the -- like one dye for, like, seat frame that -- it's currently. a long lead item. But since we know about it, we're attacking it, and that's unlikely to be a scheduled driver. Things that are likely to be schedule issues are things that we actually just don't know about today. But it will all be here and it will be a hive of activity. And I'll be personally down there, looking at the line, as I was when we put the Model S line.",neutral,0.6227501481771469
"The first thing we will try to increase our output is to increase exit last year with the line, and we don't know exactly where the 2 points are going to be. We try to model it out as carefully as possible, but there'll be things that aren't captured in the model and -- but I think in a lot of cases, we'll simply be able to run the lines faster as opposed to duplicate the line. That's like, by far, the best CapEx maneuver, is just to make it go faster but -- I would say it's going from 5,000 to 10,000 is probably -- it's a total wild ass guess.",neutral,0.6217871308326721
"I can't imagine it being more than about 70% as much as the original. It's to go from 5,000 to 10,000. again, which obviously is pretty awesome from a CapEx standpoint. But where there were great efficiencies in the way to lay out a facility, for instance, that there were at Gigafactory. So -- and there, we don't anticipate needing to build much new square footage, so that's a good thing. And J.B., what do you think? Jeffrey B.

We have a real volumetric problem, a good constraint to have. So parking is, like, one of my biggest nightmares, like where do we park everyone? And it's like -- Elon R.

Some of our manufacturing areas, we're actually seeing capabilities that are, we estimate, in the 6,000 to 7,000 unit per week capability. So -- and we're optimistic with further progress. This is a relatively small shift. The Model 3 is a 10-year program, and so we're talking about a few months out of a 10,year program that's, in a grand scheme of things, as certainly if one is doing net present value calculations, this is immaterial.

On the plus side, we now have a very detailed understanding of what is necessary to fix zone 1 and zone 2. We also have a new design for zone 1, and we've allocated many of our best engineers to fundamentally fixing zone 2 and then most problem behind that it is zone 1.

How does this change the trajectory -- or does it changed the trajectory from a margin perspective on the Model 3? And then maybe as an aside, can you tell us where you are today on a production-per-week basis and where you expect to be by the end of 2017, just so we can get an idea of the ramp? Elon R. Musk CEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-Founder I don't really like the week-by-week stuff. But the thing -- the reason it's tricky is because people just read too much into it. The ramp curve is a step exponential. So it means like as you alleviate a constraint, the production jumps -- suddenly jumps at a much higher number. And then so although it looks a little staggered, if you sort of zoom out, that production ramp is an exponential with giant week-over-week increases.",neutral,0.4880420417014847

With Model 3, it's like -- tends to be either the machine works or it doesn't or it's lumping along and we get short quite severely on output.

Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer Well, firstly, as we continue to ramp up Model 3,. Our cash flow of operations is going to increase or improve significantly over the next few quarters. And it's -- this is the positive virtuous cycle of working capital that Model 3 provides us, because we effectively pay our suppliers later when we collect from our suppliers. John Murphy, Bof a Merrill Lynch,.

"Elon Musk: If you extrapolate from 5,000 units towards the end of Q1, we do want to hold off on giving CapEx until we are confident. So it's a bit too early to make the exact number. But I think, if you extrapolate from 5,.000 units towards theend ofQ1, I think you'd do over 325,000 vehicles. But what now would be a reasonable expectation based upon what you know for the Model 3s that do get built in 2018? That's what we're looking at. We're not going to give an exact number, but it would be in the range of 250,000 to 300,000. That's the range that we're talking about. That would be based on what we know right now. And that's the number that we are looking at right now, which is the range we're aiming for in 2018. We don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves. We want to make sure we're on the right track.",neutral,0.7948625087738037
"The goal is right now to fix the bottlenecks. It's our fault for picking the wrong supplier and then not realizing it until way later in the game. We will be able to call back some amounts, but it certainly will not make up for the lost revenue, the lost free cash flow. So some amount, yes, But it's not going to matter that much. The goal isright now tofix the bottleneck. It is our fault and my problem, most of all. If we picked the wrong subcontractor, we're the fault. So just -- I don't want us to be -- sort of us externalizing responsibility. Really, it's our responsibility. We're not trying to blame anyone else. We just want to get it fixed as soon as possible.

"The next question comes from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Rod Avraham Lache Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Just had a question about how we should be thinking about capital spending maybe at a high level next year. It sounds like you're going to be deploying some capital to increase to 10,000 units per week. And obviously, there've also been some reports about you investing in another assembly facility in China. So is your CapEx still expected to be lower in 2018 versus 2017? Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer So Rod, in terms of the China factory, I'll leave for Elon to make comments on that. But I think maybe better if we hold on, broadly speaking, to that question to the next quarter when we provide full 2018 guidance and give you better clarity on our capital spend for the different elements in our plan. I suspect it's comparable and similar to 2017. We have some -- obviously some -- it's somewhat of a strategic choice. Do we have higher CapEx and higher growth or lowerCapEx and lower growth? Yes.

But -- in respect to China, I wouldn't expect any significant CapEx on China until 2019. It won't be material in 2018. We'd far rather accelerate production line than duplicate it.

Is that a concern that you might run out of cash and have to raise more cash? What's at the root of that decision? And why isn't the -- why is there even a decision, I guess, is the question? Deepak Ahuja Chief Financial Officer I mean, I would say it's probably a bit of all.

"This was an incredibly historic quarter for Tesla. Model 3 became the best-selling car in the U.S. in terms of revenue. We saw higher revenues and significantly better profitability in our energy business. I think with solar, it may have been the best quarter ever for solar. We achieved GAAP net income of over $300 million, increased cash and increased cash. We're going to talk about vehicle safety, Autopilot and factory safety. And we have a number of people from Tesla here to elaborate on that. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks.",positive,0.9316622018814087
"We expect to again have positive net income and cash flow in Q4. I think we can actually be positive cash flow and profitable for all quarters going forward, leaving aside the quarters where we may need to do a significant repayment. I especially want to thank customers who helped -- it's like I've never even heard of this -- maybe this has happened before, but I'm never heard of a case where a company's customers actually cared about the future of the company so much that they volunteered their time. This quarter was made possible by the incredible execution of our employees across the board, from sales, production, delivery, service, energy, engineering, finance and all of our G&A teams. Really every part of the business executed incredibly well.",positive,0.9054537415504456
"This quarter, we started rolling out Version 9 of our software, which is the biggest software upgrade in 3 years. And Model 3 received a 5-star safety rating in every category and subcategory. I think that's the lowest probability of injury of any car that the U.S. government's ever tested. Looking ahead, we expect to produce and sell even more Model 3s in Q4 and expect that trend to continue into Q1. We're excited to bring Model 3 to Europe and China early next year given that the market for midsized premium sedans in those regions is even larger than in North America. I said before that we must prove that Tesla can be sustainably profitable. This quarter was an important step towards that, and I'm incredibly excited about what lies ahead.",positive,0.919434517621994

It's not just for electrical vehicle. Any vehicle, period. And that fundamentally differentiates us, so -- which essentially helps us to keep adding new features and new safety technology,"" he said. ""That's very important and that shows in Model 3. Just the things that we have"" ""We anti-game the system. So the actual safety is not fully captured in the tests because we anti- game the system,"" he added.

"The fact that the hood can condense so far in is really helpful because it ends up being like a sort of -- sort of like a trampoline or like -- it has -- you just -- you don't have a rock underneath this. That's very helpful. So it's helpful for pedestrian safety and for the safety of people in the car. And then even if you have like a head-on collision with another car, the extended sort of crumple zone of a Tesla Model S, X or 3 is helpful to the people in it and the other car. If the car were to hit a pedestrian, we'll get to active safety next because the best thing is actually not just to hit car or a pedestrian.

Initially, it will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn signal before the car moves into an adjacent lane. Future versions will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement if they choose to. With the advancement in neural networks covering 360 degrees of view around our car, we can provide a level of constant vigilance that humans just can't. Ultimately, this should allow us to warn, even intervene, for an enormous percentage of modern accidents.",neutral,0.7298167049121247

Despite being about the -- it costs about the same, cost volume, and product consumption are approximately the same as the currentHardware. But it's a tenfold improvements in frames per second. And improved redundancy as well. But very importantly, very important to emphasize is that the only -- the thing that needs to change between the cars produced today and the cars that are produced in the second quarter of next year is swapping out the Autopilot computer.",positive,0.7532773019215546
"There's no advantage to ordering now versus Q2. But anyone who asks for it can certainly get it. There's definitely no need to wait until Q2 to order a car. It's -- we want to make it just a completely seamless process. The team is incredibly excited about the upcoming upgrade for the Autopilot computer. This upgrade allows us to not just run the current neural networks faster. But more importantly, it will allow us to deploy much larger, computationally more expensive networks to the fleet. The reason this is important is that it is a common finding in the industry, and that we see this as well, is that as Tesla. took that off.",positive,0.7410410344600677

And any customer will be able to share their car at will, just like you share your house in Airbnb. So it's a combination of those 2 models. I think it's pretty obvious where things are headed long term. And then, Laurie, can you finish off with -- let's talk about factory safety. And thanks for the hard work of you and your team. And yes, please, please go ahead. Laurie Shelby VP, Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Yes, thanks. We have the safest cars made by the safest people.

And then on -- as a quick follow-up, you've announced over the weekend like a mid- range car with smaller battery packs. So how did you decide the sequencing of these 2 things? Why is it lower car now and going abroad in Q4? Elon R. Musk: Our expectation was we would do better but we wanted to be conservative, you're right, in terms of our guidance that we gave for Q3. Yes. Pierre C.-Ferragu: That's great. And I was wondering, as you're looking at expanding, for example, the Model 3, I think about it as you had 2 options. One was to go -- grow and to keep what you're seeing at higher-end, higher-ASP car. And the other one was to going for a lower-cost car and stick to the U.S.",neutral,0.6731627285480499

So like suddenly there's a sense of like mass-market premium. And the price walk is way beyond the federal tax credit. So clearly, there is value to the car that they are perceiving, whether it's cost of ownership, or sustainability, or the brand or the product itself. It's just a lot of people upgrading their cars quite dramatically. This is a huge upgrade.

This is a giant improvement in the capital efficiency of the company because we're making on the order of $75 million worth of products per day -- of cars per day. So every day, it requires $75,000 -- $75million worth of capital. So this is really like tightening that and getting that below 10 days in North America and then also improving dramatically the time -- the transit time to. reduced it to around 20 days.

Wheeler: There was definitely an increase in payables and I think that will start to unwind a little bit in Q4, although this is natural. If you look at production, I believe it increased 37% quarter-over-quarter so there's naturally going to be more parts coming into the factory.

There's like -- if somebody's just installed a roof and if the house is also a roof, that's a different story. But we do think it's important to have tight control over the production of the solar panels in order to have a beautiful solar Roof product.
