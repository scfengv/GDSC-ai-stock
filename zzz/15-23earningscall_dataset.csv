2015/5/6,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Tesla Motors FirstQuarter 2015 Financial Results Q&A Conference Call.  As a reminder, today'sconference is being recorded. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Evanson. Sir, the floor isyours.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsThank you, Huey, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's first quarter Q&A webcast. I'm joinedtoday by Elon Musk, Tesla Chairman and CEO; J.B. Straubel, our CTO; and Deepak Ahuja, Tesla's CFO.We announced our financial and operational results today in a shareholder letter that is available at thesame link as this webcast. And a replay of the webcast will be available later today at the same link.The shareholder letter includes GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, as well as reconciliations betweenthe 2. Our non-GAAP measures add back deferred revenue and related expenses for cars delivered wherecash has been or will very soon be collected. These non-GAAP results also exclude stock-based compand noncash interest expense. Revenues and costs associated with cars leased directly through Tesla aretreated the same in our GAAP and non-GAAP financial information.And during our call, we will be discussing our business outlook and making other forward-lookingstatements, which are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or resultscould differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent Form 10-K filed with the SEC.And now, Huey, if we could you please have the first question.","Elon Musk, Tesla Chairman and CEO; J.B.

2015/5/6,"And yes, so I'm feeling pretty goodabout things. But because that production ramp just scales exponentially, depending upon where thatexponential curve falls across a quarterly boundary, it can actually make quite significant -- make quitea significant effect on the production and deliveries in that quarter. So that's why it's like -- it's easy --it's a lot easier to predict it sort of continuous than if it's discrete with offshore [ph] quarterly cut-offs.But I really think the X is going to be -- it's really going to be a great car. I just drove the latest prototypetoday, and it's like, wow, this is by far the best SUV.","The production ramp just scales exponentially, depending upon where thatexponential curve falls across a quarterly boundary.

2015/5/6,"Next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.John LovalloBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionFirst question is, do you guys earn 4 or 9 ZEV credits per vehicle? And how many vehicles are participatingin your battery swap beta program?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThe amount of credits, ZEV credits, we earn depends on the size of the pack, different for what we'redoing for the 60 versus 85, and now the new ones at 70. That has been varying over time, the amount ofZEV credits we earn. So I'll need to confirm that before I give the official number here.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectThe ZEV credits thing, it's not like -- I mean, it sort of moves things by like 2%. It's like not supermaterial. So I'm not sure what the point of your question is.John LovalloBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionWell, yes, here's the point of the question is that assuming you guys sell 10,000 vehicles in ZEV states thisyear, that would mean that you would need 400 programs -- sorry, 400 vehicles involved in this batteryswap program if you assume that each of them swapped 25x each, so a minimum of 400 vehicles. So I'mcurious if there are 400 vehicles involved in the battery swap program.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, I mean, you do realize like ZEV credits don't sell for 100 cents on the dollar. They sell for like $0.50or sometimes less. And there are not always customers for the ZEV credits.John LovalloBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionYes, I'm just asking about what you guys are actually earning per vehicle. Okay, and I guess the next...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectIt's not a big deal, yes. And as more of our production goes overseas, obviously, there's no ZEV statesoverseas. And as our sales increase outside of California or Canada, those are not ZEV states. So this islike -- the ZEV stuff is like an increasingly small part of the picture over time.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWe have hundreds vehicles in the battery swap pilot program.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerIt's not like 10 or something like that. It's hundreds of vehicles.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. We've steadily increased the invitation list. We've just found like it's -- there just is not a lot ofinterest in people doing pack swap.","The amount of credits, ZEV credits, we earn depends on the size of the pack, different for what we'redoing for the 60 versus 85, and now the new ones at 70.

2015/5/6,"So if somebody wants to do a daily cycling basically gooff grid. It's going to be more expensive than being on grid. This doesn't mean that people won't buy itbecause there are people who want to go off grid on principle, or they just want to be independent. Andthat's what the SolarCity comment is about.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerIt might also be worth noting that SolarCity doesn't yet operate in Europe. the main target applicationfor the daily cycling battery pack was actually -- were several markets not in the continental U.S. Andparticularly, Germany and Australia are very strong markets where it does make economic sense todaybased on the feed-in tariff and the electricity rate structures in those countries. So SolarCity's comments, Ithink, need to be put in the regional context.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. SolarCity is only operating in the U.S. And the power wall, it will be available from SolarCity and fromother installers in both configurations. But if someone is doing a daily cycling application, they're doing itout of -- because they specifically want grid independence. And there's some number of people who willwant to do that, and that's good. And it's also important to appreciate like even to say the power backupsystems, so that you always have power in the event of a power outage, if -- like let's say that appealsto like 2% of households in the U.S. or 1%. Let's say 1%, that's 1 million households. Like is there oneperson in 100 care about having battery backup in the event of utility outage? Probably. We couldn't evensupport a small fraction of that, so -- right now, so it's kind of a moot point.","SolarCity's comments, Ithink, need to be put in the regional context.

2015/5/6,"Our next question comes from Andrea James with Dougherty and Company.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionJust to build on the Tesla Energy conversation, what are your revenue and gross margin targets on thatbusiness? And how do we look at the 2015 ramp?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, I mean, the gross margin revenue obviously is going to change with time. So when it's low volumemade in Fremont, it will be relatively low margin. Once we get to Gigafactory up and running and -- highvolume and get the economies of scale working, this is just a guess right now, but I mean like maybe it'ssomewhere around 20%. It's not like -- it's like we just don't have enough information to say exactly thatwould be, but probably 20% is a reasonable guess. And then in terms of volume, I mean, we're going totry to scale it as fast as we can -- as the slowest manufacturing constraint. So I mean, it's easier to saywhat's the long term without saying like exactly which quarters it's going to be, and I don't know. But Ithink we'll see demand for stationary storage as measured in sort of megawatt hours or gigawatts hoursto be approximately double that of the car. That's our best guess for long-term demand yet.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionHow do you think about your capacity or even your cost per kilowatt hour? Because it's different than acar, right? The duty load is way different for a stationary storage application. So can you educate us a littlebit on how we look at analyzing that business and the difference between that and the energy needs ofthe car business per pack?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, there's 2 applications which are quite different. One is backup power or peaker -- sort of theequivalent -- on a utility scale of like a peaker plant, which is a high-energy application. And then there'sthe daily cycler application. There are different chemistries depending upon which one you have. So thebackup power chemistry is quite similar to the car, which is like a nickel cobalt aluminum cathode. Thedaily cycling control [ph] constituent is nickel manganese cobalt, so there's quite a lot of manganesein there. And there's just one's meant for, call it maybe 60 or 70 cycles per year. And the other one ismeant for daily cycling -- daily deep cycling, so it's 365 cycles a year.","Elon R.

2015/5/6,"The power wall is great, but it'sprobably only 10% to 20% the size of the power pack demand.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerMaybe one point on the cost structure. There's definitely a lot of commonality in the supply chain and evenin the manufacturing base on how we do the modules themselves for the Tesla Energy products, alongwith the vehicle products. So as we ramp up production on the Tesla Energy products, there definitely arebenefits to the vehicle costs of energy storage from scale and from just generally moving more materialand kilowatt hours through that whole chain. So both businesses benefit each other.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. I mean, clearly given the very high demand that we're seeing for Tesla Energy products, we'reactually trying to figure out if we can go from like our current production target of like 35 gigawatthours at cell level and 50 at the pack level in our Nevada plant to maybe 50% more than that or evenhigher because just the sheer volume of demand here is just staggering. We could easily have the entireGigafactory just do stationary storage.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionRight. So you have some capacity. I think you said maybe 15% of your capacity might be reserved forstationary storage. Maybe I've read that in an article somewhere, I'm not sure.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product Architect15 gigawatt hours or 1/3 of the 50 gigawatts hours that's targeted at the pack level, so 15% at the 15gigawatt hours or roughly 30%.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionOkay. And you might add now maybe -- you're looking at doing another 50%, In growing the capacity50%, and you have the space, I guess there in Nevada to do that?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWe do. I don't want to make that a prediction. But that seems like the thing that we should do, so we'reinvestigating that. It seems like the logical thing to do, so we're going to probably try to do that, yes.Because we're fairly confident at this point, that the entire Gigafactory output could just do stationarystorage. It's like wow, okay, we need to make cars, too. So we should try to make the factory bigger.That's like the total logic. It's not more complicated than that.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionBut given the choice between making -- sorry, but given the choice between making a pack for a car andmaking a pack for a stationary storage application, how do you pick which one gets the priority?Elon R.","Elon R.

2015/5/6,"StraubelChief Technology OfficerIf anything, it's quite over-engineered for a battery pack that doesn't have to move. It gets mounted onyour wall. So I think that's going to be a great benefit for reliability and just longevity of the pack.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsAnd one for Deepak. Would you be willing to provide any breakdown of the capital -- the CapEx spendingin Q1?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThe CapEx spending was primarily driven by the capacity expansion that we're doing for Model X,including the tooling spend. And then, of course, we are putting in the new paint shop, which is a verysignificant investment. That will be ready in Q3. And then we have also had investments in the Gigafactoryand our sales and service network. That's probably the order in which we've been spending.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsGreat. Thank you.","If anything, it's quite over-engineered for a battery pack that doesn't have to move. It gets mounted onyour wall.

2015/5/6,"Next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionI guess first question is staying on the stationary storage topic. I mean, how do you view the -- youmentioned there's 2 different chemistries. How does that work with the Gigafactory? Does that require allseparate lines? Is there any more complexities or all within the same facility? And how do you view yourchemistries versus other competitive options out there? There are other people who are bullish on thingslike zinc and other more basic chemistry?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, they could still be both be built in the Gigafactory. It doesn't -- we have multiple lines operating inthe Gigafactory, so if one line is building nickel cobalt aluminum chemistry and another is building nickelmanganese cobalt, that still works just fine. A lot of the cell assembly and then the processes that happenafter that are almost identical.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I mean, they look the same at the module and pack level. You can't really tell by just looking at them.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectIt's just kind of the internal chemical constituents. I mean you can think of like the -- sort of breakdownthe problem like -- the cell is a chemical engineering problem. It's like a little can of chemicals. And thenthe module and pack problem is a mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineeringproblem. And if you have just like a small number of cells, then as an overall engineering problem, it'slike mostly about the cell. But once you get -- have a lot of cells, then it's -- then the intellectual propertychallenge, the intellectual challenge becomes more at the mechanical, electrical and software level, whichis where Tesla does quite well. That's why you don't really see -- like nobody else has like -- has a packlike ours. There -- the cells are relatively generic, but the module and pack is not.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. And we've looked at pretty much every chemistry couple that could possibly be relevant for this.We're confident what we're using is going to be the best. But if there's something better, we can alsoadjust and change over time. So there's a lot of flexibility.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I mean I'm not sure if like the exact -- the right analogy would be, but like if you had like a laptopand it's like you could say, ""Whoa, a laptop's really just like Intel CPU and some Micron DRAM chips."" Like,big deal.","Elon R. Musk: We've looked at pretty much every chemistry couple that could possibly be relevant for this. We're confident what we're using is going to be the best.

2015/5/6,"Next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionA couple questions on stationary storage first. One is it seems like utilities move quite a bit slower thanother markets. So I was wondering when you are thinking about the expectations for the trajectory ofgrowth, if you had the capacity today, how long would do you think it would take for you to get to that15 gigawatt hours? Also related to this business, it seems like you're using third parties for most of thedistribution, installation. So if you achieved maybe a 20% gross margin, can you pass along any thoughtson how we should we be thinking in terms of SG&A is allocated?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI think it's pretty early days to -- I mean, we're being super-speculative at this point. So it's...Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. Maybe one point on the distributors. We're only focusing on that approach for power wall in most case-- in most cases. So with utilities, we're building those relationships directly. That's not something thatis really effective to go through a distribution channel, and it's something we have also been doing for anumber of years. It didn't just start last Thursday. And we've built these relationships partially throughvehicle infrastructure and charging questions and back and forth, supercharging as well. So there'sactually quite a lot of trust built between Tesla and many of the utility companies, which is very helpful togrow that business faster.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionAnd just a clarification on the comment about the fact that a DC/AC inverter is already there for solar.Does the fact that it needs be bidirectional change the nature of the cost? Or not really?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerNo, not in most cases because if you have already solar, typically, the energy to charge the battery cancome from the solar panel. So I think maybe one way to think of it is, if the battery pack, the power wall,with its internal DC to DC converter, can act much like a solar panel. It can match voltage with the solarpanel array and it can feed power back into that. So the existing inverter doesn't particularly see a bigchange.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay, got it. On the auto business, do you have any preliminary expectations on the mix of the 70Dversus 85? Any thoughts on how that affects margins? And lastly, a question for Deepak.","If you had the capacity today, how long would do you think it would take for you to get to that15 gigawatt hours?

2015/5/6,"In the past,we were able to look at your supplemental information on leasing where you disclose the value of theleases delivered and the value that you're booking this at on the balance sheet, which is presumably yourcost. And it sort of approximated your gross margins, but this quarter, when you do the math, the impliedmargins were something like 44%, not like 29%, 30%. Is there something unusual there?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerI'll answer the second one. No, there's nothing unusual in those numbers as the overall. What you'reseeing in the supplemental information is the new cars we've delivered. What's coming through ultimatelyis the cumulative impact of all the leasing that we have done. But to my knowledge, there's nothing elseunusual.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. It seems like a pretty high margin, though, when you look at it that way. Anything on the mix, 70Dversus 85?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI mean, it's still pretty early to be predicting mix because you have to distinguish between what's sort ofinitial demand versus sustained demand. So I mean, it looks like there may be -- going to be comparablenumber of 70s versus 85s. But it's -- this is difficult to -- this is extrapolating on very little information.And yes, I think a key point I should make before this call ends is we're really optimizing, at this pointgoing forward, we're going to be optimizing for the operational efficiency of the company as opposed tospecific quarters. This is -- I feel like what we've done in the past, where we've really had to scramble atthe end of quarters and sometimes have not a great customer experience at the end of quarters. It's notreally the right thing for the company. And so we're going to be operating more for sort of steady-stateefficiency. And that means the quarterly fluctuations could be a little higher, but in the long term, it will bebetter. So that's an important consideration. Also sort of unlike other car companies, Tesla sales are onlyrecognized when they arrive at the end customer and we've received payment and all the regulatory docshave been processed and all that. So our sales are always kind of true -- they're always true sales. They'renot sales to the channel. Whereas the other car companies are -- they're sales to the channel. So it'spossible to sort of -- for them to make numbers work, where they're selling to their channel as opposed toend customers.","In the past,we were able to look at your supplemental information on leasing where you disclose the value of theleases delivered and the value that you're booking this at on the balance sheet.

2015/5/6,"StraubelChief Technology OfficerSome of the different revenue streams you're talking about are kind of mixed between power pack andpower wall. The BMS system lives inside the battery pack in both cases. But with the power pack, inthe more utility-sized installations, there, we often will have sort of a site master computer or mastercontroller that controls multiple power packs. And that site controller is what then interfaces to theutility or maybe a commercial customer to sort of run the scheduled charge and discharge that wouldbe appropriate for a given application. On the power wall, it's a bit of a different situation. Still, the BMSlives inside the battery pack. But in some cases, the inverter may be the system that's deciding how tomanage energy in the overall house, and that can depend on which type of inverter we're using and howthat works. And in terms of the size, we really -- for power wall again, we optimized the size around whatwas the most common photovoltaic size and also what we felt was kind of the smallest modular incrementfor backup. And it's pretty key to note here that you can install multiple power walls together. So having10 kilowatt hours doesn't mean that you can't very easily put in 20 or 30 or 40. And in many cases, Ithink people will, to have the backup kind of matching that they want to see. But we felt 10 kilowatt hourswas the lowest kind of common element. And if you go smaller than that, you start to run into worseeconomies of scale and more the system that's not related to storage.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsHuey, before we go to the next question, I just wanted to give everybody a status update. A lot ofimportant things to talk about on this call, but we-are 50 minutes into the call and we still have 7 callers inqueue.

2015/5/6,"Our next phone question will come from Brian Johnson with Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionJust really want to ask about the balance between stationary and automotive. It's not unusual for growthcompanies to change their focus as they evolve. I think at least one of the stories around PayPal, itwas going to be a cryptographic PDA-focused company, until it refocused perhaps through your help,Elon, on web-based payments. It just -- I'm hearing you talk about stationary storage as being able toramp faster perhaps, although you didn't [ph] answer this kind of maybe with a lower CapEx and OpExratio than the auto business. Yet at the same time, auto takes a lot of capital, takes a lot of OpEx. AndSergio Marchionne pointed out there's a lot of value-destroying capital spent in the legacy industry. Is itconceivable that instead of say being 70/30 auto/batteries, it could go the other way?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectIt's possible. I mean, this is -- we're, like, really super in guesswork territory here. All we know rightnow is like we have demand, like, well in excess of our production ramp. So we know like, right now, Ithink we should work on is trying to increase our production ramp, not trying to increase demand. Sothat's kind of like the only thing we know for sure right now. And then if you look really long-term what'sthe total energy -- like how many battery -- what's the total terawatt hours of installation -- of batteryinstallation that's needed to go to a fully renewable global economy taking into account transportation,current electrical needs, full electrification of transport, electrification of all heating and cooling, and thenthe current industrial uses and commercial uses of electricity like to go fully electric -- transport is abouthalf the size of everything else. That was sort of our global macro calculations. So ultimately, we thinkthings will get there, it could take a long time, but that's kind of where we think things will end up. Andyes, that's where we get to like the kind of 2 billion power pack number. Whether it's made by Tesla orother companies or some combination, that's kind of the number you need to get to go fully electric.

2015/5/6,"Our next phone question will come from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionJust wanted to build on, I think, Ryan Brinkman's question, on the fourth quarter cash flow guidance. Doesthat include income from those warehouse facilities to offset leased vehicles? Or is that exclusive of that?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerWell, our projection, as Elon said, was the end of the quarter, as we ramp up production, we should befree cash flow Positive on a pure sense. But frankly, our operations should be looked at without the impactof leasing. And that's a purer measure of operations, which is a lower threshold, I get it, but that's aunique or distinct decision we've made to be in that business.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsHold on a second, Pat. Deepak, do you want to explain about the classification of cash inflows within thestatement of cash flows?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerSure. Yes, if you look at our Q1 cash flows, for example, we received $155 million from our, either thewarehouse line or banking partners related to our leasing business. But that cash flow does not show upas an offset in our cash flow from operations. It shows up in our financing activities. So our cash flow fromoperations shows up $131 million Negative. But if you offset that against the $155 million that we receivedon the leasing business, we were slightly better than breakeven purely on an operations basis. And so ourreal cash flow in Q1 was driven by the strong CapEx spend ahead of the Model X launches, the way wetend to look at the business internally.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay, I appreciate that clarification. The other quick question I had is just I was a little surprised by the-- I think you guys had obviously very good gross margins this quarter relative to some of the headwindsthat you were facing. And I guess I was surprised to see that x ZEV, they go from 26 to 25. With someof the increases in pricing that you're putting through and some of the components that you're buyingoutside of the U.S. with a stronger dollar now, which -- where there was a little bit of a lag, I understand.I -- it just -- that seemed a bit conservative, and I don't know, maybe it ties back into Rod's earlier pointabout mix, but I guess that was one area that I was a little surprised.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerSo just to clarify, the price increase that we've announced is not going to help us in Q2 given our book ofbusiness.","The fourth quarter cash flow guidance does not include income from those warehouse facilities to offset leased vehicles.

2015/5/6,"It's going to primarily affect us in Q3.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd also in April, for most of April, the dollar was pretty strong. It's just trended in the last week or 10days or so, and we were continuing to deliver cars. So that strong dollar impact does roll over sequentiallyinto Q2 for us despite the lag effect of good news from a strong dollar. And as we said in the letter, wefully expect the mix impact to be offset by cost reductions that we will achieve. So it's really related to FXthat we see the sequential drop.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. The FX was really -- that was really a tricky thing to deal with. We had a quite strong European sales.And then the FX impact was quite significant. So obviously, if you've got a car that is, like let's say, 25%gross margin, and you've got -- and you see a 20% change in currency, it's like, wow, okay? That's notsuper easy to make up that difference.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. And to your point, and maybe this is a broader comment to make, that as we look at our Q1 non-GAAP loss that we have of $45 million, a big chunk or most of it could be attributed to the dollar strengththat has happened over the last 6 months. As we've indicated, our Q1 top line came down by about 3percentage points. And then we had the $22 million unrealized losses, from currency. You combine those2, and there's an offset in gross margin due to lower cost of parts we buy in foreign currencies. Butconsider this whole mix and you can see the foreign currency change over the last 6 months can explainmost of the losses we had in Q1.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionAnd, yes, maybe just like that last piece is kind of interesting. How much are you able to take advantageof that natural hedge you just described, right? Because you are buying components in currencies thathave also depreciated, right? Batteries are one obvious thing. I'm sure you're sourcing a lot of stuff inMexico. Are you close to optimizing that? Or is that something that can be kind of exercised more?Elon R.

It seems like there's a fair level of success there with$20 million in revenue. I'm just curious if you could mention how many vehicles were sold throughthat program, how many units remain in inventory there.

And to keep it at a high level, we're actually selling these cars at a fasterrate than we are getting these trade-ins to come in.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I'd hesitate to make predictions based on such early history. But I mean, I think there's room foroptimism in the future here because these are obviously very low -- we're not going to have to make thecars. So we're essentially getting a commission on selling the car, and it's very capital efficient. So I thinkthere's some upside potential there, but nothing we want to sort of really make predictions on until wehave more history.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionOkay. Maybe to think about it sort of in terms of -- I mean, every vehicle that's going into this pre-ownedprogram, I would imagine, is accompanied with a new Model S sale.

It's intended to be somewhat of a wash so thatif we achieve a $2,000 savings, we essentially pass that on to the end customer. And we don't knowwhat that's really going to look like until the program is complete, which is sort of almost 90 days fromnow.

2015/8/5,"Our next phone question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionA couple of questions. First, maybe you can just elaborate a little bit on the drop in the forecast from55,000 to 50,000 to 55,000. Is there some aspect of the Model X launch that isn't what you projected? Itdoesn't really sound like this is related at all to the backlog of orders from Model S.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectCorrect. I mean, we do think that it's going to be quite a challenging production ramp on the X. And ifwe are faced with a choice of -- to deliver a great -- we only want to deliver great cars. So we don't wantto drive to a number that's greater than our ability to deliver high-quality vehicles. And the nature ofthe production ramp, which is basically an exponential ramp that then becomes an S-curve, is basicallyfor every week, the longer it takes to climb up that exponential is about an 800-vehicle reduction of theX. But that's why we sort of we do want to emphasize the longer term, longer term really just meaninglike Q1 next year type of thing for long term.

Or are you thinking about this in terms of the fullcalendar year?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, so that's a good question. It's like -- they are -- yes, that's average over the year. So that means likein a given week, we might go as high as 2,000 to make up for holidays, factory retooling and that kind ofthing.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. Your run rate of gross margin, obviously, it's being affected by a number of things, by launches,by mix, the deferral of Autopilot revenue. Can you just talk a little bit about what are some of the issuesthere? What is the issue with Autopilot? Would we -- would it be reasonable to expect the margins to riseagain to the 25%-plus level once X is out and Gigafactory begins to ramp?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, definitely.","Elon Musk: We do think that it's going to be quite a challenging production ramp on the X. The longer it takes to climb up that exponential is about an 800-vehicle reduction of theX. But that's why we sort of we do want to emphasize the longer term, longer term really just meaninglike Q1 next year type of thing for long term.Deepak Ahuja: Would it be reasonable to expect the margins to riseagain to the 25%-plus level once X is out and Gigafactory begins to ramp?Elon R.

2015/8/5,"Most of the Autopilot deferral, we should be able to recover that later this year and maybea small portion going to 2016, but difficult to say at this point. And the 2 big issues that have beenaffecting us, I'd say, is the dollar, the strong dollar, and then the mix, especially as we have started tobuild 70D and the [indiscernible] Cars recently. The dollar has had huge impact. Just from Q1 to Q2, ittook 100 basis out for us roughly. So even after we consider all that and we look at 2016 to say that we'llbe at 25% and better, but the mix combined, yes, we should be there.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. And just lastly, you've had a few more weeks here since the announcement of the stationary storagebusiness. Do you have any additional thoughts on how that's expected to ramp?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. I want to back this with some degree of uncertainty because this is quite new. And again, we gotthat challenge of exponential ramp. And then depending on how you move, depending on how the baseover the next exponential ramp, the actual numbers within a given quarter could be quite different. Butthe demand has been really crazy, so it's well in excess -- I mean, if you just take the reservations thatwe made thus far, it's for well over $1 billion worth of Powerpacks and Powerwalls. And that's with nomarketing, no advertising, and no sales force to speak of really. We're not trying to sell it. It's basically apresentation and a webcast and 30 minutes of press Q&A. So there's probably room to improve. The -- sothis is -- I mean, we're really, we're basically sold out of what we could make in 2016 at this point, andassuming these orders are real, which we assume to be. So we're looking at maybe -- again, tracked thiswith a point [ph] of uncertainty, 40 million to 50 million in stationary storage in Q4, and maybe as muchas 10x that number in -- for next year. So it's 40 million to 50 million this year and 10x that next year.And I mean that growth rate is probably going to keep going at quite a level. It's probably at least a fewbillion dollars in 2017. But it's only speculative at this point, but I think that's likely.

2015/8/5,"And our next question will come from Trip Chowdhry with Global Equities Research.Trip ChowdhryGlobal Equities Research, LLCA couple of questions regarding the validation units. I was wondering regarding Model X, do we have ageneral ballpark number in terms of how many validation units we may have to produce before the robotsbecome smart enough?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI'm not sure I totally understand your question.Trip ChowdhryGlobal Equities Research, LLCLike when we had the Model S retooling, we created few a Model S validation units, I think probablyaround 40 or 50 units, which were used to train the robots. So before the product really goes intoproduction, I do believe there are some validation units of the car that are produced so as to train therobots. I could be wrong, but that's my understanding.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectNo, that's true. There are actually -- it's a little bit more complicated than that because there are parts ofthe factory that are much more automated than other parts. So in terms of the programming the robots,it varies quite a bit in terms of how much program there is, how difficult their programming is. But weactually have now produced several Model Xs off the Tesla production line. But this is a complex machinewith several thousand unique components. So there are still a lot of low-volume parts from the supplierson the Model X. But with each week, we keep building more and more Xs off the line with greater andgreater product maturity. And then as [indiscernible], we expect to draw our first delivery of productionModel Xs at the end of next month.Trip ChowdhryGlobal Equities Research, LLCI had a question on the Autopilot. I was wondering, are you aware of this research paper from LX [ph]?I think they also call it LX [ph]. In 2 conferences we ran, they talked a lot about image classification,especially with Nvidia. And if you haven't heard about it, that's fine. But if you have heard about it, I waswondering, are we working with some similar technologies with Autopilot?

I was wondering, in 2015, this currentyear, we are having a few retooling and getting the assembly lines, or I should say the production lines ofModel X and Model S a little up and coming. Do we see any similar disruption happening in 2016? Or arepretty much straight? And when we will put the Model 3 line in place, it will be completely isolated fromModel X and Model S?Elon R.

Is this a real -- I mean, forgetlike the 2020 for a moment. But is this a real business opportunity for Tesla supplying cars to ridesharingfirms?

What does that mean, if anything, for the earlier target of free cash flow breakeven in 4Q? Is thatsomething we should think about maybe more in 1Q '16 then?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerCertainly in 1Q, we will be free cash flow Positive. Q4, it's hard to predict given that range.

BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOkay, okay. That's helpful. And then last question, it seems like we've seen a number of announcementsin the third quarter now by utilities and other companies about using your Powerpack, companies likeAmazon, et cetera. I'm curious how much of the Tesla energy business do you now expect to generatefrom corporate or institutional demand versus more retail customers? I'd be interested too if this mix andexpectation, if it's changed over time at all since you first debuted the product.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerSure. This is J.B. We're getting a little bit better sense of it, but it's still early days. And I think initially,we thought that the majority of the business would be the Powerpack and the commercial or institutionalbusiness. And we've actually been a bit surprised at how strong Powerwall, the retail demand is and theinterest is.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, it's really early days. Because a big dependency here is when someone orders the Powerpack, howmany Powerpacks do they order? And so Powerpacks sort of 100 kilowatt hours, and industrial and utilitycustomers may order as many as 100 or 200. I'm not sure how our biggest order went so far. Is it like200?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerIt's [indiscernible] that, yes, on that order of magnitude.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, yes.

2015/8/5,"In terms of unit volume, thePowerwall would be the greatest. But the likely thing for Powerwall is somebody is going to order maybe 1to 3, maybe it's an average of 1.5 or something like that, whereas Powerpack could be an average of 5 to10.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, and I think as the market grows and as we go further into the future, we're going to see more andmore total energy demand coming from Powerpack. That's still our expectation.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, exactly. I mean, one thing to understand. [indiscernible] drawing this a little bit that for stationarystorage, the fundamental economics of cost are always true, meaning that there's always a costadvantage to someone -- to a systemwide implementation of stationary storage because of the high peakto trough electricity usage. So if you have buffering, which is what a stationary storage allows for, thenyou only need your power plants to operate at the average energy usage, which means that you canbasically, in principle, shut down half of the world's power plants if you have stationary storage. This isindependent of renewable energy. It does not matter whether you have solar panels or wind. This is justbeing able to shut down half of your power plants if you have buffering. Because you can then have yourpower plant output at the average of what is needed by the consumers. It seems like sometimes peoplelink this too much to renewable energy. Of course, we're huge believers in renewable energy, but thatis not the gating function of demand for stationary storage, stationary storage is really as compared toexisting power plants. And depending on the country, that may be represented at -- as a price to the userof the electricity. So for example in Germany and Australia, there is time-based cost of electricity. It'sgoing to cost more sometimes today than others. Whereas in most of the U.S., you just have a meterthat's taking over. So it doesn't differentiate between, say, day use of energy or night use of energy. Soin places where the price represents the cost, the Powerwall makes economic sense. But the Powerpackmakes sense everywhere.","In terms of unit volume, thePowerwall would be the greatest.

2015/8/5,"Our next phone question will come from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionI just wanted to follow up on the Autopilot, and I'm sorry if you guys have said this. But can we talk alittle bit more about the capability that that's going to bring? Is that kind of a hands-off feet-off kind ofproduct that would be somewhere close to like NHTSA Level 3? Or are we just talking about kind of morelane keep assist and forward collision warning, that sort of stuff that, that would still be kind of 1 to 2? Letme just start off with that question.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I'm not sure I'm familiar with what the various NHTSA levels mean, but I'll tell you what it willtranslate to in initial Autopilot. But we don't want to set the expectation that it's -- that you can justbasically pay no attention to what the car is doing. We do want to set the expectation that it's much likethe autopilot in a plane, where you turn the autopilot on in a plane but there's still the expectation thatthe pilot will pay attention to what the plane is doing and won't sort of go to sleep or disappear fromthe cockpit. So we don't want to set that expectation with the consumers. That said, in terms of whatthe capability of the system is, I think its capability in steering and control of acceleration and braking isexcellent when it has a tracking vehicle in front. And you can basically have high confidence in steering,braking and acceleration basically when you're in some kind of traffic situation, where there's a car in theroad in front of you. I think it's pretty good in the absence of that. So if there's just lanes, it's pretty good,and then it will get better over time as we refine the software.

I get that the production overallmight be lower based on a slower ramp. But is there something structural that's keeping you from hittingthat 2,000 on a run-rate basis, understanding that you can kind of surge to that at certain points?

I think there was like a $0.10 gain or a $0.13 gain on like FXrevaluation, like -- I don't know, Deepak, I didn't know what that was exactly.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, that's driven by our balance sheet currency and receivables revaluations that happened at the quarterend exchange rates.

So your comment suggested that the -- if there's anysort of delay towards the end of Q4, this would have an impact of about 800 Model X units per week. Andthen you're also guiding to about 1,600 to 1,800 combined volumes of production per week next year.Does that just simplistically mean that you're targeting the mix to be roughly 50-50 between X and S rightfrom the get-go in 2016?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectIt does. Although it's -- I wouldn't put too much precision on that because what we're going to try todo is to push the production slightly more in the direction of X because people have been waiting fora long time for their cars. And then in any given month, it could be 60-40 one way or the other. If youlook at worldwide demand for SUVs and sedans, it's almost dead even at 50-50. And in some regions,sedan's a favorite; some regions, SUV is a favorite. But generally it's, on a worldwide basis, 50-50. But itis difficult for us to say exactly what the S, X demand ratio will be until the car is out there and people areexperiencing it and we see what the relative order volume is. But we have so many advanced orders onthe X that that's something -- are not going to be an issue in the early days and we are going to try to getpeople their car as fast as we can.Emmanuel RosnerCLSA Limited, Research DivisionOkay.

So there's always some percentage lower than the capacity that is -- or like occasionally, youmay hit capacity, but it's hard to maintain capacity.

I think it is important just to remember they are speculative and not a predictionthat we would have, say, with very high confidence. But what we have found is -- with the Gigafactory,is that as we spent more and more time on it, we found we've been able to improve the space efficiencyof the production and the overall efficiency by more than our initial expectations.

StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, I think our plans are still on track and unchanged for the first phases of production to support Model3 and to support the Tesla energy business. But the ultimate production capability of the site is whatwe believe can go much higher than we may be initially thought it could. And we do remain on track forconstruction at the site. We'll have first equipments being installed at end of this year and planning tostart production on Tesla Energy products in Q1 2016.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectAnd in -- for Gigafactory, we're already in production...Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, Fremont.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, we're already in production with Tesla Energy products in Fremont, but that production will transfer tothe Gigafactory next year.Jeffrey B.","Elon R. Musk: It seems like with every country, you've got to build confidence in the brand over time. And it's -- it just takes time. Youcan't have it be immediate. And just because people love it in California does not mean they automaticallylove it in other places.Deepak Ahuja: We have been in China only slightly over a year. Elon Musk: Yes, just a year, yes.

Deepaks: It will be great for us if we can continue to grow the brand in China over the next year or so.Emmanuel RosnerCLSA Limited, Research DivisionUnderstood.

2015/8/5,"Our next phone question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionI've got two questions, one on the Powerwall -- excuse me, Powerpack opportunity, and another relatingback to Model S, Model X. On the Powerpack, I want to get sort of a deeper understanding of whereyou see your competitive advantage. As I think about simplicity 4 levels of a stack in terms of the utilityPowerpack solution with the upper level being sort of the grids. Software to interface with the grid kind oftie in when it's needed, when it's not needed. Second layer is the battery management software and thenat the hardware, the inverter and other power electronics followed by the battery itself. Where do you seeyour advantage at each of those levels? How is it important to play at all of those levels? And how do youinterface with some of the existing middle people, you might call them, or consultants in the industry orother software providers who might be providing elements of the stack already?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerLook, it's a pretty detailed question. I think one of the -- maybe the high level, one of the biggest benefitsthat we offer and where we have a competitive strength is having a system that solves pretty much all ofthose problems together. I think a lot of other people aspiring to be in this market sell one piece amongthat entire stack, as you're calling it, and then you'd have to go to different companies to find the otherpieces. In Tesla, we're integrating all those pieces together for a very turnkey solution that a utility or acommercial customer can just install. I think...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, basically, plug and play matters even if you're at the megawatt scale.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, exactly. And I think, of course, the pricing fundamentals, starting with the battery itself are reallythe foundation of that. But -- we have a lot of expertise and a lot of know-how in power electronics andsoftware as well that we've built on the car side of the business for many years.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionAnd how about the software to interface with the grid and determine when to charge, when to discharge?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, that's something we're working on now. And we're also working in partnership with many differentutilities on this. There's not a -- perhaps a universal point of view on exactly where that control and sortof dispatch should live.","Elon R. Musk: Plug and play matters even if you're at the megawatt scale.Jeffrey B.

2015/8/5,"A lot of utilities want to be very involved in that themselves. So we're basicallysetting up the tools and the infrastructure so that they can control in a way that's familiar and the mostconvenient for them.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectAnd especially like an API -- it's especially like the API so that their utility system can essentially call --can put or call power to the pack. And then they can query the pack for information about its status. Butas J.B. was saying, like, it does have to interface with quite a heterogeneous set of systems around theworld. So that's why you have to have basically an API interface to the pack saying sort of that the utilitysystem can request power or put power to the pack.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, and maybe just one more comment. At the commercial level, that is something that Tesla is engagedin much more directly for things like demand management and those type of applications. But it's a bit ofa different answer depending on which market we're in here.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionAnd so how are you giving the utilities comfort with the cycle -- number of cycles and the lifetime of this?Are they sort of taking your word for it? Or is that something they're seeking to explore through pilotsand/or their own high-intensity testing of your battery packs?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, we have a lot of data, actually. It's not -- they don't just have to take our word for it. A lot of thesetests have been running for a long time, and we can show them fairly hard cycle data and some lifetimedata. So that's been very helpful. And also of course, there's all the sort of field experience from theautomotive fleet. That is much bigger than what we're deploying in the stationary fleet and will remain sofor a number of years. So having the confidence there and how those batteries have aged and done quitewell is extremely helpful in building out our confidence.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionGot it. And just final quick question. Model S, you noted some risk to 4Q depending on what happens withthe X ramp-up. Earlier in the year, you talked about a 30% gross margin for the Model S prior to 4Q, ofcourse that was not for 4Q overall. Where do you stand on that 30% internal goal now?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, that 30% goal was before the dollar began to really strengthen at this level.","Elon R.

There are various other cost reduction opportunities that we have that weare hoping to get in Q4 but they could potentially get delayed into Q1. We want to make sure they happenright. And we are, at the same time, focusing on X. so I would say, broadly, if we put aside exchange, wesee a trend of improving gross margin despite mix over time.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay.

The $1 billion, isthat orders or reservations? I just want to get a sense of how firm that was. And did you imply that -- itsounds like 400 -- $400 million to $500 million for next year? And is it a few billion for 2017 at the storagemarket? Is that what you said?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. These are reservations, so you can -- reservation may be an order or maybe not, but that's certainlywhat people said that they want. The -- yes, so that's over 100,000 reservations have been placedfor Powerwall and Powerpack. And of that, there's -- you can suspect that is what the -- how manyPowerwalls and how many Powerpacks per reservation. It's likely to be more than 1, so -- particularly onthe Powerpack case. So yes, that's what leads us to think $40 million to $50 million Q4, maybe 10x thatnumber next year, and then 5x to 10x that number in 2017.

Almost none.Therefore, Tesla will sell almost none."" That's to summarize what the vast majority of predictions wereabout the Model S.Jeffrey B.

And also, I guessone more just along with that, is there any supplier in particular that's concerning you?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI mean, I sort of -- I don't want to sort of name specific suppliers. But our biggest challenges are with thesecond row seat. It's an amazing seat, like a sculptural work of art, but a very tricky thing to get right.The falcon wing door actually seems to probably not be the -- not be a critical-path item. There are someinterior components, interior trim that are -- possibly on a critical path. So it's very hard to say exactlywhat lies in the critical path because it tends -- these things tend to play a scheduled leapfrog. And it'skind of a set of constraints that one day, it's this constraint, then the next day, it's another constraint. Andthe pace of progress is really dependent on which supplier is the slowest and least lucky. So if a supplierhas unexpected challenges, which can range from force majeure to somebody having to redo a designbecause the initial design was wrong. When you have a complex product like Model S with thousands of-- that's dependent on thousands of suppliers, you can say that the pace of progress is determined by thethousandth least lucky and slowest.

Can help us understand the significance, and then alsomaybe paint it in terms what you're doing in the factory this year that's going to actually be repurposed orcan even be used toward Model 3 production.Elon R.

And we've alsomade a significant investment in stamping and some sort of advanced metal sheet forming technologythat isn't stamping. Yes, and J.B., you want to add to that?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerI think in plastics and paint, especially paint, we made modifications there on the existing paint shop aswe're getting the new one ready.

2015/11/3,"So we're trying to scale our production as much aspossible. I mean, we've -- by almost any metric -- we're -- if we imagine the most we could possiblymake in 2016, we've already sold out of that. Or at least, if you were to take even a small fraction ofthe number of people that have placed orders and assume that those orders are valid, even if a smallportion of those are valid, we would be sold out of all of 2016 production, maybe well into 2017. Soit's really mostly about predicting our production rate, and yes, we expect very dramatic increases inthe stationary storage production. The reason I feel a bit cautious about giving exact estimates is thatwhen you have an exponential increase, the exact calendar window over which the -- that you place thatexponential, has quite a big impact on the numbers. So -- and in fact, in general, at Tesla, I want to bea little more cautious about giving quarterly numbers, particularly when we have very dramatic ramps,like the example is with the Model X. You can imagine, if you have strict calendar windows and you placethem over the beginning of an exponential, or slightly to the right or slightly more to the right, the actualdifferences are quite dramatic. So like you know where it's going to end up, but not what it looks like inthat rapidly changing S curve situation. Yes, so...Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionAnd then, on the margins side, is that still on target? And that's it.Elon R.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectOh, 15%, yes. Mostly -- we -- yes, I don't think there's going to be any problem hitting a 15% margintarget.

2015/11/3,"Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Stifel.James Joseph AlbertineStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research DivisionGreat. Just a point of clarification, first, on the announcement of the 40,000 vehicles that you rolled theAutopilot feature out to over the air. Can you just clarify, once rolled it's out over the air, is there, then, apoint at which the consumer has to determine to spend, I think it's $2,500, to activate it? And is there anydetail you can provide us on those that are paying to activate the Autopilot feature at this time?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectMost people who ordered the car actually ordered with the Autopilot convenience features. So theAutopilot safety features are default on -- in all vehicles. This is automatic emergency braking, sidecollision avoidance, forward-collision warning, that kind of thing. The convenience features like Autosteer,Autopark, are $2,500, but like most people have actually -- had actually already ordered that. So thosethat hadn't -- haven't ordered it can actually turn it on for -- it's actually slightly more if you get it afterthe fact, for -- turn it on for $3,000.

With other manufacturers, theytend to sort of bundle everything together in a model year. In our case, it's a series of rolling changes, somodel year doesn't mean as much.

A couple of questions, just one on the battery side. I think a lot of us were surprised atthe GM Analyst Day. They put a slide up which said that they were working on a battery that was $145a kilowatt hour. That probably didn't include the pack cost, but even adjusting for that, that seemed likea pretty low number. And I don't know, maybe J.B., how did you guys react to that presentation? Is itrealistic? I mean, are you worried about the threat of a large form-factor battery being the same cost asyours within kind of a 1- to 2-year time frame, would be my first question.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, we definitely read the report and we're not terribly concerned about it. I think, also, there was a lotof confusion in that particular report and some of the comments following about sell price versus packcost. And in general, we're quite comfortable in our position with the type of cells and the form factorswe're using.

2015/11/3,"Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionI had a couple of questions. Just first on Model X, I just wanted to confirm, did you say you thoughtyou can get a few hundred produced and delivered by year-end? And just so that we understand what'sbeen happening here, is it just the seat at this point? Or are there other unique challenges that you thinkprospectively affect the ramp of the vehicle?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectNo, to be precise, I said several hundred per week, that we expect to reach the production rate of severalhundred per week next month. And it's difficult to predict the exact number that will be developed,because it -- because of what I was mentioning earlier of like we're on kind of an exponential ramp. Soexactly -- one week this way or that can actually make a significant number -- significant impact in theabsolute number of vehicles delivered. But we do feel comfortable, at this point, of reaching the severalhundred per week production rate before the end of the year, i.e., next month. And the issues are a bunchof little things. I mean, doors seals right now is a challenge, for example. The monopost seat in the secondrow is still a challenge, but less of a challenge. It's not the gating factor.

Obviously, you guys are pulling the second-row seats in-house for theModel X, and there have certainly been some acquisitions and work you've done on forging and casting.I'm just curious, as you look at production going forward for the Model X, and even the Model 3, if therewould be opportunity to in-source more parts to really kind of solve the issues you're facing with someof these suppliers.

And if you get that right and can in-source more, if you could potentially increase the cadence ofyour product introductions and the product launches themselves.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I totally agree with that. That's exactly -- that's the reason -- like we've only, actually, in the wholehistory of Tesla, only done one tiny acquisition, and that was Riviera Tooling in Michigan. And we'replanning to use that as a hub to recruit top tool and die manufacturers, so basically tool and die engineers,to Tesla Michigan, and with that exact goal, which is, how do we reduce our critical path to -- our timeto market for new products? Because we end up being constrained by, basically, tools and molds. Andanything we can do to tighten that time frame, organically-wise, an acquisition is a good thing.

So clearly, as we act on all of those directions and add volume,we see a path that we can achieve that. And it's a lot of hard work, and we need to do it.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionOkay. Maybe you'd prefer to shrink [ph] up the model a little bit low and let you guys get there?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. Yes, absolutely. And we're just -- we're describing that this is our goal, and we believe we've got aplan to get there. But we -- there could be unexpected issues along the way that prevent us from gettingthere. But I mean, I think, we'll certainly be better than where we are today.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI mean, that's like quite certain.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAssuming constant dollar. Some if these external things [ph].Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, yes.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionOkay, and just 2 more. When -- can you give us...Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsAndrea, we've really got a lot of people that want to ask questions yet.","A year ago, you guys had been targeting 28% to 30% gross margins by around this time. But clearly, theworld changed on you with currencies and so forth. So what's the right way to think about gross marginover the next 18 months?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, we -- our goal is to steadily improve gross margin, and hopefully exceed 30% on the S and Xvehicles within 18 months, hopefully sooner than that. But it is -- it does require quite an intense effortto -- for every fraction of a point of gross margin. And it's a lot of hard work, and we need to do it. And that assumes current -- there's not someradical shift in currencies that happens again. So the -- so yes, if according to our plans, at least, wewould exceed 30%.",,
2015/11/3,"Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.Emmanuel RosnerCLSA Limited, Research DivisionI wanted to first ask, just put a finer point on the fourth quarter. So deliveries of 17,000 to 19,000 unitsseems like not a huge contribution from Model X within this. How do you ramp up the Model S deliveriessequentially so fast? I mean, it doesn't look like in the, I guess, in the Model S history, we've seen sort oflike such a sequential increase in deliveries like so. What are you doing, I guess, better in this particularquarter?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, it's not as big a leap as it might seem from Q4 to Q3 because there's a whole weak missing fromQ3. And we continue to ramp the rate all the way from beginning of Q3 through end of year for Model S.So it's actually not too much of a stretch, or less of a stretch than it may seem. And certainly, we've hadmuch bigger sequential jumps before than this. It's worth noting that 2015 -- in 2010, Tesla was delivering500 cars per year. We now deliver 500 cars in just over 2 days.Emmanuel RosnerCLSA Limited, Research DivisionOkay, that's helpful. And then, just on -- again, a final point just on the Model X for this particular quarter.It sounds like your -- have you actually started production? Sounds like you're still working out someissues there. And what has essentially surprised you as you sort of like ramped this up, which is causingmaybe the actual production in larger numbers to be maybe slightly later than it would have been?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, I mean, the thing about a car is because there's several thousand unique components in the car,the production can only move as fast as the slowest component. So even though 99% of the Model X isready for high production, less than 1% of the parts are not, but those are what drive the rate. So that'sthe thing that makes a car -- vehicle production really, really challenging and the vehicle ramp reallychallenging. And you don't know in advance what those issues are going to be or you would do somethingabout it. So that's the -- yes. And then, you can basically think of it like the production will move as fastas the least lucky supplier that we have in our network, so yes.","Elon R.

2015/11/3,"Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionJust maybe going back to the Dieselgate issue again, but from a bigger-picture perspective. I'm curiouswhat impact you see to the electric vehicle market from these revelations at VW. Could it increase thedemand for electric vehicles to your benefit? Does it maybe make nonelectric vehicles more expensiveto produce to truly comply with the emission regulations? Does that help the Model 3 be more cost-competitive? I'm just curious what impact you see overall to the industry, and then to Tesla specifically.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, I mean, the -- this has really shined a spotlight on the whole emissions testing process. And I mean,it's now obvious to consumers that gasoline and -- well, especially diesel, but also gasoline cars have real-world emissions that are substantially greater than what's experienced in the tests, when they go throughtesting. And I think that what one would naturally expect from this is that regulators will no longer turna blind eye to these things, and so the cost of producing gasoline and diesel cars that actually meet thelegal emissions requirements is going to be quite a bit higher. So I would expect the car companies toaccelerate their plans for electric vehicles, which is great, and there might be some near-term benefit toTesla. But I mean, thus far, we haven't actually seen it, but there might be one.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOkay, great. And then, just last question. I understand that deliveries for the Model X initially are clearlya function of how many you can build, given your large backlog of orders. But in trying to estimate whatdemand might look like, more medium to long term, is there anything more that you can say now or thatcan be shared about the pricing of the vehicle beyond Signature Series?Elon R.

Inc., Research DivisionCan you talk a little bit about the acceleration in the ramp of the Gigafactory? What are you seeing atthis point in terms of your ability to fully accelerate in 2016? And when do you think, we might see cellscoming out of the factory and into cars?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, in particular, as we have mentioned, we've accelerated the production of Tesla Energy products atthe Gigafactory. So that's what has started just recently there, and that was quite a bit ahead of plan.That's happening in a separate section of the factory from where the cells will be produced, but also, aswe discussed, we do expect that cell production will start up the second half of next year, which is, again,a little bit ahead of plan. And some of those cells would initially be allocated toward Tesla Energy products.And we still are targeting around 2017 for the first cell production that would be going into vehicles andinto the Model 3.

2015/11/3,"Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionYes, kind of 3 quick questions, or 2 quick ones, one more philosophical. First, again, on the 4Q, you talkedabout building up finished goods inventory. We don't have the file numbers yet, but for the last quarterproduction outpaced deliveries, and you're guiding to that for 4Q. So what's going to be different in termsof hitting that ramp-up on deliveries for Model S in 4Q vis-?-vis drawing down that inventory?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYou're referring -- so for model S?Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionYes, for Model S.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, I mean, as we indicated in the letter, we were carrying higher finished goods inventory that was intransit at end of Q3 to support those higher deliveries in Q4, and it's the drawdown of that extra inventorythat allows us to do that. Our ending inventory at Q4 is going to be no different than what we have hada few quarters back.

I mean, as much as you're pursuing a different model on the battery side,it looks like there's a lot of capital going into tooling and all these complicated mechanical things, not tomention service. As you kind of think forward 3 years, is that, more or less, the way you're going to spendcapital? Or is there anything you could do to kind of be more asset-light in the process?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerI mean, I think, stepping back, maybe the better way to look at it is that at Tesla our CapEx spend forwhat we are achieving, in my mind, has been really efficient in the industry.Elon R.","Elon R.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jeffrey Evanson. Sir, you may begin.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsThank you, Latiff, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015Q&A Webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Tesla Chairman and CEO; J.B. Straubel, our CTO; CFO,Jason Wheeler; and Jon McNeill, President of Global Sales, Service and Delivery.Our Q4 results are announced in the update letter at the same link as this webcast. As usual, this letterincludes GAAP and non-GAAP financial information and reconciliations between the 2.During our call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These arebased on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially dueto a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent Form 10-Q filed withthe SEC.We're going to start today's call with some comments by Elon and then Jason, and then we'll go into theQ&A session. And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Elon.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectThank you. So I think the newsletter probably speaks for itself, but I'll add some commentary on some ofthe lead points.So obviously, we had a huge increase in Model S deliveries year-on-year in Q4 last year, going up 76%.We had a huge change in our core operational cash flow, which you can really see in the chart, and it'sreally quite dramatic. That's why I think it's interesting to look at in chart form. It goes from Negative tosignificantly Positive in Q4 last year. And then we made modest improvements in Model S gross margin,getting to about 25% excluding onetime items, and we feel pretty good about where we're tracking toprobably get close to 30% by the -- by about Q4 this year.And then something I'm personally quite excited about is that we expect to be Positive cash flow startingnext month and then continue on into Q2 and beyond. And that's -- there's only one caveat there that'sincluding the asset-backed line, and the asset-backed line is -- that's just funding for cars that are enroute to customers. So particularly as sales to international markets increases, there's more finishedgoods inventory on its way to customers. And so inclusive of the asset-backed line, which really I think is-- was accurately regarded as a slight decrease in the gross margin of the car by about roughly 0.1% orthereabouts.","Elon Musk, J.B.

2016/2/10,"So that's, I think, quite interesting. We also have far fewer salesoutlets than our competitors. Essentially, there's a lot of degrees of freedom that we are not exercisingthat we could, in theory, exercise.I think -- oh, and if you look at the text, it's worth noting that this is not just uniquely true in the UnitedStates. But in Switzerland, we outsold -- the Model S outsold the Mercedes S-Class, the BMW 7 Series,Porsche Panamera and the Audi 8 combined and also outsold the Mercedes E-Class. And in Germany, weoutsold the Porsche Panamera. So I think these are pretty good situations. I mean, this is even in placesthat have no incentives. Obviously, incentives are certainly helpful. They're a catalyst for sales. They're --so Tesla always appreciates the incentives, and I think they make a difference in accelerating the adventof electric vehicles. But sometimes incentives are characterized as it's sort of all about incentives or not atall about incentives. And it's really important to appreciate that incentives are an accelerant. But that's thereality of them.Jason, do you want to add anything?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure, absolutely. Thanks, Elon. First of all, I look forward to working with everybody. I'm super excited tobe here, as excited as I was on the first day I walked through the door.Just 3 quick things I want to touch on real quick. Number one, gross margin, lots of moving parts thisquarter. And let me walk you guys through it a little bit. We had over $67 million in Model X ramp-up costsand nonrecurring items in the quarter, as Elon mentioned. Correcting for these items, automotive grossmargin, excluding ZEV credits, would have been 25%.First thing, the major component here is labor and overhead and depreciation related to the Model Xlaunch. The way for you all to think about this is towards end of Q3 and into Q4, we had to bring theworkforce into the factory to build these wonderful vehicles. Also, as soon as start-up production starts,the clock starts hitting on depreciation as well. So that's what's going on there. We also had some assetimpairments, one with our old paint shop. And we've now got a state-of-the-art paint shop in place, whichis going to give us the capacity that we need all the way through Model 3...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, that's 10,000 cars a week too.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, 10,000 cars a week.","In Switzerland, we outsold -- the Model S outsold the Mercedes S-Class, the BMW 7 Series,Porsche Panamera and the Audi 8 combined.

2016/2/10,"So this is a good story, and these are assets that we had purchased all -- go allthe way back to the NUMMI days. So we got every bit of life out of those assets as we possibly could.The other big piece here is we had an E&O write-off, excess and obsolescence. This is a result of betterproduction control and inventory management systems that we put in place. The place is moving reallyfast, and we took some time, Elon talked about this in Q2 on the earnings call during the shutdown,putting better systems in place to track this. We're moving to a place where we're tracking E&O on a real-time basis and bringing those facts to the table when we're making decisions. So we shouldn't be in thisposition again.Next thing I wanted to talk about just real quickly was cash flow. And Elon covered this, and I thinkthe chart on the face of the shareholder letter really gets there. But we were within striking distance ofPositive operating cash flows there. And when you add back the leasing proceeds that we get of $209million, it's a great step change in the right direction to getting us to net cash flow Positive.Also CapEx, we guided to $500 million last quarter on the call, and we closed out at $411 million for thequarter. That all resulted in ending cash balance being at $1.2 billion, which I think showcases our strongimprovement in cash management and discipline with the company.Finally and really quickly, talk about capital structure. We closed the warehouse line that we previouslyhad before and opened the ABL, as Elon mentioned. Think of this as a shift to lower-cost financing. We'vegot a better deal on this line. So I think it's a better way to think about that. Intended uses, one, we'llcontinue to monetize our direct leases as we did with the warehouse line. But it also creates an option forus to finance our ramp in FGI as the Model X hits full production scale.I'll just close by saying my mandate from Elon is clear: Cash is king. And there's some real steps thatwe're taking as a company to get ourselves to net cash flow Positive for the year...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectAnd profitability.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerAnd profitability. One more, it's just capital efficiency in CapEx.

2016/2/10,"We started to see some of this in Q4. It will continue. We're also gettingto a point where we have operating leverage in the business. We'll continue to aggressively manage ourgrowth in expenses. And then finally, and I walk around and I'm on this every day, is a relentless focus onautomotive unit cost reductions.So that's my mandate. Again, I'm happy to be here. And Elon, if you've got nothing else, we go to Q&A.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. Actually, I guess one other point that's sort of interesting to note is that Tesla is approximatelydoubling its cumulative sales every year. So this is -- I'm not sure if this has happened in the car industryfor maybe a century. But like we started the beginning of last year with 50,000 cars en route, then weended with 100,000.

Inc., Research DivisionSo you're coming to, in the next couple quarters, to the end of some of the initial leases on the Model Ss.Can you talk a little bit about your preparations for that and your expectations as we move throughout thisyear on what will happen with those cars and how many of them are actually going to get returned?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectSure. Jon, do you want to talk about that?Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales and ServiceSure. So we actually started on that early and launched the campaign in the second half of 2015 to reachout to folks who had cars coming off lease. And one of the attractive things to those folks who werecoming off a lease is have a car that's equipped with Autopilot. And Autopilot is certainly one of the corestories of what's going on here at Tesla. It's really exciting. And so we're finding that folks are willing toupgrade their Tesla as part of this campaign. And so we've got this formal program where we're reallyproviding a smooth transition period for these cars. In addition to that, we're finding there's a very healthyaftermarket for these cars. And the trade-in values, or the trading values in the market are significantlyabove our residual reserves on the cars, which is giving us some flexibility in terms of our financingpartners offering very attractive monthly payments and loan terms because the cars are holding -- theTeslas are holding value at a much higher rate than we thought.

So we took basically every action we couldto suppress demand for the X because production wasn't -- we needed to get production up. There wasno point in amplifying demand if the production cannot meet that demand. So we did our best to reallysuppress demand or certainly not encourage demand. That will obviously change in the balance of thisyear as we get cars to stores because there have been no Model Xs at the stores, no Model Xs availablefor test drives.

Because you're still -- of cash, I'msorry -- kind of still burning $200 million this quarter. Is it just really all volume to get back to get cashflow Positive by Q2? You also touched on CapEx. Do you have it -- you're saying it's going to be flat todown, but there's -- it seems like there's an awful lot of work going on in the company. I mean, how doyou keep CapEx down as you have all these growth plans?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure. So the key drivers on cash flow Positive. So as I said in my earlier comments, it's a great stepin that operations, the business is selling cars and energy products is now producing enough cash for us tostart to pay for our investments. And if you look at the Q4 dynamics, that cash flow from core operations,as we're calling it, produced 40% to 45% of the cash that we needed for the CapEx in the quarter. Sothat is certainly a big piece of it, too. Another piece of it, as I mentioned, is just going to be operatingleverage. We need to be very diligent about how we grow operating costs, certainly. And then the otherbig element to it is certainly continuing to drive cost downs on the vehicles, and there's lots of ways to dothat. We're getting better at our manufacturing processes. We're reducing scrap. We're reducing excessand obsolescence. As we talk about in the letter, the car continues to be more and more reliable. So thatreduces our warranty, and that actually has a cash impact when the cars show up less at the servicecenters.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes.

So there are -- globally, it's split almost 50-50. And so the X is kind of like half of our volume.And so if you set a company up to produce X and -- let me use -- not use the variable X. If you set acompany up to produce a certain amount of revenue and then it produces maybe just over half thatamount of revenue but has the cost base associated with it, but then obviously, the -- things will not bepretty from a cash flow and profitability standpoint.

2016/2/10,"Our next question comes from Jamie Albertine of Stifel.James Joseph AlbertineStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research DivisionOn the Model 3, if I may, just I think a lot of folks are trying to do work as it relates on the margintrajectory over time. And it's clearly going to be volume dependent and sort of timing around the launch.But I was wondering if you could help us understand. Just given that it's 1/3 of the transaction price ofroughly your initial Model X deliveries, what are some of the efficiencies you're hoping that you can sortof draw upon maybe beyond just sort of the battery reduction -- battery cost reductions? What are youleveraging in the Model 3 from investments you've already made and sort of the knowledge you havearound sort of initial launch costs and the higher-price vehicles at this point?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I think the way to think of the cost difference is really that the Model 3, being a sedan, is about 20%lighter than -- and actually quite a bit less complex to manufacture than the Model S. The Model S wasreally the first car we ever made ourselves. So it was -- we were designing to make it work as opposedto designing it from ease of manufacturing, whereas the 3 is really designed for ease of manufacturing.And then we expect, through economies of scale and just general design improvements, to get another30% improvement. So that's where the 50% improvement comes relative to the S. So sort of 35k versus70k of 3 versus S is the way to think about the difference. And our default plan, as we've done in the past,is that the initial sales are relatively highly optioned versions of the car because, obviously, we've got topay back the investment of all the tooling and everything. So that sort of makes sense to have the higher-optioned versions first. So that's what we did with the S and obviously, again with the X. While it was sortof unfortunate that -- of the way the X pricing got reported that they reported the sort of fully optionedsignature series as though it was the base price volume number in some publications. So this was justa misunderstanding of how things work. I mean, it's -- and I think it's also normal procedures in manyother industries like for -- if Intel comes out with a new CPU or faster CPU or NVIDIA comes out with anew graphics card, the -- in the beginning, it's a lot more expensive.","The Model 3, being a sedan, is about 20%lighter than -- and actually quite a bit less complex to manufacture than the Model S.

If we back out the 16,000 for Q1, it looks like about 23,000 per quarter for Q3 -- or Q2 through Q4,which it seems like you should be there with production given the Model X expectations and the Model Sproduction expectations as well.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectLike I say, I know you'd love to have sort of more granularity, but it's difficult for us to give you granularitythat we ourselves don't have. That's excessive precision. I don't want to give false precision, so it's --I -- we feel good about like the overall number, but it might be around as to how it gets to that overallnumber. And there's always unforeseen things that occur. So that's why we kind of need some flexibility sowe don't provide false precision and then people hold us to false precision.Tyler Charles FrankRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionOkay. And then can you comment on what you're seeing for overall demand in the China market? Andthen what markets do you expect to move into next with which [indiscernible] and how that ramp will go?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, China is not a huge market for us and hasn't been historically. It is something we expect in the longterm will be a big market and ultimately, probably our biggest market. So I think there's a lot of long-term opportunity there. So that's -- it would be -- it's difficult to say what's going to happen with Chinain the short term except that it doesn't really have a big effect on Tesla. Yes, I mean, long term, it wouldbe. In terms of the new markets, I'm really excited to launch in Mexico this year. I'll be heading out toMexico City, and we're going to -- I think there's actually quite a good opportunity there. And some ofour customers -- we actually have customers in Mexico already, but having a significant presence there, Ithink, is going to be great. And some of our most supportive customers are actually in Mexico.Tyler Charles FrankRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionThen a quick follow-up. There's been some rumors and commentary that the Model 3 launch may not bean actual full vehicle.","If we back out the 16,000 for Q1, it looks like about 23,000 per quarter for Q3 -- or Q2 through Q4,which it seems like you should be there with production given the Model X expectations and the Model Sproduction expectations as well.

2016/2/10,"Our next question comes from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionYou commented earlier, Elon, on the Model S versus the Model X demand being personal preferenceon passenger car versus SUV. And I was just wondering if you have any thoughts on whether ModelS demand would or could be affected once the Model 3 is revealed. Do you think that those vehiclesultimately go to different customers? Or is there a plan to avoid cannibalization there?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I mean, I think there's -- that they are different market segments, much as, say, the BMW 7 Seriesand 5 Series are -- and 6 are different -- they're different market segments from the 3 Series. And youshould think of the Model 3 as sort of sort of -- for really competing in kind of the BMW 3 Series or AudiA4 market, and so if you want the sort of ultimate machine, you'd really want to get the Model S. But theModel 3 will be a great car.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. Maybe also just as an anecdote, there was a lot of concern when we launched the X aboutcannibalization of Model S demand. And we actually saw just the opposite, which was the increasedinterest and awareness and just customer engagement actually drove higher Model S sales even as theX was launched. So -- and those are actually much closer in terms of vehicle capability as we just talkedabout.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionYes, yes, it makes sense. And I was hoping just on the financial side, can you give us just a little bit of asense of how challenging it would be -- it will be to get to that 25% Model X gross margin? And can youcomment at all on how you're expecting for the overall company gross margins would look this year? Areyou expecting them to be able to stay above 25% even with the Model X ramping?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. So as we said in the letter, 25% by the end of the year for Model X -- sorry, I'm a little under theweather -- and 30% for the Model S. So you can do the math on what the blended rate will look like. Interms of getting to 25% for Model X, we have to think about it as we've got many years of history withthe Model S right now.","Elon R.

2016/2/10,"The next question comes from Dee-Ann Durbin of Associated Press.Dee-Ann DurbinConsidering now that the Chevy Bolt is going to go on sale at the end of this year, so that'll be a full yearthat it's on sale before Model 3 arrives, does that -- I mean, has it taken any wind out of your sails? And-- or do you think, again, that these are very different customers? If you're comparing to an Audi A4, forexample, are people still going to be attracted to the Model 3 even though they'll have that option on themarket quite a while before the Model 3 arrives?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, I mean, I would sort of point you to the market share of large luxury vehicles or large premiumsedan sales in the U.S. that I talked about earlier in the call. We're currently outsell everyone in thatcategory and had a 51% market growth last year where everyone else declined and the market as a wholedeclined. So I mean, if Model 3 is at all similar in its market segment, it doesn't seem like we're going tobe demand constrained.Dee-Ann DurbinOkay. And I know you don't do any marketing, but I'm wondering if you would ever possibly reconsiderthat. It struck me when you were saying that you aren't where you could be on the East Coast and thatmay be because people need more educating about how the car performs in the snow or whatever, do youthink there's ever a point at which you might reconsider and do some very targeted marketing in placeswhere you think you could do better?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I don't think it's in the near -- I don't think we'd do that in the near term. But in the long term, Ithink I could see us doing advertising where that advertising was interesting, entertaining and peopledon't regret seeing it, which unfortunately, is not the case for most advertising. So I mean, if there's sortof something interesting and artistic or just like you -- it's entertaining, it's like wouldn't waste people'stime if they saw it. And also, I think we need to have a more affordable, high-volume car, before thatmakes sense, like the Model 3, so that it's more accessible. So if we do mass media, then it's more likelythat somebody could buy the car. And that's kind of the point when it would be something we'd consider.","The Chevy Bolt is going to go on sale at the end of this year, so that'll be a full yearthat it's on sale before Model 3 arrives.

Are you guys noticing any slowdown in the pace of orders?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectJon, do you want to...Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales and ServiceYes, I think, Phil, it's a great question.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jeff Evanson. Mr. Evanson, you may begin.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsThank you, Cherie, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2016 Q&A Webcast.I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Tesla Chairman and CEO; J.B. Straubel, our CTO; CFO Jason Wheeler; andJon McNeill, President of Global Sales, Service and Delivery.Our Q1 results are announced in the update letter at the same link as this webcast. As usual, this letterincludes GAAP and non-GAAP financial information and reconciliations between the 2.During our call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These arebased on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially dueto a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recently filed Form 10-K atthe SEC website.We're going to start today's call with some comments by Elon, followed by the question-and-answerperiod. Elon, I'll turn it over to you.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectAll right. Thank you. The -- I think the most important point here that we want to make is that we'readvancing the Q3 -- I'm sorry, the Model 3 build plan substantially. So -- and just overall -- the overallvolume plan, with Tesla aiming get to the 0.5 million unit per year run rate in 2018 instead of 2020. Andthis is based off of the tremendous demand we see for the Model 3, which I think is actually a fractionof the ultimate demand when people fully understand what the car's capable of and are able to do a testdrive. So this is probably the biggest change strategically.I think also, Tesla is going to be hell-bent on becoming the best manufacturer on earth. So the -- thus far,I think we've done a good job on design and technology of our products. The Model S and X, I think, aregenerally regarded by very critical judges as technologically the most advanced cars in the world. And sothe -- I think, we've done well in that respect.The key thing we need to achieve in the future is to also be the leader in manufacturing. So we takemanufacturing very seriously at Tesla. It's the thing that we need to obviously solve if we are going toscale and scale rapidly and make the cars more affordable.","Elon Musk, Tesla Chairman and CEO, and J.B.

2016/5/4,"So that's -- I really want to sort of send themessage out there to those -- to the best manufacturing people in the world, we want you to come joinour company. And that is going to be the primary focus of Tesla is how do we get super good at makinglarge, complex objects.So that's the -- I think, the most salient point. It's easy to get wrapped up in like a bunch of sort of short-term issues, but I think in terms of what matters in the future, I think that's the most significant thing.Overall, on the short-term stuff, our quarter-over-quarter stuff, I think, has improved quite significantly.Obviously, Model X production increased by a factor of 5 from Q4 to Q1, and we continue to make hugestrides in volume and quality of the vehicle. And I'm personally spending an enormous amount of timeon the production line. My desk is at the end of the production line. I have a sleeping bag in a conferenceroom adjacent to the production line, which I use quite frequently. The whole team is super focused onachieving rate and quality and at the target cost. So that's -- I feel very confident in us achieving thatgoal.And with the increase in ramp, we do feel comfortable affirming the 80,000 to 90,000 deliveries this year.So that's -- yes, I think what -- it's just the rate of improvement with each passing day is very significant.And let's see, finally, I'd like to sort of thank Greg Reichow, who was our head of production, fortremendous contribution over the last 5 years. Greg is still -- contrary to some media reports, Greg isstill at Tesla. He's still with the company, and he's helping with the transition to sort of -- to some newleadership. And we have some, I think, exciting announcements coming in the next -- possibly in the nextfew weeks about additions to the Tesla management team on the productions side.So that -- I'm feeling really, really excited about where things are heading in that direction.With that, let's go to questions.","I think in terms of what matters in the future, I think that's the most significant thing.

2016/5/4,"Our first question comes from James Albertine of Stifel.James Joseph AlbertineStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research DivisionThere's no doubt you have an incredible undertaking in front of you. Can you help us understand some ofthe key obstacles and how we should consider those obstacles between now and your anticipated launchof the Model 3 in late 2017, whether it's sort of P&L adjustments that we need to make along the way? Butcan you just help us sort of choreograph how that's going to take place?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectSure. So with the Model 3, as I mentioned on the last earnings call, we're really try to take a lot oflessons learned from Model X, where -- Model X, we put a lot of bells and whistles on Model X and a lotof advanced technologies that weren't necessarily for version 1 of the vehicle. With Model 3, we're beingincredibly rigorous about ensuring that we don't have anything that isn't really necessary to make a verycompelling version 1 of the car. We also have a much tighter feedback loop between design engineering,manufacturing engineering and production. And so no element of Model 3 can be approved unlessmanufacturing has said that this is easy to manufacture and that the risks associated with manufacturingit is low. There are many ways to skin a cat, and it's remarkable how you can achieve the same objectivewith a hugely varying degree of difficulty. You can sort of take the analogy and say, if you want to kill afly, you can kill a fly with a thermal nuclear weapon, with a MOAB, with a cruise missile, with a machinegun or a flyswatter. So the end result is the same, but the difficulty is considerably more significant fromone to the other, and the collateral damage is considerably more significant. So having that -- havingproduction be really fundamental to the design of the Model 3, I think, is very important. And making surewe're not adding extraneous features to the 3 that aren't necessary to achieve the production volume isalso extremely important. I'm not going to -- at the risk of this being misinterpreted, and probably therewill be some number of articles that do, I think it's worth explaining sort of how manufacturing a complexobject with several thousand unique components actually works and what dates are relevant. And it's --what -- in order to achieve volume production of a car -- a new car with several thousand unique items,you actually have to set a target date internally and with suppliers that is quite aggressive.","Elon Musk: With Model 3, we're beingincredibly rigorous about ensuring that we don't have anything that isn't really necessary to make a verycompelling version 1 of the car.

2016/5/4,"And that isa date that is taken -- that has to be taken seriously. So like, the date -- because I'm sure this will leak.It's hard to keep a secret, really. The date we are setting with suppliers to get to a volume productioncapability with the Model 3 is July 1 next year. Now will we actually be able to achieve volume productionon July 1 next year? Of course not. The reason is that even if 99% of the internally produced items andsupplier items are available on July 1, we still cannot produce the car, because you cannot produce a carthat is missing 1% of its components. Nonetheless, we need to work internally and with suppliers to takethat date seriously, and they need to see some penalties for anyone, internally or externally, who does notmeet that time frame. The -- that -- this is just -- this has to be the case because there's just no way thatyou have several thousand components, all of whom make it on a particular date. So the reality is that thevolume production will then be some number of months later as we solve the supply chain and internalproduction issues. But it is a bit of a confusing thing, and it is -- it does create some churn, becausepeople are like, ""Well, what's the real date?"" It's like you have to take the July 1 date seriously in order forsome date a few months later or some number of months later to actually be the real date. So yes, that'sactually how it has to work. So in order for us to be confident of achieving volume production of Model 3by late 2017, we actually have to set a date of mid-2017 and really hold people's feet to the fire internallyand externally to achieve an actual volume production date of late 2017. So as a rough guess, I would saywe would aim to produce 100,000 to 200,000 Model 3s in second half of next year. That's my expectationright now. Yes, so that's the thing. And now, what I would say to anyone that is thinking about ordering aModel 3, now is a good time to actually place your reservation or place your order because you don't haveto worry about if you're placing your order and receiving it 5 years from now. If you place your order now,there's a high probability you will actually receive your car in 2018.","The date we are setting with suppliers to get to a volume productioncapability with the Model 3 is July 1 next year.

What gives you theconfidence of the 500,000? That's a pretty amazing jump into next year. What kind of gives that convictionthat is going to be possible by 20?Elon R.

And there's -- we'readding world-class aces in production with each passing week. It is a huge advantage to have the most --I mean, what -- I think it's better to say it's probably the most compelling product program in the worldwith the Model 3. I'm not sure what would be more compelling -- at least, I think that there's a goodargument that Model 3 is the most compelling program on earth, so -- from a manufacturing standpoint.So I believe to recruit top manufacturing talents to the most compelling product on earth is very strong.We find the response to be extremely good when we call people up. So based on the rate at which we'readding world-class manufacturing expertise and some of the things that I know we're going to announcein the future, I feel highly confident that Model 3 is going to be well executed as a program. And yes,that's -- you wanted to add something, J.B.?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. If I might just add, I mean, you've mentioned this briefly before, but the design of the vehicle lendsitself to high-volume production very efficiently. And I think that's really...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, designed for manufacturing.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerAbsolutely. And that's something we're doing even today. Those designs are firming up. So this issomething happening far, far ahead of time. And the second point would be the quality and the motivationof the suppliers involved in the program is best ever.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, it's massively increased, yes. I mean, every supplier wants to be in this program.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionGot it. And if I could just ask a follow-up, I mean, obviously, cost is going to be an important factor whenthe 3 launches.

2016/5/4,"Our next question comes from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer.Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionAs you look at this accelerated plan for production, what can we expect on OpEx spending to support all ofthose cars coming out a lot faster than you had previously expected?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, this is Jason. I think we updated our guidance on OpEx for the year a little bit in the letter. We hadtalked about 20% last year and moving that range to 20% to 25% for 2016. So there's obviously going toneed to be more OpEx at this. However, at the same time, you see how we improved quarter-over-quarterin terms of OpEx. We were down $12 million from Q4, down 3%.

We hadtalked about 20% last year and moving that range to 20% to 25% for 2016. We were down $12 million from Q4, down 3%. So there's a renewed focus in the hallshere at Tesla on making sure we are managing costs extremely effectively. And all of our employees getthat and are contributing to that. And then Elon, what do you need to see to move your desk out of the factory? It's a kind of adramatic thing to talk about.",,
2016/5/4,"Our next question comes from Pat Archambault from Goldman Sachs.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionJust -- so getting back to the capital requirement for the expanded Model 3 production, appreciate theguidance that you've provided for this year from a CapEx perspective, that's helpful. But I don't know,maybe this is a question for Jason. I mean, have you guys -- can you share with us maybe what a totalcapital cost estimate might look like for the Model 3 program now that you've got a handle on what yourvolume's going to be, or what you want to produce to?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, a couple of things there. So one, we've provided some breadcrumbs, like we updated our CapExguidance to -- we had guided at $1.5 billion last quarter. And we think it'll probably be 50% higher thanthat for 2016 -- into 2017.Unknown Executive$1.5 billion.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerWhat?Unknown Executive$1.5 billion.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial Officer$1.5 billion. And into 2017. We're not going to talk about that right now. But the other thing to payattention to is our CapEx for this quarter was $216 million, which was a 47% decrease over Q4. A little bitof that is what we talked about last quarter, where a lot of the big investments from Model X had alreadybeen made. But also, we're just really focusing, as Elon has said, on capital efficiency and making surethat we are investing in the highest and best uses of cash. And I think those principles are what's going toguide the Model 3 program.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionYes, I mean, look, that's a good starting point to work with for us. I mean, we appreciate the update forthis year. Maybe the way to take the question is just kind of understand when the peak spending periodsare going to be. And if you're launching through middle of next year, is it kind of a good idea to maybeextend the amount of capital you see spending kind of in the balance of the 3 [ph] quarters through thesecond half of next year? And then clearly, with the launch, that tapers off. Is that a right way to thinkabout it? And then second to that, I would probably ask the same question just on the R&D front. When dothose costs spike in the timeframe of that program?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure, I think you're thinking about it the right way, the way you've laid it out.","Our CapEx for this quarter was $216 million, which was a 47% decrease over Q4.

2016/5/4,"And you can kind of useModel X and Model S and the ramp of capital for those programs as a way to think about Model 3. On theR&D piece of it, that is a big driver behind our updating of our range to 20% to 25% OpEx in 2016. Sowe'll start to see a little bit of that in the second half of this year. And then certainly, some more into thefirst half of 2017.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionGot it. If I can squeeze in one last one, just on the sourcing. Is this changing your strategy of workingwith suppliers? I mean, you've done a lot in-house for all your products so far, but obviously, this is avery different kind of volume number you're talking about. So are you thinking about changing the levelof vertical integration? And how does that work into sort of the ongoing capital requirements for thisprogram?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectNo. I think we're actually going to increase the amount of vertical integration that we have. I think it'svery important for us to have the ability to produce almost any part on the car at will, because it alleviatesrisk with suppliers, where -- going back to like, where if 2% of supply is not ready, we can't make the car.Having the ability internally to adapt and make those -- that 2% of parts internally is a -- really massivelyreduces risks associated with the production ramp. That, I think, is a very important thing. Now once --like, if we get to a steady state and we talk to a supplier and they can do a very efficient job of makingthat part, we have no problem transitioning it from in-sourced to outsourced. I've always -- not to in-source for the sake of in-sourcing, but rather to in-source if we think that it has meaningful improvementon schedule or cost or quality. And I mean, one of the challenges we face is that for a lot of the supplychain, they are impedance matched to the timeframe for the big OEMs. And Tesla just moves a lot fasterthan the big OEMs. And so if they're impedance matched to a typical sort of 10 -- sorry, sort of -- call itlike a 6-year development cycle and we're on a 2- or 3-year development cycle, it just doesn't -- couldn'tconnect properly. Some suppliers can handle that, and some can't.","R&D piece of it, that is a big driver behind our updating of our range to 20% to 25% OpEx in 2016.

2016/5/4,"Our next question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionI just want to talk a little bit about maybe some of the milestones that you see in terms of this accelerateddevelopment and launch of the -- or scale-up of the Model 3. First, it looked like in the proxy that theAlpha prototype was completed as of -- when it was filed a few weeks ago. So a few questions. One,when do you kind of expect the Beta prototype to be achieved? When do you think you'll have firm specsfor both your internal parts operations and for your external suppliers? And then in terms of the capital,do you see -- 2 other questions. Kind of when would you see raising capital, if at all, to meet this? Andthen finally, given the volume of trade-off decisions you're talking about making between manufacturing,design, engineering, do you see any role for a COO-type similar to what you have at SpaceX to accomplishthis timeline?Elon R.

Andin fact, the prototype that was driving at the Model 3 event the end of March was actually using theproduction drivetrain. So I think we feel pretty good about engineering completion of the last itemsprobably within 6 to 8 weeks, thereabouts. The -- so the -- and -- so with -- sort of completing the finalrelease for tooling no later than the end of June. That sort of leaves roughly 9 months for the tools tobe manufactured, which, I think, is an achievable timeframe. It's gets [ph] some suppliers, but it's anachievable timeframe. I mean, you can have a -- you can create a human baby in 9 months. I think youcan pretty much make a tool in 9 months. So that's our expectations. So then, we want to have parts offproduction tooling starting in April next year. So we've got 3 months of validation for a normal start ofvolume production in July. Again, it's a nominal start, and it's a date that we internally take seriously, andthat suppliers need to take seriously. But it is one where inevitably, there will be some small number ofitems that cause slippage that -- such that the actual date of reaching volume production is some numberof months after that.","Elon R.

2016/5/4,"Our next question comes from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionElon, so on our math, your combined fleet of Model S and X are driving more than 3 million miles a day.So in just one day, your cars do about 2x the distance that Google's done in the entire history of theirself-driving car project. Now while your cars aren't exactly sensor-encrusted Christmas trees with tensof thousands of dollars of equipment, like a retrofitted Google car, it's still a lot of miles.

I mean, I think, really -- and particularly, as you go to, say, kind of -- in the long-term, kind of fully autonomous driving which, I think, is going to -- that's going to require quite a lot ofregulatory oversight.

2016/5/4,"Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionWe can all now see, with the Model 3 preorders, that you are entirely correct that there is tons of demandfor the car, just like you've been saying all along. So I think about a month ago, when you startedtweeting those preorders, right, the investor and parts supplier confidence in your ability to ramp to 0.5million units rightfully skyrocketed. With that said, from a supply perspective, you have sometimes haddifficulty in achieving delivery targets because of the issues in smoothly increasing capacity in assembly,and you've shown a strong preference for emphasizing quality over quantity. So is there anything that'schanged on the supply side of the equation that should also be confidence instilling maybe, I don't know,lessons learned from the launch of X or some other factor that should give confidence in your ability to beat a 200,000 to 400,000 unit annual run rate of Model 3 production approximately 14 months from now?Elon R.

However, it is a date we need to hold ourselves to internally and we need to holdsuppliers to. But it is an impossible date because there's 6,000, 7,000 unique components in the Model 3,and it -- and that would assume that all of them arrive on time.

So I mean, I feel confident that we're going to hit like the 2000-vehicle-a-week target by the end ofthis quarter, of which, on the order of 40% are X. I'm just telling you, that's our internal plan and what weexpect to meet. There's no question, the X is a very difficult car to manufacture. I think it's unquestionablyactually the most difficult car to manufacture in the world. And Bob Lutz would agree with that. I thinkhe said something to the effect that he thought it wasn't manufacturable or something that. It's certainlymanufacturable, it's just a hard thing to fill [ph] for. So I mean, we have some internal milestones that Ithink are -- that we've achieved thus far that I'm pretty excited about. Friday, at 3, we've achieved ourfirst flawless production of a Model X, where it went through the whole production process and had 0issues. That was a great milestone, and we were kind of celebrating at 2 or 3 a.m. Friday, it was great.And then -- and now we're starting to get several in a row that are flawless. And so it's really gainingmomentum very quickly. We feel pretty good about the trajectory of S and X. As for convincing all thenaysayers, I think that will basically be never. There's always going to be naysayers. And I'd just say like,what I find ironic about a lot of the naysayers is that they -- the very same people will transition fromsaying it was impossible to saying it was obvious.","Elon Musk: I feel confident that we're going to hit like the 2000-vehicle-a-week target by the end ofthis quarter, of which, on the order of 40% are X.

2016/5/4,"Our next question comes from Phil LeBeau of CNBC.Phil LebeauElon, I have a question. It was about 10 minutes ago, you made a reference to 1 million vehicles in 2020.Is that a production target, a production goal, or a hypothetical? I'm just looking for some clarificationthere.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI mean, that's my best guess. If we're 0.5 million in 2018, and then sort of roughly 50%-ish growth fromthere, then, it's probably around 1 million in 2020.Phil LebeauAnd do you not have an estimate as to how many production plants you will need in order to make thathappen?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, we -- I think it is actually feasible. Maybe not advisable, but feasible to do it with just Fremont andthe Gigafactory. We actually believe that Fremont and the Gigafactory could scale to 1 million vehicles.Whether that's actually wise is a separate question. And as I said earlier, it's going to make sense todo localized production, at least on a continent basis. Otherwise, your logistics cost end up being quiteextreme. Or they start -- your logistics cost start becoming a bigger and bigger percentage of the totalvehicle cost. I mean, that's really why manufacturers build their cars for a local market. They build carsfor a market in that market because the logistics cost associated with shipping a 1.5- to 2-ton vehicle aremassively greater than, say, shipping a little consumer electronics device.","Elon R.

2016/8/3,"So Jason, over to you.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, everybody for joining. I just want to make a few brief comments to add alittle bit more color to the shareholder later.We're clearly disappointed with our delivery numbers but there's some underlying stories that we feelreally good about, and I want to walk you through those. Automotive gross margin expanded this quarter.Automotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits grew from 20.1% in Q1 to 21.2% in Q2. A couple ofdifferent factors here. One was the Model S refresh. There was a modest price increase on the refresh butmore importantly, we had baked the number of cost-downs into that vehicle before the launch. And thenthe second big factor is obviously X production. We've talked a lot about how we have come through thestruggles on that and how we've managed to climb that production ramp, so that's looking great.On a go-forward basis, the way we're thinking about margins is we certainly see opportunities forcontinued cost-downs, both on the engineering front, also on the commercial front as well. We've gota supplier base that is very excited about the Model 3, and it's giving us the ability to leverage that,included for cost-downs and also continue manufacturing efficiencies. As we mentioned in the shareholderletter, labor hours per car is trending quite Positively right now and we're laser focused on continuedimprovement in that key metric.Next, talk about the cash position for a second. Here's one way to think about it. We ended up with $3.25billion on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. We started off the year, in December 31, 2015,we had $1.2 billion. We raised $1.7 billion in our secondary offering and we collected on our Model 3reservations. Therefore, we are in a very healthy position from a cash perspective.A couple of different factors here to talk about. One, we've got $678 million drawn on our asset-backedline. This is something that we've talked about in the past. That is definitely backed up by our operations.Two things there. One, approximately 5,000 cars in transit to customers at quarter end. We're financingour FGI. And we're monetizing our direct lease portfolio.Second factor on the cash position that we'd like to highlight is our continued CapEx discipline. As wetalked about in Q1, we had $217 million of CapEx in that quarter. In this quarter, $295 million of CapEx.We compare that to averaging nearly $400 million a quarter throughout 2015.","Automotive gross margin, excluding ZEV credits grew from 20.1% in Q1 to 21.2% inQ2.

2016/8/3,"We're actually very pleasedwith these results and we're comfortable that we aren't doing anything to adversely impact our future. Ona go-forward basis, thinking about CapEx efficiency, you've heard Elon talk a lot about that machine thatmakes the machine. A big part of that is focusing on volumetric efficiency. In our call on Monday, I talkedabout how when we started to review a lot of the Model 3 CapEx plans across the company, there were abunch of new buildings everywhere. And the reaction to that was: wait a second, we've actually got a nicefacilities footprint already, and how can we just amplify those facilities and not have to invest further inthis area? And we're starting to see a lot of that take hold now.Second, I think we're making an attempt to crush the conventional wisdom that capacity increases onlyhappen in step-change increments and the capital that follows that in step-change increments as well. Andto put a little bit more color on that, there are many ways to optimize our current operations. The way tothink about this is we can just drive greater throughput through the same investments. So that's our cashposition.Finally, I'd just like to talk for a minute about expense management. In addition to our efforts on CapExefficiency, we're also very focused on OpEx discipline. This quarter, SG&A would have been flat quarter-over-quarter in spite of our continued expansion in service and sales, were it not for the payroll taxes wepaid on our CEO's options exercises. SG&A was up $19 million quarter-over-quarter on a non-GAAP basis.$17 million of that was the payroll expense associated with those option exercises.R&D now does continue to increase as we continue to march towards the Model 3 launch and continue toinvest in our future. This is as predicted and as we've signaled in the past.So to wrap it all up, we're very happy with the gross margin expansion in the quarter and we haveincreased our emphasis on OpEx discipline and CapEx efficiency. We believe our Q2 results reflect that andwe're not backing down as we move forward.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsGreat. Thank you, Jason. All right, Latif, let's go to the first question, please.","R&D now does continue to increase as we continue to march towards the Model 3 launch and continue toinvest in our future.

2016/8/3,"Our first question comes from Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley.Neel MehtaMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionI'm going to ask this question on behalf of Adam Jonas. He had to drop off the call. This is Neel Mehta.This is coming directly from him. You have explained -- Elon, you've explained the strategic rationale forhaving SolarCity and Tesla Motors join in a combined company. When we think of SpaceX, is there anyconceivable strategic rationale for Tesla Motors and Tesla Energy or Tesla Solar to work closely with theefforts of space exploration? And when we're thinking about this, we're thinking proprietary lower at theorbit satellite network to enhance the connected autonomous car ecosystem. And so yes, I just want toget your thoughts on that, first of all, and I have a follow-up as well.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I don't think there's a strong park rationale to combine SpaceX and Tesla, whereas there is for Teslaand SolarCity. It's really quite tenuous for SpaceX and Tesla.

And can you also give us update us on your -- on Tesla's proprietary mapping initiatives?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderNo, I think we would -- we should -- we prefer it be confidential in that regard. What we've said thus faris just that we're -- there's a need to have much higher-definition maps than currently existing around theworld in order to have full autonomy.

2016/8/3,"Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionA couple of questions very much tied to cash flow and the borrowing capacity. First is just aroundcustomer deposits which were a source of cash in the quarter but looked to be about $288 million. As ofMay, you had 373-ish (sic) [373,000-ish] Model S -- Model 3 preorders which would imply about a $375million inflow [indiscernible]. Could you maybe walk us between that number and what the actual changein deposits were? And in particular, where did Model 3 preorders end the quarter at?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. So in terms of thinking about the cash flow, yes, you're doing your math correctly, but we alsorelease deposits when we deliver cars, so there's an inflow and there is an outflow there. And we had --the deposits on the early Model X cars were larger than the later Model X cars as well, so that's one of theimpacts there as well. In terms of the Model 3 reservations, the 373,000 number that you reference iswhat we talked about when we did our secondary offering, and we're sticking to that number in terms ofdisclosure.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. Second question around the shift from increased on-balance sheet captive lending. My quickcalculations, if you go up 8% in the back half off of your 50k guide, that seems to be, at 100k, about a$350 million cash need. And merely you're paying [ph] -- actually would be less with the cost of goodssold, call, $250 million, $280 million. Are you going to finance that out of your ABL? How quickly can youget another lease partner? And what do the amendments to the credit agreement for SolarCity kind of doto your ability to borrow against that for this captive financing?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. So in terms of -- the ABL is definitely available for some of that for sure. And then the overallliquidity position gives us confidence that we'll be able to do this. At the same time, we do have a lot --many active discussions going on with other lease partners and we're looking at other ways to do this aswell. And I don't want to talk a lot about SolarCity on this call. That's not what it is, but they've got somepretty advanced capability in thinking through how to walk through this as well.","A couple of questions very much tied to cash flow and the borrowing capacity.

2016/8/3,"Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Anderson of Dougherty & Company.Charles Lowell AndersonDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionMy first question is around the sharing of vehicles described in the updated master plan. So if we'removing from 5% to 10% utilization of the vehicle to some larger number, I wonder what you think theramifications of that might be on the number of cars that need to be produced every year. And thenmaybe, the ramifications as it relates to the supercharger of the cars or the supercharger network, if thecars are always driving around? And then I have a follow-up.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, I think that the demand for autonomous cars will pass that way to the production capability. So Imean just want to bear in mind that the global fleets of vehicles is about 2.5 billion roughly and total newvehicle production ever year is only about 100 million. So the fleet's base would be turning over everyroughly 20, 25 years. So if we -- we would have to make some truly enormous number of autonomousvehicles for there to be any demand saturation because it'll basically be the only car anyone wants to buy.Charles Lowell AndersonDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionAnd then for my second question, I wonder if you could clarify comments made on the last call aboutinverter technology. You mentioned having some of the best in the world for power electronics. So Iwonder if you could just comment if that's the case that you will be making your own inverter. And if so,what will be the benefit to the overall system with your inverter technology versus what's used today?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I think there's no question Tesla's going to do integrated inverter. Logically too, I think we've gotthe most advanced inverter engineering team in the world. And so it makes sense to just as we do theinverters on vehicles to do it with solar as well and have it in a very tight package at a cents per watt levelthat is, I think, probably twice as good as anyone else, I think maybe better than that. So that's like theobvious move there. And as part of what I was referring to is kind of an integrated product. I mean, ifyou're -- if you put yourself in the consumer's shoes, you just want it to work. You don't want to know howit works, what you -- you don't care about the details.","Elon R.

2016/8/3,"But, Imean, I think in sort of a nutshell, the way to think about Tesla right now is that we're right around 2,000cars a week, and we try to balance the mix to be about roughly half X and S. There are some variationsdepending upon regionality. Some parts of the world prefer more SUVs; some prefer more sedans. And wedo tend to batch up our cars, so this is why occasionally you see nonsensical articles about Tesla's demandsuddenly rising in some country or suddenly falling. It's got nothing to do with that; it's just happened tobe when the ship arrived. But high-level overview is just we see demand being fairly strong at an averageof 2,000 cars a week, and we are able to maintain production at that level, notwithstanding occasionalsupplier hiccups. And then hopefully, we can grow that a little bit towards the end of the quarter and thena little more in Q4. And our aspiration, this unvarnished here [ph], this is just what we're aiming to dointernally, is to do a little better than 2,000 a week in sales and deliveries in Q4, combined S and X. I feelfairly optimistic about achieving that goal. Yes, I think our core business is actually doing quite well rightnow.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionJust as a follow-up, any update on stationary storage? I think your original target for 400 million to 500million for this year and 2 million to 5 million for next year. Any just color on how that's trending.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderHeavily enduring production constraints. There were -- we've got some next-generation technologyand we've got to school [ph] up that production line. So it's going to be heavily concentrated in Q4 andprobably even heavily in November and December, but it's -- I think it's going to be really exciting whenpeople see it. So that's why I expect kind of exponential growth from there. I think it's really going to goballistic.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, and we have been making quite a few background investments in the markets where we're growing,setting up the teams and setting up to get ready for expanded product installation and distribution,especially in places like Australia and in Germany. So some of that takes a bit of time but it's laying theinfrastructure for faster growth.","Elon R.

2016/8/3,"Our next question comes from John Murphy of Bank of America.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionJust the first question is as we think about the 60 kilowatt hour versions of the S and X, I'm just curiousif you could talk about the profitability of those right now versus the other models or sort of the corporateaverage as you see it.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure, so -- go ahead, Elon.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. So I was going to say, because people are optioning up the 60, it actually ends up being decent. Imean, it's not -- I mean, maybe it's sort of like 15% to 20% gross margin, whereas say, something like ifsomebody orders the performance dual motor, that might actually be more like a 30%, 35% gross margin.But there's just a small number of people that want high-performance cars and are willing to pay tripledigits or 6 more -- 6 digits, I should say, so -- but there also remains to be seen how many who orderthe 60 then choose to do the upgrade to the 75 kilowatt hour rate. So there's going to be some number,it's too early to tell, of people who buy it at 60, realize they want the extra range, and then they canjust order a kind of like an in-app purchase on the car's screen and unlock it. I suspect we'll see a prettydecent number of people do that but we don't -- it's still very early. So it's hard to say what number thatwould be. And if they do, do that, then it will push gross margins up into the 20s, like in the mid-20s orsomething.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionOkay, that's helpful. And then just, Jason, maybe just 2 quick sort of housekeeping questions. CapEx,the $2.25 billion, you're running a run rate that's less than half that for the first half of the year. Sojust curious how realistic that number is for the full year because you guys have committed to it in theshareholder letter again. And then also, the auto gross margin going up 200 to 300 basis points off ofwhat base? I'm just -- it's not clear what base that's coming off of. I'm just trying to understand the exitgross margin for the year you're expecting.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure. No problem.

2016/8/3,"Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets.Joseph Robert SpakRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research DivisionJason, just first question to follow up on that last one. So even 2 or 3 points on gross margin sequentially,that seems below the prior guidance which you then called for 30% to exit the year on the Model S and25% on the Model X. So is it related to the updated mix view on the 60? Was there something else goingon? Or what's the source of the change?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes. No, a couple of things there. And our previous guidance had been approaching 25% on X andapproaching 30% on S. So I think we're maybe a quarter or 2 off on that, but you're pointing to theright things. One is just the mix shift that we're seeing with more Xs being produced. Those margins arehealthy and heading in the right direction, but they're obviously less than S. And now that we're halfwaythrough the year too, we've talked a lot about just the production issues we've had overall. And thosecertainly had an impact on the first half of the year and it's just difficult to make up for all of that in thenext 6 months. And then the impact, you talk about the 60s.

I've heard and we saw obviously in the second quarter, there wassome lumpiness in the production and you ended up I think, with 50, 100-or-so vehicles in transit atthe end of the quarter. And I've heard Elon or Jason say stable or stabilization here a few times in thecall. Just want to get a sense for how we should be thinking about the back half deliveries and back halfexpenses. Should it be relatively linear from here as we work toward, for example, your 30% year-over-year expense guidance?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, I mean -- sorry, so I'll just start, say a few words and then Jason can address them. I mean basically,we were in production hell for the first 6 months of this year. I mean, mean, it was hell. And then wejust managed to sort of climb out of hell or -- in like basically part way through June and now we're --the production line is humming. And our suppliers mostly have their sh*t together. There's a few thatdon't. One of them, I know you're visiting on Saturday personally to figure out what the hell is going onthere, but we'll solve it. But I mean just like -- the thing that's crazy hard about cars is that there's severalthousand unique items and you move as fast as the slowest item in the whole car. So yes, but that said,like production is like -- it feels like we're -- I'm not losing sleep at night literally because of the productionissues right now. 2,000 feels like a good number. That was like a slow steady increase in that number. Andthen continue the cost efficiencies which help with gross margin. Some features that are going to comeout, that will also help on the revenue side. And so I feel like actually really good about S and X right now.But I get some -- a whole lot of mental scar tissue from the first 6 months this year. Jason?Jason S.

Can you talk a little bit about the businesspipeline, what's the mix of customers you're selling the product to? And is there a significant contingentof solar? And I wasn't clear on -- there was an earlier question on whether the business is still tracking toaround 500 million this year. Could you just elaborate on that business line?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. It's heavily dependent on the production ramp in the last few months of the year. So the -- like,there's definitely nothing even remotely close to demand constraints on the Tesla Energy side. It's entirelygetting the insuring done and getting it validated, getting your all [ph] certification, scaling up all elementsof the supply chain, and being able to produce in volume. So the reason it's tricky to predict is becausethe volume ramp looks an exponential. And so if you move the dates around even a little bit, it can quitesignificantly change what occurs in a quarter just because the production ramp is an exponential andshifts up a couple of weeks. It can make the quarter look low but actually, it's in vertical climb mode, sothe following quarter will look amazing.

I guess, just an accounting question maybe for Jason. With the residual value guarantee goingaway, what happens to the accounting for revenues? Do you kind of get to something more close to whatwe see in other OEM financials and maybe just have the portion that's direct lease be accounted for asleases? And what would be the timing of changes assuming they do have them?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes. No, absolutely, and the answer to timing, it changes right away. So a car that is sold without in -- sowith an RVG, that drops us into lease accounting. And what we've done historically and we'll continue todo for RVGs is we recognize the full revenue on a non-GAAP basis.

WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYou'll see that but the other thing I want to point you to is what we've already talked about and probablyan uptake in direct leasing. When we have used a partner in the past for leasing, that gives us non-GAAPrevenue recognition on that. Our non-GAAP revenue recognition is very simple, we follow the cash. Ifsomebody pays us for -- pays us cash for a car, we recognize it in non-GAAP revenue. When we do directleasing, then that drops us in to pure lease accounting so there, it will be that way on a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionAnd I mean, is the 8 to 15, is that just kind of a temporary measure while you're setting up these newpartner relationships? Or do you actually expect to stay at 15 for some time?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSo 15 is what we're talking about for Q3 and I think I mentioned earlier, we've got a bunch of activeconversations with new partners. There's another factor too which is I think, important to point out. We'veintroduced some pretty compelling loan programs, particularly in North America in the last 90 days.

Does some of that unwind? Were there any changes tohigher terms in the quarter? Or is that just this thing with the ramp in production?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure, yes. Great questions, Jason. So yes, there was definitely an increase in payables and I think that willstart to unwind a little bit in Q4, although this is natural. If you look at production, I believe it increased37% quarter-over-quarter so there's naturally going to be more parts coming into the factory. So I thinksome of that is just in the course of business. And the other thing that I think is worth pointing out on thecash flow statement is receivables.

We ended up with a fairly large receivable balance on carsthat were delivered in the last 10 days or so.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, definitely. Also yes, with emphasizing that, I mean, it's the first approximation you expect, payablesto increase by 37% if you -- production does -- and then you have to net out against receivables.

MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, in fact -- yes, thanks for making that point, Jason. I think it's worth emphasizing that for Model 3, butthe Model 3 system is designed -- the whole manufacturing supply chain system is designed so that thefaster Model 3 production grows, the faster Tesla's cash balance grows. So the terms that we're gettingfrom suppliers are significantly better, almost 60 days, as compared to about 40 to 45 days for S and X.And the Model 3 production and logistics is way faster, so the car spends much less time in the factoryand we're working on ways to expedite delivery of the vehicles to suit the end customer, which we cando when we have scale.","Elon R.

A couple of things. First, clearly with your deliverynumbers, the California and the other CARB states are buying more Teslas. Yet last quarter, you talkedabout the value of those plummeting and we shouldn't really expect much. So kind of, obviously, you'regenerating more but a couple of questions. What's happened in the marketplace for those credits? AndI know even under GAAP, you don't list that as a balance sheet asset, but if we were to think about thequarterly generation of credits as well as the credits on your -- in effect in your car bank that could bemonetized in the future, how would we think about those?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderUnfortunately, as I said on record before, the CARB, their credit mandate is incredibly weak and needs tobe fixed. And when you have a weak mandate, obviously, the value of those credits decline conservatively.There are some quarters where we simply cannot even find a buyer for credit. And then when we can finda buyer, it's typically $0.50 on the $1 for those who have credit. So -- and then obviously, their creditonly applied to, what, roughly half of our market in the U.S., maybe slightly above half, and it doesn'tapply to Asia or Europe or Canada or Mexico or anywhere else. So it's there. It's -- I think CARB reallyshould be doing more. It's unfortunate that they're not. And then I need to sort of move right along ablog piece that's sort of going through this. But that Tesla's sometimes criticized for relying on tax creditsand that kind of thing. People really misunderstand this. What matters is what does Tesla receive relativeto its competitors, not what -- that we receive in the absolute. For our competitors, it may be worthnoting, maybe you would consider us to be a risk or something that is problematic for us. Our competitorsmonetize ZEV credits at 100 cents on the dollar. We monetize them at 50 cents on the dollar where wecould get it. That means if you have, let's say, -- I mean it depends on the scenario, but if you have, let'ssay, 3 ZEV credits for an EV that would essentially be worth $5,000 each, so that would be $15,000.

We hadcapacitized the factory and had the factory to actually produce much more -- many more cars in the firsthalf of the year and we fell short of that. And now we're at the rate that we had planned to be at early inthe year. So our absorption is about where we'd expect it to be. And I think what you're seeing now froman absorption perspective as it's related to gross margin is a good steady state rate.Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionOkay, I was just looking for a quarter-over-quarter number in terms of the contribution margin.Jason S.","A quarter ago, you were guiding to roughly 80,000vehicles. A year and now 3 months later, we're down at 75,000. Can you just walk us through the factorsthat are impacting that lower shipment number, or delivery number, I should say. And then the second question for me is really about absorption. Withnearly 40% increase in deliveries, can you guys break out the impact in gross margin to absorption? Itwould seem that, that would be a meaningful number at this point. And our next question comes from the line from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer.",,

Or is it more that you're on schedule with thoseactivities but doing them in a thriftier way or some sort of combination of these factors?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderOne of the things that what we've found is way better with the 3 program than X and S is that ourequipment suppliers are willing to work with us on payment terms and we're being able to back-end load.And in fact, post-production load, a huge amount of the CapEx.

There was some changed language in there from Tesla's currently planning to raise additional fundsby the end of the year to you're now stating that you expect adequate liquidity through at least the end ofthe year, I think it says.

Our current plan, our current financial plan does not require any capital raisefor Model 3 at all. So now that's different from saying whether we should raise capital or not to accountfor uncertainty, to have a larger buffer and to sort of derisk the business.

Can you talk any more about that? And then maybein the same question, how I saw this, the slide deck yesterday about how their business model is changingfrom lease to more cash sales or loan sales.

As always, I really want to remind people thatcar is -- consists of several thousand unique items. We can only go as fast as the first item, and so whatwe're trying to do in advance of -- through production is to increase the scope of Tesla's internal capabilityso that we're internally capable of making almost anything and kind of like reserve troops. You don't knowexactly where they'll be needed, but you know it's a good idea to have them. And so that we can minimizethe degree which a single supplier can stop the entire production line.Daniel SparksOkay, great. And then as Model S and Model X, with higher levels of sales recently, higher levels ofdeliveries and as Model 3 approaches, do you feel confident in these levels as Model 3 approaches? Iknow that we haven't talked too much about 2017, but just kind of speaking as far as trajectory for thosedeliveries go and how we could think about it.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I mean, another thing I want to emphasize is when you -- the production ramp tends to look like a-- is exponential or ultimately, it's an S-curve. Exponential goes to linear, then goes to log. And it's verydifficult to predict exactly where that beginning part of the exponential and the S curve fits in betweenquarterly reporting. A shift of even a few weeks one way or the other can have quite a dramatic effect onwhat it looks like in that quarter, but that's not indicative of the future. So we're kind of telling you what-- what we -- we're giving you the best assessment we have short of having a crystal ball.","Elon R.

It has Tesla relevance. So just bear with me.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI admire long-term thinking but impressive.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionWell, numerous reports have suggested the new administration may be in favor of accelerating a missionto send humans to Mars.

Could it potentially change therationale of keeping Tesla and SpaceX as independent companies? And this is a serious question, Elon.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderOkay. Well, yes, but when you started out, I was a little curious as to how this would become relevant toTesla. But as I said before, I expect to remain with Tesla essentially forever unless somebody kicks meout. So that remains my intention. And I've been pursuing the sort of Mars thing at SpaceX and the sameenergy at Tesla for a long time simultaneously. So I think it's going through a pretty good rhythm.

2017/2/22,"And our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionCurious as to what has changed on your end. Obviously, you've got -- made an acquisition. You've hiredthe individual in manufacturing from last year. But really moving from the Model S and X to the Model 3ramp that you're looking for in the back half of 2017 here into 2018, how have you gone about the Model3 development differently versus the Model S and Model X that will really be able to unlock the key todriving production much higher than what your previous ramps have looked like for new products?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight, the Model 3 is designed -- is really designed for manufacturing. It's considerably a simpler carthan the S or the X. Some of these -- some modifications are obvious. For example, the Model 3 onlyhas one screen, whereas the S and X have 2 screens and 2 separate computers powering each screen.The Model 3 has 1.5 kilometers of wiring. The Model S has 3 kilometers of wiring. So we simplified thewiring system considerably. The -- a lot of the bells and whistles that are present on an S and an X are notpresent on a Model 3. So we don't have self-presenting door handles, for example, or falcon wing doors.These reduce the risk substantially in a ramp and make it just easier to scale. And so I think it's goingto be a very compelling car, but it's just -- it's a simpler design. And we also understand manufacturinga lot better than we did in the past. And we're also able to get usually the A team at the A supplier forModel 3. It's really that we're now able to get that, whereas for S and -- particularly for S and to somedegree for X -- when we trying to get suppliers for Model S, a lot of the top-tier suppliers wouldn't evenwork with us, didn't believe the car, that the -- they thought we'd go bankrupt. And the -- IHS, I thinkit's called, but they're basically a predictor for -- volume of the Model S predicted -- an official predictionof 3,000 units lifetime for the Model S. And for a lot of the big supplier, particularly the large sort ofconglomerate suppliers, they just plug that number into their predictions but they ignore what we say.And then basically, the volume is either too small to count or the car cost is enormous because these fixedcosts must be allocated over such a small volume.","The Model 3 is designed -- is really designed for manufacturing.

2017/2/22,"Now in fact, we are building something in the order of50,000 Model Ss per year. And so having shown the results of the S and the X, the interest from suppliers,you went from basically getting like the worst team on second-tier suppliers to getting the best team onfirst-tier suppliers, really a big difference.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionYes, okay. And then just following up on that as I think about reduced complexity of the vehicle,understood. From an actual line speed manufacturing perspective for the Model 3, what are you doingdifferently with the manufacturing process that is going to allow you to drive that ramp in production?So think about 50,000 units, Model S, on an annual basis, it's good. It's great. You've been making thatvehicle for the last 3, 4 years.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight, as opposed to -- I mean, for -- yes, an annualized rate of 250,000. 5x that number for Model 3 is areasonable question to ask. The -- there's just a lot more automation than there is for S and X. We havethe Gigafactory, of course. That's a huge asset for factory, powertrain, power electronics, chargers and afew other things. So that's a huge asset and yes -- so -- but also we focused most of Tesla engineering,including design engineering, into designing the factory. The -- I think in the future, the factory willbe a more important product than the car itself. I've said this before but we're -- our goal is to be thebest manufacturer on earth. This is a real goal. I don't know if we'll succeed, but I think we're makinggood progress in that direction. And that's -- yes, it's really -- when you think of the factory, it's just anenormous product with at least [indiscernible] more complex than whatever it makes. J.B., anything youwant to add?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, I might just add that we really learned a lot of lessons, especially from the difficult Model X ramp.That's something that's in our recent memory, and we fought through it and succeeded. But I think inthe design of the Model 3 and the system and the lines that produce it, many of those learnings havebeen incorporated from the beginning. So the amount of complexity in the operations to assemble the caris dramatically reduced. The amount of operations involved some level of sort of assembly craft, wherethere's more judgment of the operator.","Elon Musk: We are building something in the order of50,000 Model Ss per year.

2017/2/22,"It's dramatically reduced, almost eliminated. And a lot of thesethings that we could identify directly as the bottlenecks that hurt us on the X ramp, we've been able totarget specifically and reduce or eliminate. So that has -- though painful, it was a very helpful experiencefor us to get ready for Model 3.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Now I do want to emphasize with production ramps in general that -- they call it an S curve. So therate of production is as fast as the slowest component in the vehicle. And when you have several thousandunique items, the -- it can be as fast as the least likely and worst executing part of Tesla or our suppliers,but that's just the way it goes. So it's -- you're going through a series of constraints. You try to anticipateas many as possible. There are new issues that pop up every week. And then we attack them and getthem to solve for schedule. And then another issue will pop up in the following week. So it's schedulewhack-a-mole. And if we knew what would be late now, we would obviously attack it, but some of thesethings only come to light late in the game. And when you have a global supply chain, you inherit a lot offorce majeure risk from around the world. It's just one of the things that I think we want to do is minimizeforce majeure risk. This is -- if you inherit like every force majeure risk on the earth, then of course,things are going to go wrong because earth is big. So I think we're going to, increasingly over time,rationalize our supply chain to minimize the force majeure risk. It's very important, but yes, the -- it'salways tricky being a public company and reporting on a quarterly basis. Even small differences in wherethat exponential part of the S curve is can make quite a big impact on the quarter because [indiscernible]imagine datelines moving around an exponential curve. Just small changes here and there have quite abig effect. And then things get more predictable as you get to the flat part of the S curve, the top of the Scurve. That's why it's a lot easier to predict, to say what things would be next year or the end of this yearas opposed to what they'd be month by month this year.","The rate of production is as fast as the slowest component in the vehicle.

Can you talk about what delayed the software updates into 1Q? Was it a switchfrom Mobileye in any way? And then talk about how the current capabilities of Autopilot in 1Q in terms ofperformance and safety, how that's better than maybe what was offered previously.Elon R.

Wheeler: I think the way we're thinking about that is there's going to be pretty higher bars on -- withthe deliveries only for Model 3 in the second half of the year. So we didn't want to muddy our guidance by doing some kind of a combinednumber. And obviously, execution on X and S is what's important. And those are the things that we really want to point investors to andhow we're measuring ourselves. And then will -- I guess just to follow on that, I was wondering if you guys would be willing to indicatewhen you think configuration for the 3 would open. But separately also, Elon, there's been a lot of newsor noise around unionization at Fremont. And if it did occur, sort of how that changes the cost structure?",,

But that [indiscernible] matters over the last fewmonths. Tesla's injury rate is less than half of the industry average contrary to the allegations made.

2017/2/22,"And our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.Aileen SmithThis is Aileen Smith on for John. First in a more high-level question, I realize it's still very early days interms of the new Trump administration, but with Scott Pruitt now head of the EPA, are you anticipatingany changes with respect to the oversight or regulations under CARB and its relationship to the EPA? Elon,is that coming up in your meetings with the Trump team at all or any of the discussions? And how wouldyou respond in the event that regulations and standards or the potential to generate the credits were to bealtered?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSure. Well, it's only come up briefly. And my response is that I think it will be fine to get rid of incentivesand subsidies, but that should be uniformly applied to all industries. It would obviously be wrong to-- or to get rid of any sort of government intervention in sustainable energy while retaining it in fossilfuels. That -- if the principle is to get rid of government intervention, that should be uniformly applied,not unfairly applied. But that's the only thing -- there was no -- that was my comment, but there's noresponse given. They listened to that and that's sort of -- that's how I feel. And as I mentioned on aprior call, the reality actually is that if electric vehicle incentives went away tomorrow, Tesla's competitiveposition would improve. It's probably why GM is able to sell the Volt at the price that they are able to doit while on paper, making a loss. It's that they -- their ZEV credits are worth only twice as much as theyare for Tesla because they get the full retail value of their credits, which is worth about $10,000 more tothem than it is to Tesla. We get basically 50 cents on the dollar when we can sell ZEV credits, which isnot always. Last quarter, we were able to sell only a tiny amount of ZEV credits because that mandate isjust already really weak. So the irony of getting rid of it would actually improve our competitive position.And ZEV credits only apply to 14 states in the U.S., every 14 -- they don't apply internationally. And yes,so -- and then things like the federal tax credit for electric vehicle caps out, I think, at 300,000 cars.We're not far from that point.","Elon Musk: I think it will be fine to get rid of incentivesand subsidies, but that should be uniformly applied to all industries.

2017/2/22,"And our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionJust a few questions about the cash flow and cash CapEx and cash needs. First, I recognize that you'renow consolidating in SolarCity. But if you were just to very roughly give us what the old automotiveadjusted cash flow was and try to kind of disentangle that from the cash flow coming out of the formerSolarCity, what would that roughly look like directionally?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. So I think we put in the letter that cash generation was $70 million, about $70 million. So SolarCitywas actually a cash generator for the 5-week stub period. Some of that was the cash and the tax equitydeals closing. So the way to think about SolarCity on a go-forward basis is prioritizing cash generationsthrough preservation over the near term for that business. So I don't anticipate any significant -- it's notgoing to have a significant impact on our cash position in future quarters.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. And secondly, the $2 billion to $2.5 billion CapEx guide, that spend, does that imply that that's nota full -- couple of questions. Does that imply that's not a full year 2017 number given that productioncadence that you're planning?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerCorrect. That's between now and the start of production for Model 3.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. And second, can you talk a little bit more about the deferral of cash out for CapEx due toagreements with suppliers or some of those equipment suppliers to defer payments? Just what are thoseagreements? Where does that liability show up on the balance sheet? And then is that a hard -- as soonthey deliver a proof part, does that come due? Or how does the actual timing of that payment work?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure, absolutely. So I think this is one of the benefits of having a very successful run over the lastcouple of years. We have developed a lot of trust with our suppliers. So when I started, we asked, ""Okay,what's our average days payables outstanding?"" and it was lower than it should be. And we've been ableto renegotiate the payment terms with just about everybody and stretch out those payables. And it's nota question of just not paying. It's actually we have trust and we're going -- renegotiating lease contractswith suppliers.

2017/2/22,"And our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCI would just add my congratulations to Jason, and best of luck and then -- and welcome back to Deepak.If I may quickly, Elon, you mentioned in response to a ZEV question earlier, the 14 states, or I believeit was, that sort of share these standards and allow manufacturers to sort of earn credits, buy credits,allow you to sell credits and so forth, understanding that the extent that a competitor vehicle is sold inCalifornia, it counts toward their quota, if you will, in other states, and that the waiver that allows thatmight be expiring later this year. And I'm just wondering, number one, if that's correct, if I'm thinkingabout right way, and how that would theoretically impact your business. You've talked about how if sort ofthese $7,500 Federal -- I know I'm mixing ZEV and GHG and so forth. But you talked about how it couldtheoretically be a competitive advantage for Tesla, and I'm just wondering if you could sort of opine onthat.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, it's just that in order to scale, just to [indiscernible] a week -- it's like 1%, less than 1% or sometiny number of vehicles made in that state or sold in that state because we're the only ones who currentlymake a car in California. And I do think California maybe should do a bit more to support its onlyremaining auto manufacturer to remain competitive. The -- yes, it's weird that they need to do more tosupport non-California companies than Tesla. But it's -- this mandate becomes irrelevant at scale. Teslawill have as many more ZEV credits than the rest of the U.S. industry combined. So the value of them justdrops to a negligible number. And then they don't [indiscernible] major manufactures. They don't reallyneed to sell them either because they make whatever the puny amount of electric vehicles are, 20,000cars maybe. We're making 20x, 30x that number. So this is just -- they're just not as important at scalebecause the mandate are too weak.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCYes, understood. I was just sort of getting at the fact that maybe if the Volt sale in California doesn't counttoward New York or something that it's actually -- it's weaker.

We're deciding on [indiscernible] intervention, like we were -- we increased thedesign lifetime of the powertrain to -- from roughly 1/4 million miles to, aspirationally, 1 million miles. Sothat should really help with service and...Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionI guess just still trying to calibrate to this cash flow and cash needs. Is it -- maybe a different way to askthis is, is it reasonable to expect that you would hit for the motors company free cash flow breakeven atthe 250,000 unit a year level for Model 3, assuming what we know today?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIt depends on how quickly we want to ramp production to go from 5k a week to 10k a week of Model 3.There could be an argument that you don't want to go to cash flow breakeven or Positive because you'reessentially -- you're losing a lot of sales. And when you do -- when you calculate the present value ofthese cash flows, then it's like actually not smart to be, in that case, free cash flow Positive. Or you maybewant to be a little Negative at least and not give up a huge number of sales because we'd be talking -- thenumbers get just so crazy. It's 0.25 million units a year. It's roughly $1 billion a month revenue. And so --and you double that and there's $2 billion a month advanced. So maybe spending half -- incremental $0.5billion or -- in CapEx would be a pretty smart move if it advances things by 2 or 3 months.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionYes.","Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research Division.

2017/2/22,"So it just seems like at that level of 250,000, you'd be generating probably at least $2 billion of grossprofit for Model 3. And if you continue this Model X rate, you're at $2.5 billion of gross from that.

2017/5/3,"Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionI was wondering if you could maybe give us an update qualitatively or quantitatively on how investorsshould think about battery costs. I think your last public statement was that Tesla's battery cost earlylast year was under $190 per kilowatt hour. If we look at how Powerwall 2, there's been significantimprovement in cost per kilowatt and in density. But I think if we try and do the math on Powerwall 2,we'd still come up with a number that's reasonably high. So maybe can help us -- I think in the past, Elon,you've said that you hope to get to $100 per kilowatt hour by 2020. And I recognize that's aspirational.But maybe you can help us a little bit frame how we should think about battery cost today, what kind ofimprovement you're seeing from -- or expect to see with 2170 batteries in vehicles going forward.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI mean, regarding numbers for cost [indiscernible] [ are close how competitive ] is the informationexcept that we do expect to see significant improvements year-over-year as much as improving the corechemistry of the cell, reducing essentially the cell mass that is inactive and, of course, mass economiesof scale and vertical integration at the Gigafactory. These will all take time to bear fruit, but there will besignificant time. With the Powerwall, the -- there are a bunch of other costs in the Powerwall that are morethan just the battery cost. So you've got the -- you have the cell cost, and you have -- and you get thecell into a module, you've got all the cooling systems, the control systems, the safety stuff that prevents arunaway, the enclosure, the modem to communicate to the Internet and then [indiscernible] would be thepower electronics to take the power from the cells and eventually convert that to the AC or DC power ofthe house keys. J.B., is there something you'd like to add to that?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerNo. That's a great description. It's a fully integrated product. It's a system, not just a bunch of cells. Sowhen you -- if you're maybe trying to calculate dollar per kilowatt or the cost of the Powerwall, I thinkyou'd find it's extremely competitive against other home energy storage systems. We believe the best. Butthere is a lot of other hardware in there that's all included, all wrapped together in the Powerwall price, soyou don't have to piecemeal the system in your house.Elon R.","Tesla's battery cost early last year was under $190 per kilowatt hour.

2017/5/3,"MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight. But we're quite confident that the Powerwall is the highest quality product and actually at the lowestcost of anything in the market. So that is a good product. And I feel good, feel pretty happy with it.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerAnd some of the improvement trajectory that you saw from Powerwall 1 to Powerwall 2, part of that ismade possible by the migration to 2170 cells made at Gigafactory, not all of it but a large part of it. Sothat is something we're pleased with and feel it's going well.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionOkay. I was wondering also your customer deposits, and I recognize there's a lot in that, declined forthe second straight quarter. And at least by my math, it appears as though Tesla's new car inventoryhas increased substantially over the last couple of quarters, maybe 3,500 units or about 50%, eventhough sort of production and deliveries have been relatively constant. I'm wondering if you are seeingincremental demand pressure on Model X. And particularly Model S, Elon, you underscored that therewas confusion in the marketplace. And are these the metrics that are suggesting to you that there's someconfusion in the marketplace? Are you seeing cancellations? Because at least optically, it looks like thebook-to-bill is less than 1 on S and X.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. Deepak here, a couple of questions that you had. Firstly, just to clarify, [indiscernible] weeklyinventory [indiscernible] very slightly from end of Q4 to end of Q1. And the -- and we are using someof that in different ways, and Jon can explain that further. And also to your other question on customerdeposits, what I'm seeing is that we had an artificial backlog in our customer deposits of Model Xs. And asour production of Model Xs has stabilized and as our mix of Model S has increased relative to X, we havecleared that. So it's nothing unusual from what I'm seeing there. And Jon, do you want to add on the...Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceThat's right. The increase in inventories is about split in 2. One is we increased Model X test drive vehiclesby about 1,000 over the past quarter. We had prioritized deliveries as we ramped up Model X productionand prioritized getting cars to customers first and to our store second. Our stores have finally gotten theirtest drive fleets, and that's what you see in terms of the half of the unit volume increase.","Elon Musk: We're quite confident that the Powerwall is the highest quality product and actually at the lowestcost of anything in the market.

2017/5/3,"The secondhalf is in our service loaners. So as our installed fleet has gone up, we need -- we wanted to make surethat our owners were getting a service loaner, and we'll continually increase that, and you'll see that overtime. That's not a one-time event. You'll see as we continue to deliver this level of cars per quarter thatwe will increase the service loaner fleet proportionally so that we've got the ability to offer a Tesla to ourcustomers.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. And in fact, this'll take us a few months to fully deploy, but our policy for service loaners is that theservice loaner fleet will be the very best version of a Tesla that is available. So if you have a Model Xthat comes in for service, the service loaner you will get will be the absolute fully loaded state-of-the-artP100D Ludicrous, best Model X that we have.

That's being inferred more qualitatively from what you'relearning in showrooms? Or how do you make that assessment of the problem?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThere are no -- we have seen some impact of Model S orders as a function of people being confusedthat Model 3 is the upgrade to Model S. Now we took action to correct that about a month ago, but thatmessage has not filtered down to all of our customers. So there's still a lot of people who are under theimpression that Model 3 is the upgrade from Model S. But in fact, the one upgrade is just by the latestModel S. That's the actual upgrade. Not -- like saying -- thinking that the upgrade path from an Audi A6is an Audi A4. It's not. So yes, so it's just a question of correcting that misconception, which I'm confidentwe'll be able to do in the next several weeks.","Elon R.

2017/5/3,"Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionYou've talked about in the past reinventing the machine that makes the machine. And now that we'regetting a little bit closer to the Model 3 launch, any additional color on what steps in automation you'redoing for the Model 3? And any rough order of magnitude of how much more automated the Model 3would be versus the traditional production line?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. So with Model 3, I think would be roughly comparable with the best high-volume vehicle productionlines in the world, better in some respects, a little worse than others, but roughly comparable. And thenwith some further iteration, I think it will probably be a little bit better than the next-best automotiveproduction line. Then where things will really be a step change I think beyond any other automatedactually will be the Model Y factory. And this is both a function of designing the product to be easy tomanufacture and easy to automate as well as designing the factory itself. So Model Y is where I think itreally becomes a step change, but Model 3 is going to be at or probably slightly better than I think thenext best automotive [indiscernible], that's pretty [indiscernible]. And then Model Y will be -- there'll benothing close to it, I think.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerMaybe just to add as a relative benchmark, against the S and the X, the Model 3 is vastly moreautomated.

And as a follow-up, any color on -- you've announce the doubling of the Supercharger network andincreasing your dealers. I mean, how should we think about that over the next few years? Is that doublinggoing to be enough? Or how do you see the network needing to expand going forward?Elon R.

Just one is, since the Model 3 is maybe 2 or 3 months away, could youjust give us a sense of what some of the most critical outstanding items are that are going to gate thecommercial launch timing? And now that there are actual physical test vehicles on the road, are there anysignificant changes happening?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, actually it seems to be -- we're not really seeing any significant change that needs to occur withModel 3. So it's coming in as expected, as the design continuation has predicted, it's getting pretty closeto the bull's-eye, and I'm not aware of anything that would affect our prior statements about volumetarget.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionSo there's nothing outstanding vis-?-vis tooling, deliveries or things like that, that you're still viewing as acritical item with some uncertainty?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThere's plenty of things with uncertainty, but I don't know anything that would prevent us from startingfirstly in July, and exceeding 5,000 units per week by the end of the year. There may be some cost upthere, I just don't know of what that is today.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionGot it. Just switching gears to China. Obviously, domestic production is presumably very important to yoursuccess in that region. China recently suggested that they may relax the rules for foreign ownership orthat they intend to relax the rules for foreign ownership. And I was wondering if you could just update uson where you stand vis-?-vis the growth plans there? And are the rules for ownership, is that one of thegating factors?Elon R.

Just some thoughts on how we should bethinking about the capital spending relative to your prior targets.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, it's not too far from it, Rod, and we are -- we have significant CapEx in Q2, and it's done in a biglump sum or a little big peak given how much equipment is being installed and then tested.","Elon R.

And most of that semi is actually made out of Model 3 parts, by theway. It's Model 3 -- it's actually using a bunch of Model 3 motors. Probably revealing too much aboutthe future of it. But so we're able to use a very high volume vehicle and then combine several motors tohave something that I think is actually going to have a very good gross margin, like it's -- that's just notsomething that any other -- it's like you can't do that with a traditional truck. So effectively it allows us tohave a very compelling product that has a low unit cost.Jeffrey B.

MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, exactly.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCAnd are we right to think about that though, as a contractual sort of opportunity, right? I mean, you go tosort of a handful of fleet operators and you could sell sort of more vehicles per customer. Is that the rightway to think about it?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThat is how it would occur, yes. So it's essentially much more of a straightforward economic decision forthe operators. They just look at it as a cost per ton per mile [ economy ]. And it's like if it's better, they'lljust buy a huge number. And if it's worse, they won't buy hardly any. And we're confident it'll be better.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCOkay. Great. And then if I just may follow-up on the demand questions that were sort of asked earlier.Wondering as you're getting more used vehicles back into the pipeline, is there any data to support thatyou're using those vehicles to attract a potentially new customer to the brand? Or alternatively, is theredata that would suggest that perhaps could be cannibalizing some of the newer vehicles?

One, Elon, at the TED Talks, and I think a couple tweets, you had talked about adding3 Gigafactories, just following up to Tyler Frank's question on CapEx needs. Can you just talk aboutwhat your ultimate vision of Tesla over the next few years? Model Y factory, truck factories, truck servicecenters, 3 Gigafactories, China schedule, is all of that going to be funded with internal cash? Or do you seepartnerships funding, despite the low margins that the battery industry has? I'm just trying to get a senseof what your ultimate vision will cost.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight. Incremental dilution along the way. It's hard to say. I mean, I'm sure there will be some fundingrounds that happen in the future. It's kind of a trade-off between how fast do we want to grow versus-- like, we can grow slower with no dilution, really. For sure, we could grow at a moderate pace with nodilution.

2017/5/3,"This is [indiscernible] in spite of the incentives, not becauseof them. And -- but these incentives have limited lifetime and they're limited scale -- like, for example,the federal tax credit. And then the -- that caps out at the 200k. The carb credits, which the carb rules arewoefully weak. We can sell -- there are some quarters where we can't even sell carb credits. And whenwe can, it's maybe $0.50 on the dollar, or something like that. Whereas the other car companies get tofully absorb the value of the carb credit. So, for example, gives GM roughly -- I count a $7,000 to $10,000advantage over Tesla for the Chevy Volt. That's why like [indiscernible] well, GM appears to be losing$10,000 a car on the Volt. No, they're not. They're making it up in carb credits. But they get the full retailvalue of the carb credit whereas we get the wholesale value when we're lucky. But the carb credits only --are only effective at a production rate of about 20,000 to 30,000 vehicles a year. So that's why you'll see,mark my words, it's not going to be any higher than that for the Chevy Volt. That's the 25,000 -- on theorder of 25,000 units a year or 1/10th of our initial production rate for the Model 3 or 1/20th of what theModel 3 will be next year. So Tesla's competitive advantage improves as the incentives go away. This is --it continues to be something that is not well understood. And for that they don't -- I'll also mention that --the Nevada tax credits, which for the Gigafactory, it makes it sound like we got a $1.3 billion check fromthe state of Nevada. We did not. Those tax credits are made up -- the vast majority of it is just sales anduse tax abatement on equipment in the Gigafactory. Taxes that otherwise wouldn't been there becausethere was just a bunch of rocks there before. And you don't get a lot of taxes from rocks. So that's whyit is essentially a no-lose proposition for the state. And in order for us to actually earn $1.3 billion in taxcredits for the Gigafactory we have to generate, over the course of 20 years, about $100 billion in outputfrom the Gigafactory. So yes, it's worth about like 1%. And don't want to look a gift horse in the mouthand we appreciate it and that's nice. But this is obviously -- 1% is not the difference between success andfailure for the factory.","Tesla's competitive advantage improves as the incentives go away.

2017/5/3,"Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.Joseph Robert SpakRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research DivisionJust a quick one on service. By our math, if you look at the cumulative number of vehicles you'vedelivered and the amount of stores and service stations, it's a little bit over -- or something around 700per I guess station. And I realize you're adding some more of these mobile units. But I just wanted toknow bigger picture how you think about coverage in the more steady state or at least at 0.5 million unitrate. Like, what is the right level of coverage needed for the larger fleet?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerI think, rather than thinking about store or service center locations, we think about it in terms of mobileunits and lifts. And so we are building larger service centers over time that have more lifts. So our initialservice centers, it might have had 2 or 3 lifts. And we're building now service centers with 40 to 60,sometimes 80 lifts. And so there's a density within the service centers. But the mobile capability expandsthat quite greatly. So I think a lot of people do incorrect analysis to take cars in service divided bylocations, because the locations varies so widely. But that's essentially how we're thinking about capacityand planning capacity. And as Deepak mentioned earlier, our throughputs and efficiency are getting muchbetter over time, and we'll continue to improve those. So it's our goal to stay ahead of the installed basecapacity so we're providing great service. But really the Model 3 has been designed for high reliability.

2017/8/2,"Yes, your line is open.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsAll right. Thank you. All right. We apologize, everyone. Elon, over to you.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderAll right. Thank you. My apologies. We actually tried a new audio system with a bunch of individual mics.That seems to have malfunctioned, so we went back to standard conference call object. Anyway, just wantto confirm, people can hear what I am saying. Okay, great.So first of all, let me say that Friday night was an amazing time for Tesla. It was the -- one of the mostimportant days in the history of the company. It's one we've been striving for, for 14 years. It's the carthat we've -- the Model 3 -- hanging with us [ 30 ] production Model 3s was just an incredible milestone inthe company's history. We wanted to make a great, affordable electric car, which is the fundamental thingthat is missing.We wanted to make that from day one. And if we could only have done it sooner, we would have. And I'mglad that this day has come. What we have ahead of us, of course, is an incredibly difficult productionramp. Nonetheless, I think we've got a great team. And I'm very confident that we'll be able to reach aproduction rate of 10,000 vehicles per week towards the end of next year. And we remain, we believe, ontrack to achieve a 5,000-unit week by the end of this year.So I would simply urge people to not get too caught up in what exactly falls within the exact calendarboundaries of a quarter, one quarter over the next, because when you have an exponentially growingproduction ramp, slight changes of a few weeks here or there can appear to have dramatic changes, butthat is simply because of the arbitrary nature of the -- of when a quarter ends.So -- but what people should absolutely have 0 concern about, 0, is that Tesla will achieve a 10,000-unitproduction week by the end of next year. So if you can associate where we came from, the Roadster, wewere making only 600 units a week, where the nonpowertrain portion of the car was made by Lotus. Andwe did the powertrain and the final assembly of the car, and then we went from that to 20,000 units ayear of the Model S, a far more complex car where we did the whole thing. And then we -- with Model 3,we were more vertically integrated.","Elon Musk: Friday night was an amazing time for Tesla. It was the -- one of the mostimportant days in the history of the company.

2017/8/2,"I think people should really not have any concerns that we won't reachthat outcome from a production rate.We're also very confident about costs. We feel we gained a lot of experience. We certainly aspire tolearn from mistakes of the past. And I think we largely have. Deepak will go into some of our marginexpectations there. And unlike, say for example, the Model X, where the mistake that we made, Iobviously take primary responsibility here, was having far too much advanced technology in version 1 of aproduct, it's an -- Model X is an incredible car, but it was overreaching for the first generation of a product.But in the case of the Model 3, we've strived hard to simplify and make sure that it has everything that'snecessary to be a fantastic car. If you see the reviews, the reviews are -- you really could -- one could notask for better reviews.And I'll just sort of give you one little anecdote, which was -- which I found quite surprising is that whenwe were giving test drives to -- or tests -- the journalists were doing -- were driving the car and doing testdrives. About 80% of the journalists said that they would buy the car themselves. Most of the remaining20% said probably. This is crazy. I've never seen anything like it. So this is a very good sign.It should also be noted that one of our big concerns was that Model S, particularly, and Model X demandwould suffer with the introduction of the 3. In fact, this has turned out to be the opposite situation. ModelS and X demand increased with the release of 3.Jon, would you like to just elaborate on that? There was -- we did express this as a concern, and it was abig concern, but it has turned out to be a pleasant surprise.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceYes, I think that's right. Not only, as Elon said, we expressed it as a concern. We had Positive comps bothyear-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and in orders in the second quarter. But since then, orders haveaccelerated in July as we noted in our shareholder letter. And it accelerated further since the handoverevent on Friday for the Model 3.So it kind of shows that S and X as our flagship products have a strong position in the market and strongdemand. And that's super encouraging that we've got those -- a strong product lineup with 3 cars that areproving to be very popular in their individual segments.Elon R.","We're also very confident about costs.

We've made thatcommitment to the state of New York. We are going to keep that. commitment. So -- and then we're alsothinking hard about where do we put Gigafactories 3, 4, 5 and 6. We expect to keep the majority of ourproduction in the U.S. and -- but, it's obviously going to make sense to establish a Gigafactory in Chinaand Europe, just to serve the markets there because it's not too -- [indiscernible] in California and truckthem halfway around the world, particularly when you're trying to make things as affordable as possible,that really hurt. We really want to get -- make our cars as affordable as possible, and so that does requiresome amount of local market production, particularly for the mass market vehicles in order to make it asaccessible as possible. So we think hard about that. I think we'll have some announcements on at least afew of those locations before the end of the year. But we don't expect to spend significant money on them.Just it's identifying the location, doing the long lead-time stuff, the permits, the planning. This doesn't costa lot of money.

It's like really -- I mean, last week stressed thehell out of me, but I really think that this is -- this is probably the best I've ever felt about the company.And -- oh and one thing I wanted to correct. I think in a prior call, publicly I had said that Model Y or ourcompact SUV, which is called Model Y, may or may not be -- would be totally architecture. I've gone -- I'vedecided -- well, upon the counsel of my executive team, thank you, thank you, thanks, guys, who reeledme back from the Cliffs of Insanity, much appreciated, the Model Y will, in fact, be using a substantialcarryover from Model 3 in order to bring it to market faster. Yes. So that will really accelerate our ability toget Model Y to market faster for -- because it's fundamentally to -- you have people who prefer a sedan,people who prefer an SUV and, in fact, the SUV market is larger which is the biggest single [ proximity ]I believe in the world. So which I thank my executive team for stopping me from being a fool. And yes.So Model Y, what the hell, will be -- have relatively low technical and production reschedule result. I stillthink we want to do the crazy thing in the future, but we will pump that too after the model -- until afterthe compact SUV. Anything else that you think [indiscernible]. So yes, we'll try to leave as much timefor questions as we can. We have a lot of operational issues to get back to but like to make work on thatmanufacturing ramp, and I'm always incredibly grateful for anyone who has -- who is an investor in Tesla.You put your faith in us.

2017/8/2,"Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionI was going to ask you which is harder, AI or AV. But I think at this point, we may not know the answer.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, as you know, I'm terrified of AI.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionI've read that.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, you may have heard that in a few places, and it's just something we -- anyway, I definitely don'twant to rail the conversation on that front. It's just something that I think anything that represents --that is a risk to the public deserves at least insight from the government because one of the mandatesof the government is the public well-being, and that's -- insight is different from oversight. So it's just --at least the government can gain insight to understand what's going on and then decide what rules areappropriate to ensure public safety. That is what I'm advocating for. I'm not advocating for that we stopdevelopment of AI or any of the sort of [indiscernible] hyperbole, things that have been written, I do thinkthere are great benefits to AI. We just need to make sure that they are indeed benefits and we don't dosomething really dumb.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. Well, I hope that doesn't count against my Tesla questions. But the 2 things I was going to askyou were you mentioned in the letter this confidence in getting the 25% margin on Model 3. Could youjust mention what the level of production is that you feel you need to get to in order to get there? Whatrun rate? And secondly, there have been a fair number of battery announcements, solid-state batterytechnology, Toyota and a few others. Can you -- what's your general assessment. Are we getting close tosome kind of breakthroughs here or just what's your thoughts?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderOh, God. Okay, here's my opinion of the battery breakthrough of the week, battery breakthrough dujour. When somebody has like some great claim that they've got this awesome battery, you know what?Send us a sample. Or if you don't trust us, send it to an independent lab where the parameters can beverified. Otherwise, STF. Yes. So everything works on PowerPoint.

2017/8/2,"So Tesla is thebiggest buyer of lithium-ion batteries on earth. You know who people come to first when they've gota lithium-ion battery? Us. Because we're their biggest customer. I would love it if we could have somebreakthrough. It'd be awesome. I think there are some interesting things on the horizon, but then thetime it takes from something working in the lab to working at moderate production levels, to workingat high production levels, to optimizing the cost is several years. So it's not like it suddenly pops out ofnowhere. J.B., do you want to add to that?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerI totally agree with the sort of cautious skepticism on all these announcements. And just more specificallyon the solid-state batteries, Rod. I mean, we do -- we've talked to a number of different groups that areresearching this. We actually have tested a number of those different prototype -- very early prototypesingle cells. But it's -- we don't yet see anything that changes our strategy, and we don't see anythingthere that's...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderHowever, we'd love it if it did. Pretty please. Can someone please come up with a battery breakthrough.We'd love it.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWe would be the first ones to want to implement it.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Totally. I mean, there are some breakthroughs that I think are achievable. I -- they're confidential, soI can't talk about them on this call. But there's one particular avenue that I am confident could be made towork that would be not -- from a -- the most significant one -- breakthrough in a while. But again, you'vegot to make it work in the lab. It doesn't yet work in the lab. It's promising in the lab. You go from the labto small production, then you go to large production, then you get to cost optimization. These are severalyears, okay. I wish it was shorter, but that's the way it goes. So don't worry about that. And yes, so wasthere...Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThe 25% Model 3 gross margin target. When will we get there?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. So J.B. might want to elaborate on this, but I feel like the point at which we are at steady-state 5,000units a week for Model 3 is about when we've reached the 25% gross margin level. So it wouldn't beright when we get to 5,000 because initially when you get to 5,000 a week, there's still a lot of overtime.You're still expediting parts from all around the world.","Tesla is thebiggest buyer of lithium-ion batteries on earth.

2017/8/2,"Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionIn just thinking about your liquidity position, while you're operating with more cash than you historicallyhave, $3 billion, I see you're also guiding to $2 billion CapEx in the back half and you previously said$1 billion of gross cash is as low as you're comfortable operating at. So you guide to Positive cash fromoperations the back half, presumably on your Model 3 ramp in 4Q. But if it's only a little Positive, thenI guess you would be close to your targeted cash level. So the question is can you help us size of howPositive do you expect the cash from operations to be in the back half? And if that level of cash fromoperations plus whatever remains available to draw on your asset-backed line, if that's sufficient cushionfor you relative to your $1 billion target or whether it might make sense to do another equity raise?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Deepak, do you want to...Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, sure, sure, Ryan. So we expect our operating cash flows to be significantly better in the second halfcompared to the first half. At their highest level, scaling generates cash.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, it certainly does.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd it's a better situation in S and X. And our cash conversion cycle, particularly for the next full quarter isgoing to be really great while we are shipping Model 3s in North America. And in addition...Elon R.

MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderClose to 60 days payment terms with our suppliers. The -- and we are also able to make the car a lotfaster. So obviously, the nirvana is that we can make the car and get paid for the car before we have topay our suppliers, which then the faster you grow, the faster your cash position grows. Obviously that'slike the promised land right there. And that's how it's -- what certainly that's how it's -- what we've aimedfor.

2017/8/2,"Now that said, there maybe some wisdom in having a cash cushion for unexpected events. You just never know if there's goingto be some significant force majeure events in the world. It could be an earthquake in California, forexample. And -- but we're not, at this point, considering an equity raise. We are thinking about debt, butwe're not thinking about an equity raise.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOkay. That's very helpful. And then just the follow-up is about the $1 billion of desired minimum grosscash. Does that go up when the Model 3 launches because you're a bigger company? Or does it go downbecause of what you just said about the ability to generate cash and working capital while production isramping?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerIn the long run, it will go up as our balance sheet grows. And just to finish off on your question, we alsohave liquidity through the lines of credit, our ABL line is -- we've just grown it to $1.9 billion. We haveuntapped $800 million there. Of course, how much we can tap there depends on our borrowing base butthat's a source of liquidity. And then for our solar leased assets, we have $700 million of funding which isuntapped on our tax equity funds and aggregation debt. So we have significant amounts of liquidity to beable to fund those lines through.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. One side point that's perhaps worth nothing is that as long as people look at our sort of finishedgoods inventory and compare that to other car companies, but they compare it in the wrong way. BecauseTesla does direct distribution, we are the dealers. You really -- to accurately compare Tesla to other carcompanies, you must include the finished goods inventory, not just at the car companies, but at thedealers. And typically, the -- that combined time of finished goods from manufacturer all the way throughto dealer to an end customer is, I believe, on the order of 90 days.

So I mean how do you -- yes, how doyou frame that and gauge that?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. First of all, actually I should clarify that the number of Superchargers will, in fact, triple betweennow and the end of next year. And that's -- we're confident that, that will address the Superchargingneeds of S, X and 3. So we're trying to stay ahead of it. There are occasional places where -- that aretricky to find a location, like Malibu's really difficult. A few places. But the -- we're staying ahead of that.I think it's going to be good.

There's long-distance route enabling between cities and then there'salso within the cities. And while there are definitely some congestion issues, which we're expanding outof very quickly in the cities, for the most part, the Superchargers that are in between cities have a lotof extra capacity. And we've put those stations in place to serve travel between the cities, but they canabsorb a lot more cars. So even if we double fleet size, it doesn't mean that we need to double the entireSupercharge network. We have to address the few urban sites that are currently in high use, but that canbe done much more efficiently with less CapEx.","The number of Superchargers will, in fact, triple betweennow and the end of next year.

And is the charge time on the 3 the same as the S?I wasn't sure with some of the release.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIt's about the same. Yes, it's comparable to the high-end S. Like your -- the recharge rate of how manymiles per hour you recharge is sort of your function of the battery pack size. So like a 100-kilowatt hourpack -- because charge rate is as a function of percentage of packs. So think of 3 and the high-end S asbeing similar in charge rates. And over time, we want to keep moving that rate up.

I had said that there were 500,000 net reservations. Well, I did alsosay that I wasn't sure because I don't follow this number and that this was just a guess.

Sir, you may begin.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsThank you, Latif, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's third quarter 2017 Q&A webcast. I'mjoined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and Jon McNeill.Our third quarter results were previously announced in the update letter we published at the same link asthis webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recentfilings with the SEC.Before we jump in to the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSo, pardon me for 1 minute. I have a bit of a cold. So let's see. Actually, we're doing this call from theGigafactory because that's where the production constraint is for Model 3, from the most important thingfor the company. And I always move my desk to wherever -- well, it's not like we have a desk, actually. Imove myself to wherever the biggest problem is in Tesla. Somewhat, I really believe that one should leadfrom the front lines, and that's why I'm here, and I'll go into some of the Gigafactory issues later in thecall, but I'd like to start off by acknowledging some, I think, pretty amazing milestones for Tesla.One thing that I thought was really profound was that we surpassed cumulative deliveries of vehicles. Wesurpassed 0.25 million cumulative deliveries since the company's inception and had record Model S and Xnet orders and deliveries last quarter. So things are really, I think, going quite well.To put that into perspective, 5 years ago, we had only delivered 2,500 cars. So our -- the Tesla fleethas grown by a factor of 100 in 5 years. I would expect, 5 years from now, to be at least an order ofmagnitude, we're beyond where we are right now and possibly even closer towards magnitude.But for the skeptics out there, I'd like to say -- ask them, which one of you predicted that Tesla would gofrom 2,500 units delivered to 250,000 units delivered now? I suspect the answer is 0, right? So consideryour assumptions for the future on whether they're valid or perhaps pessimistic.So for Model 3, we continue to make significant progress each week.","Elon Musk, J.B.

2017/11/1,"There are 4 zones to module manufacturing. So it goes through 4major production zones. The zones 3 and 4 are in good shape; zones 1 and 2 are not. Zone 2 in particular,this is -- we had a subcontractor -- a systems integration subcontractor that unfortunately really droppedthe ball, and we did not realize the degree to which the ball was dropped until quite recently, and we hadto -- this is a very complex manufacturing area. We had to rewrite all of the software from scratch andredo many of the mechanical and electrical elements of zone 2 of module production. We've managedto rewrite what was about 20 to 30 man years of software in 4 weeks, but there's still a long way togo. It's -- because the software work can be fast with the electromechanical elements that need to befabricated and installed, and that -- getting these items in place and rebuilt is, unfortunately, a lot longer,and that's -- it's probably more external constraints than software. This is what I spent many a late nighton the Gigafactory working on. J.B. has been here constantly, and we've -- we allocated many of our bestengineers to fundamentally fixing zone 2 of the module line and then most problem behind that it is zone1.On the plus side, we now have a very detailed understanding of what is necessary to fix zone 1 and zone2. We also have a new design for zone 1 and 2 that is about 3x more effective than the current design. Sowhen we put in -- and there are 3 lines of module production. Lines 1, 2 and 3 are essentially identical.Line 4, which will have the new design, will be at triple the effectiveness of -- will be as good as the other3 lines combined.

2017/11/1,"Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionGreat. Just with regard to the ramp-up of the Model 3 production, I can see what's happening with the5,000 per week target from 1Q to 4Q -- or from, now, it's 1Q versus 4Q. But I think it's less clear fromreading the letter, what's happening with the previous guidance of the 10,000 units per week at somepoint in 2018? Is that now like beyond 2018? I think, before, investors were estimating that if you couldhit it at the end of '18, you'd do over 250,000 vehicles. If you could hit it more towards the middle, you'ddo over 325,000. But what now would be a reasonable expectation based upon what you know for theModel 3s that do get built in 2018?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSo it's a bit too early to make the exact number. But I think, if you extrapolate from 5,000 units towardsthe end of Q1, we do want to hold off on giving CapEx until we are confident about cash flow on Model 3.So then that's a question of how long it takes to implement everything necessary to get to 10,000 units aweek for Model 3, which is a number we are confident can be sustained from a [ grand ] standpoint.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd we want to figure out how much we can push the 5,000 up from the existing equation.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, that is true.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd then learn from those and figure out, how do we redesign what will we do for the next step and spendmore efficiently our CapEx? So it's the right thing to do.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Yes, exactly. As I mentioned earlier, we're finding that some parts of the line, they very clearly arecapable of 6,000 or that 7,000 units a week, and maybe more than that, just by shortening path length,speeding up robots, adding some robots where there are -- where the choke points exist, simplifying someof the processes and a few minor part redesigns sum up for how much you can improve cycle time.

BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOh, I was just going to say, is the gross margin discussion also related to this at all? I mean, I see thereduced outlook for 4Q, but do you feel any differently about, for example, the ability to do 25% marginwhen you're doing kind of 250,000 run rate? And as long as the production is going to be restrained,do you have any ability to continue to preference for longer maybe the higher-margin, higher trim levelvariance of the Model 3 to help with that?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerWe can fine-tune those things when we get there, but overall, our -- and I'm reinforcing this again, theseare all short-term issues, and it doesn't change our long-term prognosis on Model 3 gross margin.","Elon R.

MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderAnd X, but particularly Model S, because we're hoping it to be greater differentiation between the S andthe Model 3. So the basic cost, the fundamental cost of a Model S increased because of more includedcontent. So the full Model Ss have air suspension, for example, perhaps a bunch of premium contentswere included by default. Just about there needs to be a get clear reason for people to buy a Model S overa Model 3.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceAnd the market responded really strongly to that in terms of demand. So in Q3, the Model S in the U.S.outsold the Mercedes S-Class by 2x -- over 2x, actually.

It'sjust sort of perhaps from about 2,000 units a week to 1,800, and we did in order to bring down inventory.So mainly just because inventory was too high. We also just needed a bunch of people on the Model 3line. So we thought we'll take the third shift from Model S and the X and apply it to Model 3. Becausereally, running out of labor pool, honestly.

It sounds like you're going to be deploying some capital to increase to 10,000 units per week. Andobviously, there've also been some reports about you investing in another assembly facility in China. So isyour CapEx still expected to be lower in 2018 versus 2017?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerSo Rod, in terms of the China factory, I'll leave for Elon to make comments on that. But I think maybebetter if we hold on, broadly speaking, to that question to the next quarter when we provide full 2018guidance and give you better clarity on our capital spend for the different elements in our plan.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI suspect it's comparable and similar to 2017. We have some -- obviously some -- it's somewhat of astrategic choice. Do we have higher CapEx and higher growth or lower CapEx and lower growth? Yes.So it's -- if we do that we can move that lever where it makes sense, where it makes sense to do so. Asmentioned earlier though, we want to make sure we know what to scale before we spend money on it.And so for the Model 3, figuring out which production lines can be simply accelerated and which productionlines need to be duplicated. We'd far rather accelerate production line than duplicate it. If we were tomake those CapEx decisions because right now, we'd be making them -- we'd be kind of shooting in thedark.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, exactly.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderBut -- in respect to China, I wouldn't expect any significant CapEx on China until 2019. It won't bematerial in 2018. The China plan is sort of maybe something like -- this is just a -- like don't set yourwatch by this, but we -- it's sort of a rough target of start manufacturing in about 3 years, and it wouldbe serving the China market and perhaps the -- some other countries in the region. And that's really itsintent, is to be able to provide Model 3 and Model Y.

2017/11/1,"Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionYes, I have a question and a follow-up, please. Elon, you just talked about sort of this trade-off betweengrowth and capital spending. And quite frankly, I think it's really the first time that I've heard you talkabout that potential trade-off. Usually, Tesla's been all about doing as much as quickly as possible to leadthe move to electrification, to establish a first-mover advantage, et cetera. So is the hesitancy in goingall-out growth? Is that a concern that you might run out of cash and have to raise more cash? Is that abandwidth concern for the organization in terms of trying to do too much too quickly? Is that a concernabout using capital effectively? What's at the root of that decision? And why isn't the -- why is there evena decision, I guess, is the question?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerI mean, I would say it's probably a bit of all. I mean, it's prudent for us to think through all of that as weare continuing to grow. Certainly, we would want to be in a certain sense of fiduciary responsibility that wehave in addition to just growing like crazy. So...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI mean, these are mad, substantial growth rates for the car industry. And I think some made somecomparison of Tesla's growth rate relative to Ford in the Model T era. And we're talking about a rate ofgrowth faster than the Model T, which is the fastest in history. So these are nutty growth rates.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerIt's certainly not the first time we've thought about this.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. We have talked about that. When our growth rate, I don't have -- recall the exact numbers, but Ithink it's been in the 70%, 80% every year. And next year even with 5,000, it'll be like crazy compared tothis year. So our growth rate continues to be extraordinary.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Yes. If our growth rate continues at anything like that in the coming years, I mean, if it continues tobe something like that, Tesla will be the largest car company in the world by volume as well.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceAnd Toni, it may be helpful if it accelerates with new product introductions too.

2017/11/1,"Our next question comes from Brian Johnson of Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionYes, wanted to just drill down on the service revenue and expenses line. Not something we often talkabout, but a lot of the other questions have been asked. Looks like year-over-year revenues were up $180million, costs were up $247 million. Could you just talk about the drivers of that change between what'sleft of the drivetrain outsource business, the CPO business, the service loaner actual vehicles expense andthen the cost of the PP&E for the actual people and service infrastructure?Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceYes. So I think what you see there is the increase in PP&E for the service infrastructure. We wanted toget out in front of demand as we're increasing both S and X fleet size and also of Model 3. So we openeda location just about every 4 days in Q3. And to get ahead of that demand, you probably saw that weput 180 mobile vehicles on the road, and we plan to double that this quarter. And so a lot of that, whatyou see is PP&E. In terms of the drivetrain issue that you mentioned, that's mostly behind us. In fact, wesee very little of that now. The reliability for S and X continues to improve. And you asked about the CPObusiness. The CPO business, for us, last year -- or last quarter was about a $238 million revenue business.We expect that to grow to $1 billion run rate -- or $1 billion business for all of 2017. And so that businessis growing rapidly at the same time. And we're running those -- we do our own CPO refurbishment. We dothat in the same service infrastructure that we're servicing the cars. So you see a little bit of that cost intothat line as well.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. And my follow-on for Deepak, probably, is can you walk us through the depreciation when youproduce, for example, in the second quarter those 100 -- P100D cars Mr. Musk talked about going into theloaner fleet? Where do those -- how do those get depreciated while they're in the loaner fleet? And whenthey're transferred to be sold, what's the accounting on that?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes.

Yes.John Douglas FieldSenior Vice President of EngineeringIt's not the same level of constraint as the Gigafactory, but it is one of the more complex parts of theoverall assembly line. So to reach our overall production goals, that has to ramp significantly. But again,it's not at the same level of constraint as modules. And it's really driven just by the sheer number ofrobots in the body shop. It's the highest concentration of robots anywhere in our overall production line.But it is coming up well.

2018/2/7,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Tesla Inc. Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsQ&A Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to Senior Director ofInvestor Relations, Mr. Martin Viecha. Please go ahead, sir.Martin ViechaThank you, Andrew, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2017 Q&A Webcast.I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and Doug Field is on the line.Our 4Q results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter we published at thesame link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-lookingstatements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events orresults could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in ourmost recent filings with the SEC. Before we jump to Q&A, Elon would like to have some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight, thank you. So 2017 was also a big year for Tesla. We launched the Model 3, which was our firstmass production vehicle, and it's a huge step change for Tesla. A lot of challenges but I think we madetremendous progress on that front.We also designed and installed and got into operation the world's largest battery in Australia, the largestbattery by a significant margin. And that battery is exceeding its performance targets significantly. We alsounveiled the Tesla Semi, which is a super heavy-duty truck, maximum load semi truck, and the next-genRoadster, which we believe will exceed gasoline sports cars on every dimension.And we also achieved record production and deliveries of Model S and X. And overall, I think, whilethere were challenges associated with Model 3 ramp at the -- we were in a deeper level of hell than weexpected. So a few levels deeper than we'd like to be but swiftly exiting, I think. And so it's really, Ithink, on balance, a phenomenal year. And I'd like to thank everyone at Tesla, who should be very proudof the work they've done. This is incredibly difficult. I'd like to thank everyone for their hard work andcontribution to 2017 being a really good year for Tesla.I also want to thank our suppliers, particularly those involved in Model 3, as they've shared the verticalstruggle we've had in ramping our production, and they've really burned the midnight oil, spent weekendsand taking a lot of risks and suffered alongside us in the challenges associated with the ramp.","Tesla Inc.

2018/2/7,"So I'd liketo thank them for supporting us through this difficult time with Model 3.As well, our customers and Model 3 reservation holders, you're going to love your cars, and we areworking to get them to you as quickly as we possibly can. As for Model 3 production, we continue to makesignificant progress every day, and we are targeting a weekly production rate of 2,500 vehicles by the endof March and 5,000 by the end of Q2.And as what's been -- or you've seen in the letter, the quarter-over-quarter production of Model 3 is risingexponentially. So I hope we'll -- that people think that if we can send a Roadster to the asteroid belt, wecan probably solve Model 3 production. It's just a matter of time. So -- and really the error bars on thetiming are really quite small in the grand scheme of things.So it's -- 2018 is likely to be a very big year for us. At some point in 2018, we expect to begin generatingPositive quarterly operating income on a sustained basis, operating 5,000 a week of Model 3 production.And I am cautiously optimistic that we will be GAAP profitable. It's not certain, but it's -- I'm cautiouslyoptimistic that we will actually be GAAP profitable with no asterisk.Martin ViechaThank you, Elon. Andrew, let's go to the first question.","We are targeting a weekly production rate of 2,500 vehicles by the end of March and 5,000 by theend of Q2. 2018 is likely to be a very big year for us.

2018/2/7,"I'm showing we have a question from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionCongratulations on the launch yesterday. Wanted to just ask a couple of questions. One is just to get alittle bit more color from you on Model 3, what the production run rate is at the moment. Maybe if you canjust provide us with a little bit more color on where the challenges are at this point? On the last call, youtalked about, I think, 2 of the 4 zones at Gigafactory that were still kind of an issue in manual operation.Have those been resolved? And once you get to 2,500, is the ramp to 5,000 -- does that just merelyinvolve increasing line speeds?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSure. I'll try to give as much color as possible. I am reminded of -- I think it may have been Churchill'sline about sausage. If you like sausage and respect the law, you should watch neither being made. Andjust to me, that is true of a production ramp. So I wouldn't read too much into the day-to-day battles ofthis or that, but I'll give you the color, but don't like -- don't read too much into it. So yes, there are 4zones in module production. Module production is fundamentally the limiting factor on Model 3 output,which is ironic since battery modules really should be the thing we're best at. And I think in part, wewere probably a little overconfident, a little complacent in thinking about this is something we know andunderstand and put a lot of attention on other things, not -- and just got too comfortable with our abilityto do battery modules because we've been doing that since the start of the company. And of the 4 zones,2 of them, which is subcontracted to -- the production system is subcontracted to other companies, flatout, didn't work, it turns out. Like I mean, we were promised they would work, and it just didn't work. Sowe had to do what would normally be maybe an 18-month development cycle for a production system ofthat scale and complexity and tried to do that in basically 6 months, maybe a little -- 6 to 9 months. Andwe've tackled that on multiple levels, so we have a design that is nearing completion for a new automatedsystem for zone 1 and 2. That is being led by a Tesla ground team.","Elon R.

2018/2/7,"It's an excellent design. All the otherwork that they've done has been -- has performed to spec. And we expect a single Tesla ground lineto be equivalent to 3, if not 4, of the current lines that we have and be smaller, which is, for me, kindof amazing. And then we have what we call a semiautomatic line, which is a series of small automatedstations manned by people. And they've actually been remarkably effective. It has sort of renewed myfaith in humanity that the rapid evolution of progress and the ability of people to adapt rapidly has -- isquite remarkable. Our semiautomatic -- our sort of semi-manual, semiautomatic line is exceeding all 3 ofthe automatic lines right now. So -- and that is something that we're able to scale quite rapidly. I mean,J.B., is there additional color you'd like to add on that?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerSure, that's a great summary of it. I think much has been made about the manual production of modules.That's really not very accurate. These are, as Elon said, semiauto lines where we have people theremoving materials perhaps between the machines that are actually performing the operations. But there isstill a degree of automation doing the operation.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight. It's not artisanal.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerExactly. And this is what has been ramping quite effectively in the last -- in the first half -- the first part ofthis year. So we're continuing to expand that, the semiauto lines, and that is effectively bridging the gapas we redesign the full automation and bring that online.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. And it's pretty -- it's a small thing. So actually, I think it's probably worth providing some tours forinvestors that are interested, so you can actually see it first-hand. I think a lot of it is like if you see itfirst-hand, you will understand exactly what's going on. And so I think let's arrange for some new toursfor investors that are interested because I think you can really get a feel for what it is. Otherwise, it's justsome words that are kind of hard to put -- hard to imagine.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerI also just want to add, I think it's fair to say that this maybe degree of complacency that happened at theend of last year has been pretty thoroughly replaced by an intense focus from a huge portion of the Teslateam.","A single Tesla ground lineto be equivalent to 3, if not 4, of the current lines that we have and be smaller.

2018/2/7,"And there are a lot of different initiatives and teams, whole teams, targeted at this area. So as Elonopened with, it's not a question of if we will get to the production rate, it's just a question of the matter oftime.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, absolutely.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionIf I could just clarify, what's the run rate now with semiautomation? And when are you expecting the fullyautomated line to come on?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, it's probably a level of granularity that is not productive to dive into in terms of exactly what iscoming from which operation. But we do expect the new automated lines to be landing and starting out atthe Gigafactory in just the next -- well, the landing in sight within this quarter.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, expect the new automated lines to arrive next month, in March. And then it's already -- it's been-- it's working in Germany so that's going to tracked -- going to be disassembled, brought out to theGigafactory and reassembled and then go into operation at the Gigafactory. It's not of question whetherit works or not. It's just a question of disassembly, transport and reassembly. So that's kind of -- yes. Sowe expect to alleviate that constraint. That -- with alleviating that constraint, that's what gets us to theroughly 2,000 to 2,500 unit per week production rate. The next constraint would be material conveyanceat our Fremont vehicle plant. And that's a very sophisticated automated parts conveyance system. Wethink it's probably the most sophisticated in the world or at least we're not aware of one that is more so.And the software for that is quite complex. So that would be the next constraint on production to get to5,000, is the conveyance system in Fremont. So that also appears to be on track. So we feel like the errorbars around the unit volume predictions are getting smaller with each passing week.","Elon R.

2018/2/7,"An exponential always appears -- the predictions are conservativein the beginning, and then the exponential takes off, and then it becomes linear, and then it becomeslogarithmic. So it's easier to predict -- far easier to predict the endpoint or the steady state of the S-curvethan anywhere on that exponential -- or log curve. So if you say 4 years, I think 100,000 units a year is areasonable expectation. Maybe more but that's the right -- roughly the right number, I think.Tyler Charles FrankRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionFor the Tesla Semi?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I think we might be able to exceed the specs that we unveiled last year too, which is pretty exciting.I know there's, like, speculation that we might not meet them, but I think we're going to exceed them.So -- and I made this comment before. It's like -- feels like I gloss over these comments, but I reallytake these to heart. The competitive strength of Tesla long term is not going to be the car. It's going tobe the factory. We're going to productize the factory. And really this is the lesson that is kind of obviousin history because the Model T wasn't a product. It was River Rouge. The Model T is a very simple car.Anybody could have made that car, but not anyone could make River Rouge. And that's really what wouldbe Tesla's long-term competitive advantage. We'll have a great lineup of great products, great design,great engineering the product itself in the vehicles and autonomy and all that sort of stuff. But the factoryis going to be the product that has the long-term sustained competitive advantage, in my opinion.","The competitive strength of Tesla long term is not going to be the car.

2018/2/7,"And our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionElon, on your autonomous vehicle strategy, why do you believe that your current hardware set of onlycamera plus radar is going to be able to get you to fully validated autonomous vehicle system? Most everycompetitor noted that they need the redundancy from LIDAR hardware given the robustness of the 3Dpoint cloud and the data it's generated. What are they missing in their software stack and their algorithmsthat Tesla's able to obtain from just a camera plus radar? Further, what would be your response if theregulatory bodies require that level of redundancy and that's really needed from an incremental LIDARhardware?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Well, first of all, I should say there's actually a 3-sensor systems test. There are cameras, redundantforward cameras. There are -- there's the forward radar, and there's -- there are the ultrasonics for nearfield. So a third is also -- a third set is also important for near field stuff just as it is for humans. But Ithink it's pretty obvious that the road system is geared towards passive optical. We have to solve passiveoptical image recognition extremely well in order to be able to drive in any given environment and achanging environment. We must solve passive optical image recognition. We must solve it extremelywell. At the point at which we have solved it extremely well, what is the point in having active optical,meaning LIDAR, which does not -- which cannot read signs? It's just giving you -- in my view, it is acrutch that will drive companies to a local maximum, that we'll find very difficult to get out of. If you takethe hard path of a sophisticated neural net that's capable of advanced image recognition, then I thinkyou'll achieve the goal maximum. And we combine that with increasingly sophisticated radar, and if you'regoing to pick active photon generator, doing so in 400 to 700-nanometer wavelength is pretty silly sinceyou're getting that passively. You would want your active photon generation in the radar frequencies ofapproximately around 4 millimeters because that is occlusion penetrating. And you can essentially seethrough snow or rain, dust, fog, anything. So it's just -- I find it quite puzzling that companies wouldchoose to do an active photon system in the wrong wavelength. They're going to get a whole bunch ofexpensive equipment, most of which makes the car sort of expensive, ugly and unnecessary, and I thinkthey will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage.","The road system is geared towards passive optical.

2018/2/7,"Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah with Nomura.Romit Jitendra ShahNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research DivisionIt sounds like from the letter that you could do more than 100k S and X in '18 but you're constrained bythe 18650s. And I'm just curious, what would it take to see the 2170 cells in these vehicles?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, this is J.B. It's something we've, of course, contemplated, but it's quite a large change to thearchitecture of the module and the battery pack overall. And while the 18650 supply is somewhat of acap at about 100k units per year, even just a few months ago, we didn't feel that expanding and makingsome long-term bets on expanding that supply with Panasonic in Japan was really the right risk. It'ssomething we could consider, but right now, we're pretty happy with that balance, and it matches ourother production capabilities and our other investments.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, it's also like -- for any given complex manufactured item, in order to go past the target capacity,you really need to move the whole supply chain in cadence. So you really have to then shift everythingto say, okay, if you want to make 20% more S and X, everyone has to make 20% more, there have tobe investments in new lines or it's going to require overtime, which Negatively affects gross margins.We [ didn't ] design the manufacturing machine for it [ to break ], and then you'd have to redesign themachine or go redline. And so I think we feel pretty good about the 100k a year for S and X, and we wantto focus on just improving the efficiency of production and the gross margin of the group.Romit Jitendra ShahNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research DivisionOkay. Yes, makes sense...Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology Officer[ Keeping, of course, ] the Model 3. I mean, that's really where the majority of the effort is.Romit Jitendra ShahNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research DivisionOkay. The other thing you guys mentioned was upcoming autonomous coast-to-coast drive, which we'rereally looking forward to. Could you give a little bit more color on time frame, when something like thatwould be available for customers?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. So we actually -- I've been meaning to address this but -- because obviously, I missed the mark onthat front. Our focus is very much on Model 3 production, so everything else kind of took a second placeto that.","It sounds like from the letter that you could do more than 100k S and X in '18 but you're constrained bythe 18650s.

So [ although ] you would be able to repeat it, but just not any otherroute, which is not really a true solution. I am pretty excited about how much progress we're makingon the neural net front. And it's a little -- it's also one of the things that's kind of exponential, where theprogress doesn't seem like -- it doesn't seem like much progress, it doesn't seem like much progress,then suddenly, wow. That's been my observation generally with AI stuff. And you look at, say, somethinglike what people at DeepMind did with AlphaGo. It went from not being able to beat even a pretty goodGo player to something that could beat the European champion, then it could beat the world champion,then it could thrash the world champion, then it could thrash everyone simultaneously. Then they madeAlphaZero, which could thrash AlphaGo, where it's just winning against itself, was better than all theworld's human experts. It's kind of going to be like that for self-driving.

2018/2/7,"But we think it makes sense to invest in Model Y and -- yes.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerFuture growth of our energy products, Model 3, future growth of that so...Elon R.

And what I find sort of interesting is that ourcompetitors -- well, the car industry thinks they're really good at manufacturing. And they're actually-- they are quite good at manufacturing, but they just don't realize just how much potential there is forimprovement. It's way more than they think. I went through this math, I think, on a prior earnings call,but like it sounds like some of the -- the fastest car factories produce a car maybe every 25 seconds. Itsounds fast. But if you think about a 5-meter long car including gap, a 4.5-meter car with 0.5 meter gapor something, that's only 0.2 meters per second. Like grandma with a walker can beat the speed of thefastest production line on earth. So really not that fast. Walking speed is 1 meter per second, so 5x fasterthan the fastest production line on earth. Why? It should at least be jogging speed. I mean, in the limit,companies should start caring about the aero drag in the factory, which -- that's maybe around 20 or 30miles an hour or ""30 kilometers an hour, 40 kilometers an hour.""

2018/2/7,"And our next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionYou commented in the shareholder letter that capital expenditures for 2018 were expected to be a bithigher than 2017. I'm wondering if you could tell us what exactly is in that, call it, roughly $3.5 billion. Areyou going to get to full like 10,000 car per week capacity? Is that in the $3.5 billion? What will Gigafactoryproduction be? And in the slightly more than $3.4 billion, is that also including the investments, Elon, thatyou mentioned on Model Y? So where exactly is this level of capital spending going to take us in 2018?And I have a follow-up, please.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerSure, I mean, our biggest -- at a very high-level sort of breakdown, our biggest investment is obviouslyin the Model 3. And that includes completion of the payments that we still have to make on the capacitywe are putting in place now as well as significant investment in -- or required upfront for the next phaseof Model 3 production to 10,000-plus per week.

And our next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Toni, could you tell us what exactly is in that, call it, roughly $3.5 billion. Areyou going to get to full like 10,000 car per week capacity? Is that in the $3,5 billion? What will Gigafactoryproduction be? And in the slightly more than $2.4 billion, is that also including the investments, Elon, that",,
2018/2/7,"But for next quarter, you're suggesting thatthey're going to be Negative again despite the fact that I think Q1 volumes are much higher than what youwould have anticipated originally for Q4 when you thought that margins would be breakeven. So can youhelp reconcile the apparent enthusiasm you have about the gross margin trajectory with the fact that yourguidance around gross margins in the near term actually appears more cautious than it was guided at thetime?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerCan you hear us?A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionYes, I can hear you.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, no worries. Yes, to sort of finish off your first part of the question, no, we will still have furtherinvestments in the 10,000 per week capacity of the Model 3 happening next year as all of that will beconcluded next year. There's always a lag in our cash outflow while we continue to test the equipmentand verify it. So that'll continue in '18 -- in '19. And then in terms of the Model 3 gross margins, ourexpectations earlier were of a much steeper ramp than what we are projecting here. We were targeting,as you well know at one point, hitting 5,000 by the end of '17. And now that's 6 months later. So -- butthat's slower ramp. We just know we'll have inefficiencies. We have the full capacity, so the depreciation ofall that equipment and the operating costs are hitting while we're not producing as many cars. It's actuallypretty simple. And it's only temporary. It doesn't imply anything fundamental.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, exactly. The problem is like when you've got a machine where most of that machine, I mean thatoverall production and supply chain machine, is at a 5,000-unit capacity but then 10% or 15% of it isn't,then you got this massive load on a small -- on a way smaller production volume. Then as that productionvolume -- as you fix that remaining 10% or 15% of the production machine, you're able to get to thattarget production, and then things improve dramatically. It's sort of like having a car that's operating ata fraction of its -- let's use a gas-themed analogy. We've got a 4-cylinder car operating on 1 cylinder. It'slike, okay, it's not so great, one full -- or suppose it is -- machines were -- it's just like a big machineessentially, yes.","Q1 volumes are much higher than what youwould have anticipated originally for Q4 when you thought that margins would be breakeven.

I'd like to talk, follow-up a little bit on the first question around some of the manufacturing roadblocksas well as the comment about building a machine to build the machine, which I believe was the title of a1990 MIT book about Toyota. Could you maybe give us some more discussion really on the managerialculture, the process level, how you would benchmark yourself, for example, against the Toyota factory,which seems to be able to launch new product in about 3 or 4 months, to ramp up? Or at the otherextreme, because I know Mr. Field came from there, kind of what Foxconn does in its goal to replacehumans? But in particular, talk about the managerial processes, not so much the robots you're putting intoplace.Elon R.

2018/2/7,"Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionShockingly, I want to follow up on the production of the Model 3, so it seems like that's going to remaina hot topic here. Do you have enough experience with production of the Model 3 outside of the issuesyou're facing in the Gigafactory that you're confident once those problems are solved, you can get up andrunning? Or is there sort of a contingency here that once you get that worked out, you'll be ramping upin 3 months, and there might be some other hurdles that are discovered? I'm just trying to understand ifthere are some -- any incremental kinks that might come in the production process as you ramp up. Andthen also as we think about the step from 5,000 to 10,000, is that something that can be done inside theFremont factory? It sounds like you're confident that your density is much higher than what even Toyotaand GM were producing out there potentially on capacity. But just curious on those 2 [ things ].Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. There's really -- there are only 2 things that I'm aware of that are constraints in production ofany significance: the module being the most significant; and then the parts conveyance, basically, theautomated conveyance system that brings parts to the lines. The way the Fremont factory is set upis that there's actually, on the ground floor, we actually created 2 levels. The bottom level is all partsconveyance, so parts coming from the warehouse where the parts are sort of automatically sorted andthen are transferred through an automated conveyance system all the way to the line on the conveyancesystem being on the ground floor and then raised up to the line, which is actually on kind of an artificialmezzanine. And I think we can get 10,000 vehicles a week out of Fremont without a significant -- withoutcreating really any new buildings of significance in the existing space. We will need to bring up the southpaint shop, which is what we actually were using for S and X paint, and so we upgraded north paint todo S, X and 3. But with relatively small CapEx, way less than we spent on north paint, we're comfortablewe can bring south paint up to achieve the approximately 600,000 vehicles per year rate to combined100,000 S and X, 500,000 3, which would be 20% to 30% more than Toyota and GM produced in thesame facilities.","Elon Musk: There's really -- there are only 2 things that I'm aware of that are constraints in production ofany significance.

2018/2/7,"These things get increasinglydifficult, but they're all doable. But I can see a path where we get to, say, 600,000 Model 3 production and100,000 S and X, so maybe 700k. We should be like almost 50% more than GM and Toyota get out of theplant. I think that seems achievable.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionCan I just sneak one in for Deepak? I apologize. You did a great job of working capital in the quarter.I mean, I think some of us might kind of throw stones and say it might not be repeatable. But you didit, you got the cash in the door. So it's done and it was -- you did some pretty good work here. Howrepeatable do you think the benefit from working capital is going forward? I mean, is this really just thebenefit of Negative working capital and as you ramp up, you'll get this cash inflow? And then also as welook at the customer deposits and the ZEV credits, those were 2, I think, apparently large cash inflows. Imean, how repeatable do you think those are in the future as well?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. Some of those are not repeatable. We significantly reduced the finished goods inventory of Sand X in Q4, which will not repeat itself going forward. And that was a huge impact to our workingcapital. Customer deposits may not be as well, as you pointed out. However, the -- as the Model 3 rampcontinues, the Negative working capital needs for that, which essentially creates extra cash for us, will berepeatable. And we'll continue to keep very tight controls on our accounts receivables and everything elsewe do to manage cash to make sure we are being efficient.Martin ViechaThank you very much.

2018/2/7,"Our last question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCA topic that doesn't get asked, I think, a lot or as much as it should but we believe is maybe one of thereasons why the Model S and X demand remains so high after many years of production is sort of theover-the-air updateability of these vehicles. I'm just wondering, it had been several quarters ago kind ofpre Model 3 questions we're hearing more about software you were rolling out to existing customers. Justwondering if you can give us some color on what level of uptake you're seeing. And I would imagine we'renot seeing that in the upfront Model S and X margins, but potentially, there are some sort of -- those arevehicles that are earning assets for you in the future sort of customer ownership. So if you could kind oftalk a little bit about what trends you're seeing there or elaborate a little bit on that, that would be helpful.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I think probably the biggest item is as we get the software right, people upgrading to full self-drivingcapability of S and X, and anything with Hardware 2, which is like the 8 cameras, more advanced opsights and improved compute capability, I think, will be capable of the full self-driving. The full self-driving-- the Hardware 2 set is also capable of doing an easy swap out of the computer. So if it turns out weneed additional computing capability to meet the regulatory standards for self-driving -- particularly likewe think with the current compute hardware, we can get to better than human. But the standard forregulators may be that you need to be 5x better than human or something like that. But we believe that issolvable purely with compute hardware. And it would be a relatively minor expense to do that. So I thinkprobably that's the biggest opportunity.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd along the same lines, not all customers pay for enhanced autopilot too, and as people hear more, wecan see an uptick on that. But it's all around autopilot, to your point.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, exactly. And that -- some of the sort of semiautomated driving definitely doesn't require anyhardware upgrades than that $5,000, that's essentially a software product with 0 cost -- 0 marginal costand so it's 100% margin.

2018/5/2,"And I think, in general, our understanding of production is improving dramatically --exponentially, in fact, and we are seeing ways to achieve improved volume with dramatically less CapExby simplifying the production line, by really engaging with our associates, no matter how junior, andimproving the way that parts are made. It's amazing how everybody's got good ideas. Just need tosolicit those ideas and implement them and then making ongoing design improvements so that when wediscover that something is not well designed for manufacturing, that we will very quickly change that partdesign and introduce that into the flow.One of the things we also found is that there are some things that are very well suited to manualoperation and some things that are very well suited to automated operation, and the 2 should not beconfused. So I should be clear that the vast majority of the Tesla production system is automated.However, as I mentioned in a tweet a few months ago, we did go too far in the automation front andautomated some pretty silly things. One example would be we have this -- so this is sort of ironicallyfoolish. We had these fiberglass mats on the top of the battery pack, but basically like -- they're basicallyfluff. So we tried to automate the placement and bonding of fluff to the top of the battery pack, whichis ridiculous. Like so we had fluffer bot, which was really an incredibly difficult machine to make work. 5Machines are not good at picking up pieces of fluff, okay. Human hands are way better at doing that. Andso we had a super complicated machine using a vision system to try to put a piece of fluff on the batterypack. That same -- and one of the questions asked was, ""Do we actually need that?"" So we tested a carwith and without and found that there was no change in the noise volume in the cabin, so we actually hada part that was unnecessary that was -- of course, the line kept breaking down because fluffer bot wouldfrequently just fail to pick up the fluff or put it in like a random location. So that was one of the silliestthings I found.We were also -- and this still remains to be fixed, but -- in a lot of cases, but we're overgeneralizing thedesign.","The vast majority of the Tesla production system is automated.

I think you had said lastquarter that once you got to 5,000 units, you felt that you could get to 25% gross margins on Model 3, sothat feels like at least a 6- or 9-month delay relative to what you thought a quarter ago. And I'm trying tounderstand what the key drivers are. Is it really the labor for capital substitution? I don't think currencysequentially has changed much. I understand it can be a headwind.

So perhaps you can help us understand what has changed in termsof the gross margin ramp for Model 3 relative to what you thought before. And I have a follow-up, please.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, it's along the lines of what we said in the letter. If we look at the combination of the recently imposedtariffs, Section 232 and countervailing duties plus commodity price increases as well as the weaker dollar,that is adding significant material cost. And then temporarily, we are using more labor. So when youcombine those 2, that's what led to our guidance. And certainly, the material -- the labor cost piece, wewill address and that will come out.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes.

2018/5/2,"Our next question is from Galileo Russell with HyperChange.Galileo RussellTo represent retail investors, I was wondering with Waymo's plans to launch an autonomous taxi service inlimited markets this year if you could give us an update on the Tesla Network and any details surroundingthe launch date or geographic rollout.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectSure. So I mean, that's -- thank you for an interesting question. The launch involve -- where things areobviously going towards is a shared electric autonomy model. So the -- in order for this to -- obviouslyfor the whole sort of system to work, you need all the pieces in place. You need to have full autonomy,full 4 or 5, whatever you want to call it, and obviously a lot of cars in the road and then build the softwareinfrastructure behind that to enable shared autonomy, so to help enable people to share their cars andbe able to offer their cars as effectively kind of a robo Lyft or robo Uber. It's sort of like a combination oflike, I guess, Uber, Lyft and Airbnb type of thing, where you can own your car and have a higher percentusage of an autonomous electric car. You can say it's available generally to anyone who wants to use itwhen you're not using it. You can recall it at will. You can restrict usage to only friends and family or onlyusers who are 5-star. Like this is like the obvious thing that's going to happen. But in order for that to bein place, we have to obviously sell full autonomy, and we're making a really good progress on that front.I believe that the current production of -- the vehicles that we are currently producing are capable of fullautonomy, but the only thing that would really be, like, might be needed or maybe is probably neededis a computer upgrade to have more processing power for the vision neural net. But that's a plug-inreplacement, a thing that can be done quite easily. So I think we're really well positioned and are buildingthe right -- the foundation for a -- having millions, ultimately tens of millions of shared autonomouselectric vehicles. [indiscernible] decide not to share if you don't want to. And then...Galileo Russell 15And specifically on the timing, though, do you have any details about or when we could even expect tolearn more about the timing of this service?Elon R.","Elon R.

2018/5/2,"MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, the hardest thing to predict about the timing is regulatory approval. The thing that's tricky withautonomous vehicles is that autonomy doesn't reduce the accident rate or fatality rate to 0 . It improvesit substantially. But the reality is that even though we think our -- when we think autonomy, even carautonomy reduces the probability of a death by 30%, which would be incredible because this is like, ifapplied broadly, there's over 1 million, I think, 1.2 million automotive deaths per year. And how manydo you read about? Basically none of them. However -- and but if it's an autonomous situation, you --it's headline news. And the media fails to mention that, actually, they shouldn't really be writing thestory. They should be writing a story about how autonomous cars are really safe, but that's not the storyif you want a click on, so they write inflammatory headlines that are fundamentally misleading to thereaders. It's really outrageous. So -- and this would be true like even if electric cars were -- I'm sorry, ifautonomous cars were 10x safer. So instead of 1 million deaths, you have 100,000 deaths, there's stillgoing to be people who will still sue and say, ""Hey, you're responsible for the death here."" And it's like,well, the 90% of people who didn't die are not suing. They're not -- they're still alive. You just don't knowit, so you -- we've got to deal with that. And then obviously regulators respond to public pressure andthe press. So if the press is hounding the regulators, and the public is laboring on misapprehension thatautonomy is less safe because of that -- of misleading press, then this is where I find the things to -- thechallenge of predicting it to be very difficult. And yes, it's really incredibly irresponsible of any journalistwith integrity to write an article that would lead people to believe that Tesla -- that autonomy is less safebecause people might actually turn it off and then die. So anyway, I'm really upset by those.Galileo RussellYes. Really interesting answer.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectI can personally say, from a technical standpoint, I think we'll probably be ready by the end of next year.Galileo RussellAwesome.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, we're definitely going to be improving our Supercharger technology. The thing about a 350-kilowattcharger is it doesn't actually make a ton of sense unless you've got a monster battery pack or have like acrazy high C-rate, in which case your energy density is going to be poor. So it's kind of cockamamie. Yes,I think maybe 200 -- on a -- also I don't know if you meant 350 kilowatts for a single car.

StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, I mean, that -- that's definitely sort of power level that we've discussed and explored. And some ofit also comes down to an optimization around utility versus cost and trade-offs in the car itself. You kindof hinted at that, Elon, but there is a trade-off fundamentally between charge speed and essentially rangeor cost of battery. And we look at that pretty carefully. We understand the trade-off, and we could designcells in the pack that could charge it faster than 300, 400 kilowatts. But it's not a very useful trade-off tothe customer. That's...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectLet's go to understand the difference between energy and power even, really. Energy -- obviously,energy's rate is essentially, at most, a range. And then power is kind of like your peak accelerationbasically, the rate at which you consume energy. So really what -- it's more important to have long rangethan it is to have a superfast charge time.

Fate loves the irony. And-- but they're like suing us because of the way the trucks look, which is absurd. Nobody's buying a Semitruck because of the way it looks or because it's got like a wraparound windshield or whatever, please.So the economics are incredibly important.

That's worked out really well. If you read the articles, it's worked out farbeyond their expectations because the battery's able to respond at the millisecond level, far faster thanany hydrocarbon plant. And so it's value and good stabilization is much greater actually than even a gasturbine plant, which can normally respond quite fast. So it's kind of like you get in a Tesla and you can --you have that instant acceleration. Feels like you like have -- also like a mind meld with the car. It's justlike the car is you. And then that same rapid response is true of the battery pack. So the customers that --the utilities that worked with us thus far have really loved the battery pack.

Yes, I think so.Alexander Eugene PotterPiper Jaffray Companies, Research DivisionSo you think you're pulling ex Accord buyers and Camry buyers into that class, as example?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, we know this because of the trade-ins. So we see quite a wide range of cars [indiscernible] a lot oftrading in the cars. They're not necessarily owners of a C-Class or an Audi A4 or a 3 Series.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerWe saw signs of trade-in with Model S, so with Model 3 it's going to be even more prominent.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, yes, exactly. And I think -- like also, once we get to like the shared autonomy, ride-hailing thing, we-- it could be as soon as the end of next year, but that's already technically ready. But then not long afterthat, I would expect some jurisdictions to give regulatory approval. The effective cost of ownership of aModel 3 or Tesla drops dramatically because you can share that car with others.Alexander Eugene PotterPiper Jaffray Companies, Research DivisionOkay. Very interesting. Last one. You mentioned earlier, you think the Model Y production is going to be atrue sort of production revolution. If you had to do the Model 3 over again, there are some things that youwould have changed, and you hope to incorporate those learnings into the Model Y. What specifically wouldyou do or what specifically do you plan to do?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, I think let's save that for another time. Like we'll talk about that when we unveil the Model Y. But it'sreally going to be dramatically better. The design and production system, I think, really will be next level.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology Officer[indiscernible] bottom line. 24Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectAll right. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Thanks, everyone.

2018/8/1,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Tesla Q2 2018 Financial Results and Q&A WebcastCall. As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director ofInvestor Relations. Mr. Viecha, you may begin.Martin ViechaThank you very much, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2018Q&A Webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk; J.B. Straubel; Deepak Ahuja; Robin Ren, our Head of Sales;Jerome Guillen, our VP of Trucks; and we also have our autopilot team with us here; Andrej Karpathy,Director of AI; Stuart Bowers, our VP of Engineering; and Pete Bannon, our Director of Silicon Engineering.Our Q2 results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differmaterially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filingswith the SEC. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectHi, thank you for joining. First of all, I'd like to say, we're incredibly proud of the Tesla team for producing7,000 Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles in the last week of June. Those were amazing efforts. Sohonored to work with such great team to fuse that incredible result. It's like mind-blowing. We continuedto achieve 5,000 Model 3s per week, 7,000 combined S, X and 3, multiple weeks in July, showing thatwe're able to do this on a sustained basis. And we expect to, in the absence of a force majeure or somevery unexpected events, be able to achieve an average of 5,000 Model 3s or above for Q3, and 2,000Model 3, Model S, X or above per week for Q3 as well. So essentially, 7,000 cars a week, plus for -- onaverage for Q3. So it's an amazing jump from only a year ago when we're producing 2,000 vehicles aweek. It's really kind of a mind-blowing leap forward for a manufacturing company. So yes, it's incrediblework by the team to do that. Many, many late nights, weekends, extreme amounts of effort and lots ofsmart ideas.","This conference call is being recorded.

2018/8/1,"It's amazing.The results you're seeing is that the Model 3 market share has surpassed all competitor premium, mid-sized sedans combined. So Model 3 market share is now a majority. July was a majority of all premiumsedans. That trend is, we think, likely to continue. So it's not -- we do not think it will stop there. I haveRobin Ren here, who's our worldwide Head of Sales, to talk about some of the interesting elements thatwe're seeing in terms of cars that people are trading in, the sales and demand trends. It's looking really,really Positive.We're also getting great feedback from Model 3 from our customers, and we're now delivering theperformance dual-motor and all-wheel drive versions. And the Model 3 reviews are outstanding, reallycouldn't ask for better reviews from some of the toughest critics in the world. And it's -- yes, and just thething that we're recognizing is that the more Model 3s we deliver to the field, it's actually causing viralgrowth of our sales. So we deliver our Model 3 to somebody, they love it, they tell all their friends, theyare actually -- really, our customers are our primary sales force. They love their car and take their friendsfor a drive, and that's the thing that fundamentally drives our sales. 5But not everyone has Model 3, obviously, so we need to get the cars out there for test drives. As it is rightnow, not even all stores in North America have Model 3 for test drives. Of course, we prioritize gettingcars to customers, but we're soon going to have Model 3s available for test drives in all stores, and boththe performance version and the rear-wheel drive version. So a lot of people who will not buy a car untilthey test drive it, just not unreasonable. Although on Sunday, when I delivered it, testing out like directdelivery, which I think is definitely the future, direct delivery from factory to customer's home or work orwherever they are. The guy here who bought it have never actually even sat in a Model 3. I'm like, wow,okay, Mr. Raul, how do you feel about the car now? You haven't even driven it. He's like, ""I love it. It'samazing."" So yes, it seems to be really well-received.Yes, so I'd approximate 7,000 cars a week.","The Model 3 market share has surpassed all competitor premium, mid-sized sedans combined.

2018/8/1,"We believe we can be sustainably profitable from Q3 onwards.We'll try to raise that rate of Model 3 production steadily in the coming quarters and try to get to the10,000 cars a week number as soon we can. What we've found, as we spent a lot of time debugginga wide range manufacturer issues, is that the potential for our existing lines to be able to produce farmore cars is much greater than expected. That by simplifying production lines, by speeding them up, by,in some cases, having things being done manually instead of automatic, and in other cases having bedone automatic instead of manual, we've been able to achieve dramatic improvements to the output ofexisting lines, which means that our CapEx growing from 5,000 cars a week to 10,000 cars a week is atiny fraction. CapEx going 5,000 to 10,000 is a tiny fraction to CapEx needing to grow from 0 to 5,000Model 3s. This is, I think, very good news for capital efficiency of the company. And [indiscernible] that'sgoing to inform future mass market vehicles that we produce.So -- and from an operating plan standpoint, from Q3 onwards, we're going to emphasize, our goal isto be profitable and cash flow Positive for every quarter going forward. Now obviously, if there's a bigrecession or there's a severe force majeure event that interrupts the supply chain, that's not alwayspossible. But we're confident that -- and provided the economy is roughly where it is today, reasonablygood and there's not a big force majeure event that we -- I feel comfortable achieving the GAAP incomePositive and cash flow Positive quarter every quarter from here on out. It's -- I'll just say, there may beoccasional quarters where we'll pay back a big loan or something where there may be -- just because wepaid back a big loan. But absent that, we'd be cash flow Positive.So once again, I thank the team for their incredible work and our customers for their support. Withoutthe great people we have at Tesla and the customers who put their faith in us by buying our product, wewould not be here today. And yes, I've really never been more excited about the future of Tesla. We havea super exciting set of products to bring out in the future. And yes, I mean, sorry if I sound a little tired,I've been working like crazy in the body shop lately.","We believe we can be sustainably profitable from Q3 onwards.

2018/8/1,"But it's really going great. I'm super excited. Somegood people. And a number of the executive team are here. If I could ask the 3 key leaders of the Teslaautopilot team to be here. So I'd like to go from here to see if autopilot leaders at Tesla could introducethemselves and say a bit about what you're working on, what you're excited about in the future. Sorry toput you guys in the spot. But I think we're making pretty radical advances in the core software technologyand the vision neural net, and then, very importantly, the Tesla self-driving trip technology that we'vebeen working on for 3 years is finally coming to fruition. Pete Bannon is going to talk a lot about that. Butit's a plug-in replacement for the existing computer, and enables an order of magnitude improvements inoperations per second or frames per second is the way to think about it.

Yes, I joined team relatively recently. Incredibly excitedkind of to see the foundation the team has built up until this point and building on top of that right now.So right now, a lot of the focus is on Autopilot V9, which is our sort of on-ramp to off-ramp solution that'sgoing to automatically attempt to change lanes, understand what lane the car is in, understand the routethe user wants to travel and take that route for the user and ultimately hand back control to that user injust kind of safe and controlled.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectIntegrated navigation. So you're like, you have to get to one place, you say like -- you just -- by the way,a little tip for -- if you're driving Model S or X or 3, is if you just tap and hold -- tap the navigate buttonand just drag down, it will automatically navigate you to your home or work, depending upon where youare. That's a pretty cool feature.","Elon R. Musk: I think we're making pretty radical advances in the core software technologyand the vision neural net.

2018/8/1,"Yes.Stuart BowersVice President of EngineeringSo yes, a lot of focus right now, we're also kind of digging in on some new safety features. I think,probably the thing that's just most exciting for me coming into the team is just seeing the foundationsbeing built out over the last 2 years. I think, Andrej will talk a lot about some of the perception and visionwork we've done there, including data engine. That has sort of allowed us to build on top of that very,very quickly. And I think we're all starting to see a new set of safety features that really only makes sense.In this world, we have extremely high understanding of tapping around the vehicle. So I think, when Istart to think about what makes me excited about coming to work, it's like, one, starting to introduce realaspects of kind of not just making the kind of reducing the drudgery or kind of the risk of commuting, butalso really making the element fun. And the second is like dramatically improving safety in a way that youreally can only do once you have this like very nuanced understanding of the world around you throughperception.Andrej KarpathyDirector of Artificial Intelligence & Autopilot VisionHello, everyone. My name is Andrej Karpathy, and I'm the Director of AI here at Tesla. In particular, I leadthe vision team, which is responsible for turning the video stream that we receive from all the camerasin the vehicle into an understanding of what is around us and around the vehicle. I work with neuralnetworks for about 10 years, earned my -- mostly as PhD student at Stanford, and as a research scientistin OpenAI, And what I'm really excited about is really building up this infrastructure for computer visionthat underlies all the neural network training, trying to get those networks to work extremely well andmake that really good foundation on top of which we build out all the features of the autopilot, like thefeatures associated with the V9 where really that's going to come up and that Stuart has mentioned.Peter BannonThis is Pete Bannon.

2018/8/1,"They support the current networksrunning today in the car at full frame rates, with a lot of idle cycles to spare. So I think we're all reallyexcited about what Andrej and his team will be able to do with this hardware in the future. I think, likeone little anecdotal story was I gave a talk to his team on hardware 3 last month, explaining how it 7worked and what it was capable of. And then, afterwards, one of the researchers came up to me, he wasreally excited and he said, ""this is so exciting.""So as a hardware designer, having excited software developers is the best. It's a really fun place to workbecause I do get to work with my 2 primary customers, Stuart and Andrej, and making them happy ispretty fun.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectActually, Pete, maybe -- a lot of people know about your background, but not everyone does, so if you canjust like -- Pete's a super humble guy, but if you could just, yes, talk about the stuff you've done before.Peter BannonLet's see, I started working designing computers in Digital Equipment Corporation in 1984, back whenthey were refrigerator-sized, and have been working on smaller and smaller designs ever since. I wasan Intel fellow, working on a team for a little while, then I was VP of Architecture and Verification at PASemi, which was acquired by Apple. I led the design of the first ARM 32-bit processor that went into theiPhone 5. I built the team that designed the first ARM 64-bit processor in the world, which went into theiPhone 5S. And then, I worked on performance modeling and performance improvements at Apple for 8years. And then, 2 years later, I came to Tesla, and designed the neural network accelerator that's part ofhardware 3 and helped architect the rest of the hardware 3 solution that will be in the car next year.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, maybe worth articulating some of the details, what the design principles that -- explain why, at Tesla,AI chip or AI computer essentially for the car is able to achieve order of magnitude better processing thananything else that exists.Peter BannonSure. So like 2 years ago, when I joined Tesla, we did a survey of all of the solutions that were out therefor running neural networks, including GPUs.","Elon R.

2018/8/1,"We went and talked to other people like at ARM that werebuilding embedded solutions for running neural networks, and pretty much everywhere we looked, ifsomebody had a hammer, whether it was a CPU or a GPU or whatever, they were adding something toaccelerate neural networks, but nobody was doing a bottoms up design from scratch, which is what weelected to do. We had the benefit of having the insight into seeing what Tesla's neural networks looked likeback then, and having projections to what they would look like into the future and we're able to leverageall of that knowledge and are willing to totally commit to that style of computing to produce the designthat's dramatically more efficient and has dramatically more performance than what you can buy today.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, thanks. Yes, I mean, essentially, the key is to be able to run the neural net at a fundamental -- ata bare metal level so that you're -- in the circuits, especially when you're the calculations in the circuitsitself and not in some sort of emulation mode, which is how a GPU or CPU would operate. So you want todo basically a mass amount of localized matrix calculations with the memory right there. So it's a hugenumber of very simple complications with the memory needed to straight adjust those complications rightnext to the circuits that are doing the matrix calculations. And the net effect is an order of magnitudeimprovement in the frames per second. Our current hardware, which I'm a big fan of NVIDIA, they'regreat stuff, but using a GPU, primarily, it's an emulation mode. So -- and you also get choked on the bus.So the transfer between the GPU and the CPU ends up being one that constrains the system. So the neteffect is we're able to, with the Tesla computer, we've been in like semi-stealth mode basically for thelast 2 to 3 years on this, but I think it's probably time to let the cat out of the bag because that -- thecat's coming out of the bag anyway. So it's an incredible job by Pete, as seen. It's great, the world's mostadvanced computer for -- designed specifically for autonomous operation.","Elon Musk: The key is to be able to run the neural net at a fundamental -- ata bare metal level.

2018/8/1,"And as a rough sort of figure of 8merit, whereas the current NVIDIA-based hardware can do 200 frames a second, this is able to do over2,000 frames a second, and with full redundancy and fail over. So it's an amazing design and we're lookingto increase the size of our chip team and our investment in that as quickly as possible.I think we're at some of the best days the world, but I think we want to build on it even more. And it'sgoing to cost the same as our current hardware, and we anticipate that this -- they would actually justreplace those replacements, which is why we made it easy to switch out the computer. And that's allthat needs to be done. If we take out one computer and plug in the next, that's it. All the connectors arecompatible, and an order of magnitude more processing.

2018/8/1,"Our first question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionI have one question and one follow-up, please. First, just on gross margins, it looks like S and X grossmargins were up maybe 500 basis points sequentially. And I'm wondering, maybe you can articulatewhat drove that? And then, more importantly, it looks like you're calling for Model 3 gross margins togo from about maybe 3% this quarter to 15% next quarter. That's about a $6,000 cost out per car.And I'm wondering if you can maybe help us understand what sort of the forces that drive that kind ofimprovement in a relatively short time frame?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, absolutely. First of all, I'd like to apologize for being impolite on the prior call. Honestly, I don't thinkthere is really any excuse for bad manners, I was kind of violating my own rule in that regard. So I havesome excuse -- there are reasons for it, I've gotten no sleep and have been working sort of 110-hour,120-hour weeks. But nonetheless, still no excuse. My apologies for not being polite on the prior call.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionI appreciate that. Thank you.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectAnd let's see, with respect to gross margin, I'll touch on that and then hand the rest to Deepak. Butcertainly, when spooling up the production line, there are tremendous amount of inefficiencies. There'sa lot of hurry up and wait where some parts of the production line move well and one part doesn't. Andwe have associates waiting around with nothing to do. There are parts that we thought were right butthen it turns out we've got -- they weren't right and then we send it back to the supplier. It's just like thewhole sort of giant machine kind of -- you just need to have to lurch into a high pace. And there's a lot oflurching, which is very inefficient. So you end up having super high labor cost per car. And it just needs --it takes time to sort of spool up this giant machine. It's a -- basically, a production system is like a giantcybernetic collector. And then, it moves as fast as its slowest part.","Elon R.

2018/8/1,"So as we address those slow parts andas you improve efficiency, then gap -- grow gross margin, and so the profitability of the car just improvesdramatically. That's sort of at a high level. Do you want to add to that?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerNo, you described it extremely well. So just to sort of summarize, this was a major milestone for us in Q2that the gross margin in Model 3 turned slightly Positive. And we feel really good about the path ahead.And as Elon said, it's driven predominantly by manufacturing cost efficiencies. It's the labor hours that weuse to produce each car becomes less, the initial ramp up costs that we have that are one-time as thoseinefficiencies disappear. Our fixed cost that are there, that gets leveraged to a higher volume. So all ofthat.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectActually, a thing that can also happen is that if it turns out that, say, a production part was either designedwrong or built wrong or something wrong with it, then on a kind of emergency basis, we have to go with 10low-volume tooling, which can be produced quickly. But a power producer of a low-volume tooling caneasily be 10x more than a product produced off of production tooling. And so just wanted -- you can have-- and sometimes, it's -- it gets really nutty [indiscernible]. If you got a machine and something happenedout of a block, and it's either that or make a car, but the cost of using low volume, cost of producing low-volume tooling can be really nutty.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd that journey just continues. As we stabilize and grow production from these levels, we achieve evenmore efficiencies. And Q3 also benefits with somewhat improved mix as we're going to sell more all-wheeldrive and performance cars. And in the long run, as we continue to achieve those efficiencies on cost, ourgross margins will continue to increase.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. I mean, I don't know if this trend will continue. We're trying to give you essentially all the informationthat at least we know, but we're seeing roughly half of our customers choose the dual-motor all-wheeldrive option, which is actually quite a good Positive surprise.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, it's been heartening to see that mix in terms of what customers want. And Robin can probably addmore to that.Robin RenYes.","Elon R. Musk: This was a major milestone for us in Q2that the gross margin in Model 3 turned slightly Positive.

2018/8/1,"So starting from end of June, when we opened the configurator and invited the existing reservationorders, we saw tremendous excitement and response from our customers.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. It's -- we don't want to say this should be assumed to be a continued thing. It's just the thing we areseeing now.Robin RenCorrect. And another thing I want to point out is that we are absolutely -- since we opened theconfigurator to the general public in early July, we are seeing an increased demand coming from peoplewho do not currently hold a reservation. I think that's something that we found super exciting becausethese are the people who actually had no idea about Model 3 and they heard about Model 3 as available toorder. Many of them requested test drives. And since early July, we have over 60,000 test drive requestsin the U.S. alone. And these people come into our stores, do the test drive, and they become superexcited and they decide to order a car. So we believe that the strong demand coming from, especially thenon-reservation orders, is going to dramatically increase as we increase our test drive population. To giveyou an example, 3 weeks ago, we had only 8 stores having test drive cars, to Elon's point earlier. Now wehave over 90 stores having test drive cars.Elon R.

And so I did somequick math on the quarter and I see your payables increased by $430 million while your receivable didn'tmove much, which makes sense because you get paid on the spot and you pay your suppliers only on a60-day notice or more. And so if I divide that by the number of incremental cars you've been producingin the quarter, I get to about $23,000 per car. And of course, my question is whether this is a good wayto think about it, which means that going forward, when you move into Q3 and Q4, every additional car,every additional Model 3 you're going to produce, you're going to bump up payables by something in theregion of $20,000, and that's going to be the main driver getting you to breakeven and to stop burningcash.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, Deepak here.

We've been looking forward to this fully autonomous coast-to-coast drive.

And I'm just curious, what's holding back that capability today to go coast-to-coast? And arewe closer now that you've strengthened the compute technology?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, the -- we can do a coast-to-coast drive especially if we pick a specific route and then write code toreally make that route work. We could do a coast-to-coast route drive, but that would be kind of gamingthe system, and I think it's really important for the Autopilot team to be focused on fundamental safety ofthe existing features.

And there'sa dev -- an advanced dev role that can do things like recognize traffic lights and stop signs and makehard right turns and that kind of thing.

I mean, I think, the big thing I'd say is that, Elon, to reiterate Elon's point, there's no question youcan kind of build a demo around the stuff. The challenge right now for the team is just increasing thesafety and utility of Autopilot to over a quarter million cars we have today and pushing more out afterthat. So I think, when we look kind of forward to what the next probably 6 to 12 months look like, it'staking those same kind of features that we've been working on, probably deploying them in the formof active safety features.

Now I know.","Elon R. Musk: Just having that very rapid iteration between design and production is incredibly helpful. We'renow -- we understand, for example, what are the weight limiters and what makes it hard to producebattery modules. And we came up with a new design that achieved the same outcome. It's actually lighter,better, cheaper and we'll be introducing that around the end of this year probably reach volume productionon that in Q1 or something that will -- yes, make that follow up lighter, better and cheaper and achievehigher range.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology Officer: We did this somewhat the first time around, but now there is, I think, even more excitingunderstanding of the value of having those, as Elon said, having the design engineers just workingintimately with automation and line engineers simplifying the process.",,
2018/8/1,"Our next question comes from Tim Higgins for The Wall Street Journal.Tim HigginsA question for you. Do you still plan to make a total of 1 million vehicles in the calendar year of 2020?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectI think so, yes. If it's not a million, it's going to be pretty close. I'd say if it's not a million, it's probably750 or something like that in 2020. We're aiming for a million in 2020, but somewhere between 0.5 millionand 1 million seems pretty likely.Tim HigginsWhere do you get the capacity to do that?Elon R.

2018/8/1,"Our next question comes from Zachary Shahan with CleanTechnica.Zachary ShahanFirst of all, thanks for the recent retweet, Elon. I was really, really impressed with the Model 3 afterowning a Model S, and so I'm really impressed how much you've developed since the early days. My firstquestion was about conquest sales actually. Right before the call, we published an article that Camry saleswere down 22% year-over-year, Prius sales were down 23% year-over-year, and we're very curious howmuch you're pulling from these other cars, other segments. It sounds like you've sort of answered thatquestion at the beginning, but can you give anything in terms of what percentage those top 5 are in termsof trade-in sales and how broad you're pulling? I know you pull from pickup trucks, from sports cars. Canyou speak a little more about the diversity you're pulling from?Elon R.

I'm not sure what the allocationis between top 5 or where it goes beyond top 5. We're just sort of [indiscernible] ask for the top 5breakdown. And it's just interesting that a few are trading up into a Tesla, so they're willing to spendmore money on a Tesla than their current car just based on the trade-in values. I mean, a Civic is a veryinexpensive car compared to a -- particularly the Model 3 today. So that's promising from a market accessstandpoint. But of course, we're going to do the Model Y and compact SUV. We're going to do pickup truck,the Semi, the next-generation Roadster. I mean, we have such awesome ideas and probably the biggestlimiter on our growth is like how fast can we grow battery production and especially cell production on thewholesale supply chain, I think will be the fundamental determinant of Tesla's growth.

Really, really interestingquestions that I cannot actually -- the first one, I cannot -- it gets so much attention where we putproduction, so I cannot answer any like where we're going to put production questions. The -- but will theSemi use a bunch of Model 3 technology, the answer is yes. Jerome, I don't know if you want to elaborateon that or...Jerome GuillenVice President of ProgramsWell, I mean, you can already see in the prototype that we've had virtually out of the Model 3 component,the screen, the door handles, I mean, as much as possible -- yes, the motors, yes, and the prototype a lotof the cell technology. But there are some changes and I'd rather not say it in public, yes. Obviously, it'sgoing to be better than what we showed last year, a lot of improvements. Yes.Galileo RussellOkay. So hopefully, you can talk more about this. With the battery project with PG&E that was recentlyannounced, I'm wondering if you can elaborate how you're prioritizing battery pack between auto andenergy storage. Because it seems like you ramped auto battery packs to 20 gigawatt hours in the past12 months, but are only guiding for about 1 gigawatt hour of Tesla energy installation in the next year.So I'm wondering why is Tesla Energy, given its supply constraints, like why not ramp that supply to 10gigawatts? It seems like the guidance is still below there.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. It's -- as Elon suggested earlier, we are -- essentially, it makes sense for us to prioritize Model 3.But we are adding a ton of capacity, self-capacity, and J.B. could talk more about it, that will enable us todramatically ramp our energy storage business as well in the coming quarters.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. You kind of mentioned only 1 gigawatt hour, but that's a big number in that business, and it's maybeon the order of 300% what we did the prior year.

Initially, it will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn signal before the car movesinto an adjacent lane. Future versions will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement if theychoose to.One area that I'm personally really excited to build on with this improvement is active safety. With theadvancement in neural networks covering 360 degrees of view around our car, we can provide a level ofconstant vigilance that humans just can't. Ultimately, this should allow us to warn, even intervene, for anenormous percentage of modern accidents and to ship these improvements as software upgrades to ourexisting customers.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectAnd we have a lot of -- we see this all the time in the data where the car will do an automatic brakingevent and save a pedestrian or another car from impact.","Elon R. Musk: A lot of people think safety is boring, but not Tesla. So if you look at the -- our blog post, we showed how we handled thecentral fall impact in the front hood. By the way, that's not part of NCAP rating. Just to show how we goover and above the NCAP rated to make sure it's real world safety. That's very important for us.Madan Gopal: Thank you for your decade of hard work and the rest of Tesla safety team. And with that, let's move on toAutopilot and yes, just give an update on sort of Autopilot software, AI and hardware. Yes.",,
2018/10/24,"So it's very important to emphasize like people shouldn't -- it's like -- it seems like people want towait until that comes out, but there's no need to wait until that comes out because it's just a very simpleplug-and-play change to get the full Self-Driving. And anyone who's paid for the full Self-Driving optionwill just get it done for free. And anyone who still wants to order full Self-Driving at this point, it's just anoff-menu item. You can still order it, but we took it off the order -- menu just because there are -- it wasreally creating a lot of friction in the sales process and people didn't understand the difference betweenEnhanced Autopilot and full Self-Driving.So just to simplify the order process, we took that off. But anyone who asks for it can certainly get it.And it really ends up being a discount on future capability. But to be clear, there's definitely no need towait until Q2 to order a car. It's -- we want to make it just a completely seamless process. So there's noadvantage to ordering now versus Q2. Andrej, do you want to...Andrej KarpathyDirector of Artificial Intelligence & Autopilot VisionYes. Thanks. Hi, everyone. I'm Andrej Karpathy, I'm the Director of AI here at Tesla. And my team trainsall the neural networks that analyze the images streaming in from the all the cameras for the Autopilot.For example, these neural networks identify cars, lane lines, traffic signs and so on.The team is incredibly excited about the upcoming upgrade for the Autopilot computer, which Petebriefly talked about. This upgrade allows us to not just run the current neural networks faster. But moreimportantly, it will allow us to deploy much larger, computationally more expensive networks to the fleet.The reason this is important is that it is a common finding in the industry, and that we see this as well, isthat as you make networks bigger by adding more neurons, the accuracy of all their predictions increases 9with the added capacity. So in other words, we are currently at a place where we've trained large neuralnetworks that work very well but we are not able to deploy them to the fleet due to computationalconstraints.So all of this will change with the next iteration of the hardware, and it's a massive step improvement inthe compute capability. And the team is incredibly excited to get these networks out there.Elon R.","Elon: There's no need to wait until Q2 to get the full Self-Driving.

2018/10/24,"MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectGreat. Thank you. And I've said this before, but I think -- let's talk about how we look at the longer-termfuture. We absolutely see the future as kind of -- as sort of shared electric autonomy so that you'll be ableto do ride-hailing or share your car in any way in a sort of long-term model that's some combination oflike Uber, Lyft and Airbnb. So there'll be Tesla-dedicated cars for ride-hailing, and there'll be -- and anycustomer will be able to share their car at will, just like you share your house in Airbnb.So it's a combination of those 2 models. I think it's pretty obvious where things are headed long term. Theadvantage that Tesla will have is that we will have millions of cars in the field with full autonomy capability,and no one else will have that. So I think that puts us -- that will end up putting us in the strongestcompetitive position long term.And then, Laurie, can you finish off with -- let's talk about factory safety.

Our yield on each of the lines across both factoriesimproved significantly. And as we look forward, we see even more opportunities.

2018/10/24,"I mean really, I think -- I honestly feel like the top reason to refer a friend to buy a Tesla is it's goingto keep your friend safe.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionThat's a good reason. If I can just squeeze in since I couldn't ask the first one that you could answer,do you think that the third quarter is a milestone, Elon, where you think Tesla becomes sustainably self-funding and perhaps not in need of outside capital?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, that is our goal. We do not intend to raise equity or debt. At least that's our intention right now. Thatmay change in the future. But the current operating plan is to pay off our debts and not to refinance thembut to pay them off and reduce the debt load and overall leverage of the company. So -- and actually, Ialmost forgot one quite important thing. As -- and this is quite helpful. It's helpful to have these sort ofcrisis situations with logistics, for example. As I dug into the inventory -- like basically finished productinventory from factory to the customer, I was quite surprised to see how long that took and that it wasquite expensive in a lot of cases to get cars to customers. This was something I didn't fully appreciatebefore. And we really have a major initiative at Tesla to get the average time from a car exiting the factoryto receiving the check from the customer, being in the customer's hands, we have to be clear, we can onlyget the check when we give the car to the customer. So getting the car from the factory to a customer,to get that to be as short as possible. In August, the average time in North America to get a car fromthe factory to the customer was 30 days, which is embarrassingly long. By the end of the quarter, we'vereduced it to around 20 days. And our goal in Q4 -- this is a goal, not a promise. But our goal is to getthe average time of a car from the factory to a customer under 10 days. This is a giant improvement inthe capital efficiency of the company because we're making on the order of $75 million worth of productsper day -- of cars per day. So every day, it requires $75,000 -- $75 million worth of capital. So every 10days, it's $750 million.","The top reason to refer a friend to buy a Tesla is it's going to keep your friend safe.

Butthe banks will only loan us 85% of the cost of the vehicle, which translates to about 70% of the priceof the vehicle. So -- and then we've got this loan outstanding, which effectively increases the COGS ofthe car. And it dilutes the company to the tune of 30% of one of the inventory -- of the finished goodsin transit is. So this is really like tightening that and getting that below 10 days in North America andthen also improving dramatically the time -- the transit time to Europe and Asia. It is where like havinglocal factories is actually very important for the capital efficiency of the overall system because I thinkover time, we want to get the time for a car going from a factory to a customer under 7 days worldwide.And then the terms that we have from our suppliers are, on average, just over 60 days. Now our partsinventory management, also there's a lot of room for improvement there. We think we can probably cutthat down to a few hundred million dollars or so, Deepak, something like that, maybe $200 million or$300 million of parts at the factory.

Musk: We want to get the time for a car going from a factory to a customer under 7 days worldwide. And then the terms that we have from our suppliers are, on average, just over 60 days. Now our parts inventory management, also there's a lot of room for improvement there. We think we can probably cutthat down to a few hundred million dollars or so, Deepak, something like that, maybe $200 million or$300 million of parts at the factory. So effectively, what we're going to do is reverse the working capitalrequirement for the company quite dramatically to the point where the faster we grow, the more capitalwe have. It's night and day.Elon Musk: It's really quite dramatic. So -- yes, I think it sort of profoundly changes the financial effectiveness ofTesla.",,
2018/10/24,"Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionI have one for Deepak and then a follow-up, please. Deepak, the OpEx expense management was verystrong in the quarter. I think it was down 13% sequentially, and OpEx was only up 5% year-over-yeardespite revenue growing 71%. So on that front, I mean, in hindsight, did you get too bloated and neededto get more rightsized? And looking forward, how do we think about OpEx growth versus revenue growthon kind of a more normalized basis?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. Tony, so excluding onetime items, our OpEx decreased sequentially by 5%, to just clarify that firstof all. And a lot of that was driven by the actions we took in Q2 to be more efficient with our employeeheadcount. We benefited from that in Q3. And we were really careful in terms of all of our spending. Theother piece that helped us is a lot of our Model 3 spending on expense, sort of, R&D is reducing becauseModel 3 is going into production. So Q2 to Q3, we saw a reduction there. And it just gives you the senseof the leverage of -- the operating expenses can have while our revenue was growing dramatically. So ourOpEx will increase in the future but in a far slower rate, and we will continue to be really, really carefulabout the spending. And I think there are actually more efficiencies than we can find.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWe are going to find them, absolutely.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerRight. So we'll continue down that path.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectDefinitely.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionAnd then to follow up, I was just wondering if you can help us a little bit on the -- back to the grossmargin on Model 3 and the $35,000 car. So this quarter, I impute that Model 3 ASPs were maybe $59,000.And that might suggest that gross margins on a $35,000 Model 3 might be about 0.","Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWe are going to find them, absolutely. Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerRight. So we'll continue down that path. Toni Sacconaghi, Bernstein, Research Division. The next question is a follow-up on the grossmargin on Model 3 and the $35,000 car. So this quarter, I impute that Model 3 ASPs were maybe $59,000. And that might suggest that gross margins on a $ 35,000 Model 3 might be about 0.1%. That's what I'm trying to figure out, Tony. Tony, that's what we're going to try to work with you on, if you want to talk about it more closely. The last question is on OpEx.",,
2018/10/24,"Your next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCWanted to -- just a point of clarification. Elon, you mentioned in August the time to get the car from afactory to a customer was 30 days, down to 20 at the end of the quarter. Your goal is under 10 by the endof 4Q. Where do we see that flow through from a COGS perspective? Is that in automotive gross margin?Or is that in services and other at this point?Deepak Ahuja 22Chief Financial OfficerYes. It's all in automotive gross margin. All logistics costs outbound, it's all in COGS for Automotive.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectOutbound logistics. Yes, I think we'll see a reduction in inbound logistics as well as outbound logistics.Maybe a question is like, for the debt that is carried for that period of time, is that factored into COGS? Oris that not?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThe interest expense of the debt, that's in the interest expense line, okay. It's not in COGS.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectOkay. Yes. That's why I think for the definition of COGS, it should probably be important to includeanything that's directly driven by volume. Essentially, that affects the marginal cost of the vehicle. Soalthough that is not in -- officially in COGS, in my opinion, it probably should be, to take the ABL interestexpense and apply that effectively to the cost of the car.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd from a broader sense, you're looking at it as the cost of doing business, which can be volume.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. Just essentially, the cash flow for everybody increases quite dramatically. Dilution or leverage outsideof the ABL line improves dramatically. And then the de facto cost of -- the effective cost of the car alsoreduces because you do not have the interest expense. If you have interest expense over 20 days versus10 days, this is a big difference.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCUnderstood. I appreciate that clarification. Sort of what I was trying to get at, you've been running inNegative gross margin in services and other for several quarters now. And wanted to get a sense for whenthat could maybe trough and start to turn the corner and to generate some profit for you. I understandthere's a lot of building out going on for sales, service and charging infrastructure.","The time to get the car from afactory to a customer was 30 days, down to 20 at the end of the quarter.

2018/10/24,"Our final question comes from Phil LeBeau with CNBC TV.Phil Lebeau 24Elon, quick question. In terms of as the federal tax credit seems to be phased out as your sales crossover the threshold, what kind of an impact have you guys modeled into how much that might slow downpotential sales?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWe don't expect this to result in -- I mean, the sales tax -- or the tax incentive in the U.S. drops in half inthis quarter. But then we also start shipping to Europe and then start shipping to Asia. And we certainly donot expect anything that would cause our production to drop below, let's say, a minimum of 5,000 cars aweek.Phil LebeauBut in terms of in the United States, do you expect that it'll slow down demand and sales within the U.S.?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectI think that as we're able to offer lower-cost versions of the car, that we would expect demand to sustainin the U.S. But I want to be clear. It's not like we're holding back this lower-cost version of the carintentionally. It's just like with -- it's like is there anything we can do to provide a lower-cost car now,and that's where we came up with the depopulated long-range pack just like basically taking -- havinga long-range pack with fewer cells. Like we really care about providing the end customer with the mostaffordable car that we can possibly produce, the best viability. And if we could do the smaller pack now,we absolutely would. It's just going to take us, I don't know, at least 3 months to get the productiongoing and you got to [ spool up ] production. And that production is going to go to -- we're going to makethe packs. The packs are going to go to the vehicle factory. We've got the cars that we're going to getdelivered to customers. So that's why customers probably see the smaller battery pack on the order of likeMarch or something, or February maybe. It's something on that order. And one thing -- these do triggerpoints that are worth bearing in mind. As our quarterly letter indicates, the Model 3 has the -- is the mostefficient energy per mile electric vehicle out there. It's got the best efficiency.","Elon R. Musk: We don't expect this to result in -- I mean, the sales tax -- or the tax incentive in the U.S. drops in half inthis quarter.

2018/10/24,"So we've got the best interms of miles or kilometers per kilowatt hour, and we also have the lowest cost per kilowatt hour. Thismakes it very difficult for other companies to compete with Tesla because we're the most efficient carand the lowest-cost batteries. So I do encourage our competitors to really make a huge investment. Andwe've been saying that for a long time. And then they are only in this competitive disadvantage becausethey didn't -- we try to help them as much as we could and they didn't want to take our help. So they canuse all our patents for free. We have -- they can use our Supercharger network if they can just have anadapter for our -- connector or something. We want to be as helpful as possible to the rest of the industry.The fact of the matter is we made the investment in the Gigafactory and other companies didn't.

2019/1/30,"Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Tesla, Inc. Q4 2018 Financial Results andQ&A Webcast. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.I would like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director of InvestorRelations. Mr. Viecha, you may begin.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2018 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and a number of otherexecutives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter wepublished at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectThanks, Martin. Last year was definitely the most challenging year in Tesla history, but also themost successful. Thanks to the incredible work of the Tesla team, Model 3 became the best-sellingpremium vehicle in the U.S. for 2018. And in fact, when considering battery electric vehicles, Teslaachieved an 80% market share of U.S. sales in the last year. I think this point is perhaps not wellappreciated. All other electric vehicles combined were 20% of sales in the U.S. in last year. So Ithink that's not bad.We also delivered -- also made vehicles last year as we did in all prior years combined, which is atremendous achievement by the Tesla team. The -- if you track Tesla vehicle production year-over-year, cumulative sales deliveries year-over-year, it is about the cleanest exponential I've ever seen.We've basically almost doubled our fleet every year. Every year, we make as many cars as we did inall prior years. So this is a very unusual thing to see for -- especially for a large complexmanufactured object. I think it may be the fastest that a complex manufactured object like a car hasgrown in history, or at least I'm not aware of anything that is faster. Martin, are you -- do you...?Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRI'm not sure.","Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and a number of otherexecutives will be on the call. The conference is being recorded. Martin Viecha, Senior Director of InvestorRelations, will lead the way.

2019/1/30,"I think Model T was a little bit slower, but I'm not 100% sure.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect Okay. And we expect that exponential to continue. So with the deliveries this year being -- even inthe face of -- if there's a global recession -- even if there's a global recession, we're expectingdeliveries this year to be about 50% higher than last year. And this -- it could be a lot more thanthat. But even with tough economic times, to receive 50% growth is pretty nutty.Over Q4, we achieved GAAP profitability for the second quarter for the first time in the companyhistory, and we increased our cash on hand by more than $700 million, even after paying debt,ending the year with a total of $3.7 billion of cash. This means we have enough cash to settle ourconvertible bond that will mature in March.In addition, our operating margin remains strong at 5.7%. Operating margins in the fourth quarterare usually lower in the automotive industry, but this was not the case for Tesla.2019 is going to be an amazing year for Tesla. As I mentioned, we're expecting to increase sales by50%. Perhaps it could be a lot more than 50%, but I think 50% is a very reasonable number. Butthat's crazy growth for the automotive industry.I want to note that one of our major priorities this quarter is improving service operations. So really,from my standpoint, when I think about what my priorities are this quarter, it's improving service inNorth America. That's #1. And I think there are some very exciting initiatives we're going to rollout with regard to that. We're going to get cars to China and Europe and make sure that we havegood logistics for the whole delivery process, from factory gate to the customer. That's obviouslypretty far from California to get to Europe and China and then get to -- get product to ourcustomers. So we're working every aspect of that logistics chain. And I think we've -- I think it'sgoing to be good.I'd say at this point, I'm optimistic about being profitable in Q1. Not by a lot, but I'm optimisticabout being profitable in Q1 and for all quarters going forward.So let's see, we've opened 27 new store and service locations, bringing our total locationsworldwide to 378. And we increased our Mobile Service fleet to 411 vehicles.","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product Architect Okay.

2019/1/30,"The Mobile Servicefleet is something we can scale up very rapidly, because we don't need bricks and mortar. We canget more vehicles, hire people and deploy rapidly. It also actually results in higher customersatisfaction, because we can actually send one of our service vans to your work or home and fix thecar without you having to bring it into a service center or do any paperwork or anything like that.It's really seamless, invisible, the customers love it.And we're also increasing the functionality of the Tesla App for service, so that instead of having tomake an appointment, to call and make an appointment, you can just open your Tesla App, say youwant to make a service appointment, and it lists the top 10 most frequently requested service items,and you can, with a couple of taps, you've made your service appointment. And we're going tomake it easier for the car to be picked up and dropped off as well. So if you want -- if you prefer notcoming to the service center at all, you can just request that the car be picked up and delivered.That's something that we'll be -- so that's already been rolled out and have a big improvement tocustomer satisfaction. That rolled out 2 or 3 weeks ago.But the next thing we're going to add is, if your car detects something wrong, like a flat tire or adrive unit failure, that before the car has even come to a halt, there is a tow truck and a serviceloaner on the way. So the car has already notified Tesla emergency services, and a service loaner, atow truck, are on their way before your car has even come to a stop. Now this will be immense inimproving customer happiness. Basically, it'll just call it and you'll have to tap the center screen tocancel it. So you can cancel it if you want. We just have to -- it's like automatically going to happen,you just press cancel.We're also improving product distribution. So I think we made a strategic error in the past about nothaving service parts located at our service centers. We had them in product distribution warehouses,which basically meant it was impossible to have a fast turnaround on servicing a car, because thecar would come in, then the parts will be requested, they come to the service center, this wouldbasically -- even for a very simple repair, could take days.","The Mobile Servicefleet is something we can scale up very rapidly, because we don't need bricks and mortar.

2019/1/30,"So we're going to be able to stock in allcommon parts at the service centers, so that it's possible to -- and first of all, have -- get your carserviced in 20 minutes or 15 minutes, even, if it's a simple matter. I mean, it should be like JiffyLube, like 8 minutes or whatever, not 8 minutes, that's -- it should be like lightning fast. But inorder to do that, we have to have the parts located at our service centers.Also, it's going to make sense for our service centers to do basic body work or essentially, if all youneed to do to is replace a front or rear fascia, it makes sense to just pre-stock the front and rearfascia in the common colors. So unless you have an unusual color, we can literally replace yourfascia in 15, 20 minutes, and there's none of this, like, weeks at a body shop stuff.Let's see, in terms of the new products, with Model Y , we've completed [ensuring] of and design ofModel Y , and the products are -- the tooling that's going out for production of Model Y , 3/4 of theModel Y is common with the Model 3, so it's a much lower CapEx per vehicle than Model 3. Andthe risk is also quite low. This is in contrast to Model S versus Model X, where the theory was -- Ithink Model X, we just -- it's like sort of Model X to be like sort of the Faberg???© egg of cars. It's a-- it's an incredible vehicle and probably one -- probably nothing like it will ever be made again,and maybe it shouldn't. But it is a work of art. It's a special work of art. But the commonality withthe Model S is limited. It was only about maybe 30% in common with the Model S, whereas ModelY is, I think, 76% or something like that, in common with the Model 3. And we're most likely goingto put Model Y production right next to -- in fact, as part of our main Gigafactory in Nevada. So itwill just be right there, batteries and powertrains will come out and go straight into the vehicle. Sothat also reduces our risk of execution and reduces the cost of having to transfer parts fromCalifornia to Nevada.","3/4 of the Model Y is common with the Model 3, so it's a much lower CapEx per vehicle than Model 3.

2019/1/30,"It's not a for-sure thing, but it's quite likely, and it's our default plan.I would expect Model Y will probably be -- the demand for Model Y will be maybe 50% higherthan Model 3, could be even double. The -- as I understand it, the mid-sized SUV segment is the,worldwide, is the most popular type of vehicle. So we'll probably see a higher volume of Y than 3.And earlier this month, we started construction of Gigafactory Shanghai, and by the end of thisyear, we expect to be producing Model 3s using a complete vehicle production line. That's body,paint, final assembly, general assembly and module production. So it basically would be -- thisshould be extremely fast. I get like daily updates of progress of the Shanghai Gigafactory, and thosefactories are going to go up like lightning. So we do feel quite confident at this point, at least for thefactories that are in our control, that we can achieve volume production in Shanghai by the end ofthe year. And that should allow us to get to the 10,000 vehicles a week rate, or very close to it, bythe end of the year.And yes, I think that's it.","The demand for Model Y will be maybe 50% higherthan Model 3, could be even double.

2019/1/30,"Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay, great. So we're going to take the first questions from our retail investors who have beensubmitting their questions on say.com. So the question that has been submitted has been aboutservice, which I think you already spoke at length about. So let's go to the second question.The second question would be, how are you feeling about demand right now across the productline? Is 500,000 to 700,000 units at $42,000 ASP still a realistic annual target for Model 3, evenconsidering Model Y and its impact on demand? And do you continue to see S and X demand of100,000 annually?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI mean, my best guess, this is just a guess, my best guess for demand of Model 3 worldwide issomething -- in a strong economy, is something on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year.That's my best guess for demand of Model 3 in a strong economy. If the economy goes into arecession, then I think that could be something on the -- 40% less. But I think even in a recession,worldwide demand is still something in the order of 500,000 for Model 3. For S and X, we dideliminate the 75 kilowatt hour version of S and X and to provide more differentiation relative to 3and then Y that's coming out. I think we could see a slight decline in total vehicles, but I think thenet cash flow from S and X is likely to be very similar. So probably no major change in net cashflow for S and X.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The next question from Alex is, can you please share an update on full self-driving and TeslaNetwork development? When will customers start to see full self driving features? What's the bestcase time line for Tesla Network to go live?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectSure. We -- we already have full self-driving capability on highway. So from highway on-ramp tohighway exit, including passing cars and going from one highway interchange to another, full selfdriving capability is there. In a few weeks, we'll be pushing an update that will allow the option ofremoving stalk confirm in markets where regulators approve it, which we believe that will be thecase in the U.S., for example.","The second question would be, how are you feeling about demand right now across the productline?

2019/1/30,"So maybe we'll take the last question from retail investors, which was, where will Tesla Semiand Model Y be produced? Can you share a time line on expected production ramp of theseproducts?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI was mentioning earlier, the Model Y , we think, most likely will be produced at Gigafactory, butthat's -- unless we encounter some obstacle -- that's the default plan that we're proceeding towards.And it's fast, lower risk and relatively low CapEx. In terms of the -- I mean, probably there's likeinitial production of Model Y , very low volume, early next year. But then it always takes time toramp up any production system, and it's difficult to predict the shape of that S-curve. So we feelconfident in saying there will be production volume of Model Y by the end of next year. But inbetween beginning of next year with low volume, it always starts with very low, and then it growsexponentially, from beginning of last year to end of next year, it's difficult to predict that ramp.

Brinkman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division - Senior Equity Research AnalystI see in the letter the amount that you have spent on land for Gigafactory Shanghai in theclassification operating cash flows. Is there any guidance you can provide us in terms of how tothink about CapEx for this facility going forward? And can you discuss the source of funds for theproject? I think you've spoken in the past about the potential to raise debt locally in China. Is thatstill your thinking? And what kind of terms might you be able to raise that capital?Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOYes, Deepak here. You're right. The purchase of the land is a 50-year lease with the government ofChina. So it's not CapEx, but it's operating lease that shows up as cash flow from operations.However, the CapEx that we will invest is our equipment, and we fully own it. So that will show upas capital expenditures. The plan, as we have indicated in the letter, is still to get funding for amajority of debt capital spending from local China banks. And we expect pretty attractive ratesbased on the dialogue we've had. And there's a lot of interest. And we hope to finalize that and thenshare the details at that point.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, I mean, as a ballpark figure, probably it's something about -- something in the order of $0.5billion in CapEx to get to the 3,000 vehicle rate in Shanghai, ballpark figure. And as Deepak wassaying, we've been offered very competitive debt financing in China, really extremely compellinginterest rates, so we do not expect that to be a capital drain on the company.Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOYes, these are the biggest banks in the world, and for them, $500 million is not a large amount ofmoney in the scheme of things.","Elon R.

But also, very important isautonomy. This has the potential to save millions of lives, tens of millions of serious highwayinjuries and give people their time back so that they don't have to drive, they can -- if you're on theroad, you can spend time doing things that you enjoy instead of being in terrible traffic.

And just to clarify, when you're sort of talking about the outlook for 2019, the numberof deliveries up 50% and then the margin target for Model 3 to get to 25%, does that assume thatyou're introducing a lower range, the short-range Model 3 at some point during the year?Elon R.

Galves - Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research & Senior AnalystDo you plan to offer a U.S. lease product for Model 3 in the U.S.? When can we expect it? And canyou talk about what percentage of S and X have historically been leased in the U.S.?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectWell, we've been reluctant to introduce the leasing on Model 3 because of how -- of its effect onGAAP financials. So it is worth noting that demand to date is with 0 leasing. So obviously, leasingis a way to improve demand, but it has -- it makes our financials looks worse. So we're like -- we'renot wanting to introduce that right away. I mean, we'll introduce it sometime later this yearprobably. What -- I'm not sure the percentage of lease is for S and X right now.Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOIt's around 20%, low 20s, and it stayed stable at that level for many, many quarters, which is -- itseems like the natural demand because we don't do subvention or artificially bump up...Elon R.

And is it included in your expectation ofa small profit?Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOYes, it is included in that. It's difficult to say exactly what that is.

Incorporated, Research Division - SeniorResearch AnalystI have 1 question and it's got 4 parts to it. Happy new year, Elon. So the first part is, so our Streetnumbers, like consensus, we've gotten everything wrong for 6 years or 7 years since you wentpublic, and there are about $6 in earnings. Talk to us about that if you can. Number two, Elon, couldyou talk to us about -- can you talk about -- I hear you cut some workforce at SpaceX and there atTesla and I feel that you have a worry about global economy. Can you talk to us about how you feelabout that with your guidance in order -- in the same order? And then can we talk about, maybe forthe third thing, for JV , no one's ever going to talk about stationary storage, but we got a whole pageon that, which looked pretty good to me, and what should we be focusing on that? And what canthat add to the bottom line on top of that $6 this next year?Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOI mean, we can't really, Ben, talk about consensus and what that means. I think we are -- maybe thebetter approach is we are providing certain guidance here and you and the other analysts need toreflect that in your modeling.

All Tesla cars being built today have all the hardware necessary for fullself-driving, and over the year updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailingnetwork fleet and generate income which, as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago, we think issomewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 a year, in some cases, perhaps more. We're the onlycompany in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chipfor full self-driving. We're in a position unlike anyone else in the industry. And in 2020, we expectto have 1 million robotaxis on the road with the hardware necessary for full self-driving.

2019/4/24,"Last quarter,we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North Americaexperienced last year as well as a massive increase in delivery volume to China.As far as challenges go, this was a good one to have because we booked vehicles and consumersbought them, but this rapid increase in overseas volume strained our logistics operation and resultedin over half of our global deliveries occurring in the final 10 days of Q1.This was the most difficult logistics problem I've ever seen, and I've seen some tough ones. So I'llsay it again, equipment fleet delivered the half of all vehicles produced -- delivered all half -- alldeliveries occurred literally in the final 10 days of Q1. As a result, a large number of vehicles -- the vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2 which, of course, Q1net income to be Negatively impacted. As we said, we could not get the vehicles to customersspecifically in time. In response to this, we are in the process of regionally balancing our vehiclebooked throughout the quarter. This will make the -- this will put much less strain on Tesla, resultsin a much better delivery experience for customers and have a very Positive effect on our workingcapital in the middle of the quarter.In Q1, Model 3 was yet again the best-selling premium car in the U.S., outselling the runner-up byalmost 60%. It's worth to dwell on that for a moment, just how absurd this is compared topredictions that were made several years ago. There were literally, to the best of my knowledge, 0predictions that this would happen, if you go back just even 5 or 6 years ago, that an electric carwould be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe, over time, we'll be the best-selling premium car throughout the world.And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever. Andthat'd be something similar in Switzerland as well. So these were really incredible achievements bythe Tesla team.Since the introduction of Standard Range and Standard Range Plus, nearly 70% of trade-ins fromModel 3 have actually been nonpremium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car thanthey have ever paid for a car.","Last quarter,we experienced a massive increase in delivery volume in Europe, similar to what North Americaexperienced last year.

2019/4/24,"They never anticipated paying this much for a car, but because theywant the Model 3 more than they ever wanted a vehicle, they're willing to pay more to get a Model3.And keep in mind, global expansion for the Model 3 has just begun, and this segment is vastlylarger internationally than it is in the U.S. We're continuing to make significant improvements to ourvehicle lineup, including updating the Model S and X production line to accommodate the nextgeneration of powertrains. So we announced this yesterday and we are now in production with thesignificantly more balanced powertrains for the Model S and X as well as an upgrade to thesuspension system to have active adaptive damping in the suspension system and to enable chargingat 200 kilowatts, which is -- and there are a number of other small changes. If anyone is thinkingabout upgrading their Model S or X, this is a great time to do it. And we also introduced the loyaltyprogram where if somebody has -- is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance Model Sor X, they get the Ludicrous upgrade for free. So this is -- yes, as a thank you and an appreciation toexisting Tesla customers.So they have a longer range. The Model S now has a range of 370 miles. This is actually EPA rangeof 370 miles, and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop all the way fromSan Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds. And they said they could have even gonefaster. And there weren't any headwind as well. So this is pretty remarkable that an electric carcould go nonstop between the 2 biggest cities in California. I mean, I remember back when I wasdriving gasoline cars, I always had to stop at a gas station. This is literally better than a gasoline carwith the rare exception. And there's also an increase in power. It accelerates faster. Just better, betterin every way. And we're able to this without increasing the size of the battery pack, which is atestament to the powertrain team for it to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain bysuch a significant margin.So with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continuedexpansion of Model 3 globally, we expect our order rate to increase significantly throughout theyear and commensurate with our production levels.","The Model S now has a range of 370 miles, and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop all the way fromSan Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds.

2019/4/24,"And in terms of other products, I'm very excitedabout the future for other products, especially for full self-driving, which will fundamentallytransform transport as we know it; the Tesla Semi truck; Model Y; improvements to Powerwall;Powerpack; the Solar Roof version 3 on the energy side. And no question in my mind that Tesla hasthe most exciting product road map of any consumer product company in the world.And finally, I want to thank our employees for their incredible work and our customers for theircontinued support.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, Elon. And I think Zach -- Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, thank you, Martin, and thanks, Elon, as well. Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, thiswas one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in the history of the company. And itwas ambitious even by Tesla's own standard. The global expansion of Model 3 was a huge themewithin the quarter. We launched the Standard Range lineup for Model 3, product retooling forModel S and Model X, which Elon just talked about with the range enhancements and suspensionupgrades, and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and worked to do thecorresponding impact that had on our order mix in deliverable cars. So there's 2 key themes that I'dlike to discuss briefly, and then we'll open it up to Q&A, around cash and profitability for thequarter.First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. Thiswas a $1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to 2factors. The first is that we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1. Note for those of youlooking to the cash flow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows.The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact ofexpanding Model 3 operations overseas. And the 2 components to this which we have discussed, isthat an international operation naturally commands additional working capital because of transittimes, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not all of our cars will bedelivered. Both of these factors which occurred in Q1 we do not expect to repeat in Q2.","Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, Elon.

2019/4/24,"And weexpect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going forward. I'll also note thatwe're tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries for a month 1 in the history of thecompany.On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10days of the quarter. This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarterand then U.S. local builds in the second half. This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEAand China and significantly stressed the delivery operations. Note, we also faced import issues inShanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries towards the finalcouple of days and weeks in the quarter. So we're addressing this by regionally on balance -- bybuilding regionally balanced, and we've already executed on this for Model 3, and S and X will beimplemented in the next week or 2.The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter. Sowe don't have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the peak. We expectsignificant cost savings to come from this.On the P&L side, we incurred $188 million of one-time adjustments that flowed through to netincome. $120 million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced onFebruary 28. This included a reserve for a potential increased return rate for our Residual ValueGuarantee and Buyback Guarantee of vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of ourused Tesla inventory and service deliveries. There's an additional $67 million related to Q1restructuring and other charges that flowed through.Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue wasNegatively impacted by $501 million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline indeliveries.Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately 28 -- to20%. This is due to 2 factors. One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February 28 as wellas a mix shift towards the Standard Range lineup which we launched. We also successfullyexecuted on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact.","50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10 days of the quarter.

2019/4/24,"Labor content, warehousing andscrap, as examples, all had double-digit improvements from Q4 to Q1.In spite of launching the Standard Range variance, we want to note that North American ASPs areclose to $50,000, with the majority of our orders being for long-range variants of Model 3.In S and X, the impact on margin was more significant. Two major pieces here: the volumereduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our margin as well as thepricing actions that we took on February 28. Even though S and X had been in production for awhile, we still continue to make operational improvements there, the labor content as an example,which improved quarter-over-quarter.As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon's sentiments about the excitement of our productlineup. But from a financial standpoint, what we've effectively done here is build an incredible baseof knowledge and assets that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around theworld.So Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this. As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing upcapacity 50% for Giga Shanghai as compared to the Model 3 in the U.S., and that 50%, our internalforecast that we're executing against, is actually better than that.And Model Y , as we've noted, is built on the Model 3 platform, so we're able to leverage theknowledge there for capital-efficient expansion.In energy as well, as we've noted previously, 2019 is a big year for storage, so a lot of excitingimprovements coming there. And the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilizesome of the assets that we've made investments in that.So just to conclude the opening remarks here, I've personally never felt more excited about thefuture of the company, and I'm looking forward to the discussion.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, Zachary.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectSure. The challenge really is battery cell scarcity. As far as the stationary storage is concerned, webasically need an upsell to support the vehicle production as well as to both Powerwall andPowerpack. Last year, in order to have enough cells for Model 3, we actually had to convert all ofthe lines of the Gigafactory to produce cells just for the Model 3 as opposed to Powerwall,Powerpack. And so we're essentially scrounging cells from all around the world to, at least,continue some level of production on the Powerwall and Powerpack.

This year, we think that we'll be able to allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of cell outputs.Jeffrey B. Straubel - Tesla,. Inc - CTOBetween 5% and 10%, exactly that. The next question is, Elon, most people when they think of Tesla onlysee it as an automotive company. Can you speak to the energy side of the company, specifically theroad map for when you see theenergy side of things really taking off and generating",,
2019/4/24,"So there are far fewer cells in a Powerwall than in a car, so that translates to quite a decentnumber of Powerwalls. And then we will continue to use cells from various suppliers around theworld. The Powerwall and Powerpack, because they don't have to go through vehicle homologation,are much more adaptable to using a variety of cells from other cell providers. So are we expectingthat Powerwall and Powerpack to see a very significant percentage growth this year, maybe on theorder of 300% or some quite high number. Sorry? Sorry? Yes, 300%. I guess he was just confirmingit, 300%. So this is a very big percentage growth rate. It's much faster than an automotive. So overtime, we would expect that to -- that sort of growth rate we hope will be able to continue and thenbattery storage will become a bigger and bigger percentage of Tesla's business over time. We alsohave -- we're also planning a significant increase in retrofit solar this year because we've finallyrefined the product offering to be something that's extremely compelling and much more costefficient to deliver and install. So a radically streamlined process from what has been done before,and we'll have more to say on that possibly next week. And then the Solar Roof tile, we're onversion 3 of the design. That necessarily takes a while to scale up because we have to be confidentthat the Solar Roof is going to last for on the order of 30 years and because the warranty is sort of20, 25 years. And so the rate at which you can iterate on Solar Roof is necessarily slowed down bythe -- according to the rate which you can do accelerated aging on the roof. And we want theinstallation process to be simple and easy. So I was just actually at the Buffalo -- Tesla Buffalofactory a few weeks ago and I was pretty impressed with the team, and we're looking forward toscaling that up significantly through the balance of this year and next.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much.

How soon should current owners that purchased FSD getthe new FSD computer?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI think the -- from features and functionality standpoint, I think there's no point getting the FSDupgrade if you don't really have it in the car for probably about 2 or 3 months. That's when we'llstart releasing features that are materially different from the feature set available on the version 2hardware. So just no need to rush to the -- get your computer replaced. It's like 2 to 3 months beforeit becomes relevant. And then it will obviously increase rapidly from then. One other comment I'llmake in case, since nobody asked this explicitly. For Model Y production, we are right now tryingto decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California or Nevada, and we expect tomake a final decision on that very soon. But in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling andequipment required for Model Y . So we don't expect this to, in any way, delay production of ModelY , but it's currently a very close call between Nevada and California as to whether we do the ModelY at Giga or at Fremont.

Canyou talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth? And in particular what theorder book or reservation list may be telling you?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes. The -- we do see strong demand for vehicles, the -- both S, X and 3. The Standard Range PlusModel 3 with Autopilot included at $39,500 is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and affordableto probably something on the order of like the top 40% income earners in the U.S. and Europe. Soit's -- I think we'll see a lot of interest and demand in that. We are. And then with the upgraded Sand X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X upgrade, and thisreally is kind of a game changer of an upgrade. So I think we are seeing an uptick in demand, andwe expect to see that to be quite significant. So -- and we're also out of the seasonality of Q1 with afew people just generally don't like buying cars in winter, and we're getting past the overhang ofthat tax credit cliff which, for us, ended in the U.S. on December 31. So these were all very Positivefactors. We also have just a lot of markets where there's -- where we haven't yet tapped intodemand, especially for Model 3.

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureMy first question is really on the Model S and Model X and, Elon, you say you're comfortable withthem. You see -- based on what you saw in April, do you think that the 25,000 units per quarter isthe level of demand that is where you see the market coming back already? Or are we not there yet?And more specifically, in the U.S., the pull forward in Q4 could hurt a lot of demand for S and X? Isthat something that you still see in the numbers today in recent weeks? Or is that behind us? And I'llhave a follow-up on Q2.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes. I mean, I think something like the -- returning to the 100,000 a year annualized demand for Sand X is what we anticipate. That's to the best of my knowledge.

But we think it is important tounwind this wave because it ends up being sort of optimizing for 1 quarter, but really adding a lot ofcost and difficulty and not just -- not being a good experience for customers and putting great stresson the Tesla team.

2019/4/24,"Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystElon, I was wondering if you could talk about this whole notion of raising capital. For about the lastyear, you sort of eschewed it as almost an evil thing, and I think a lot of investors believe that thecompany might be better served in its growth aspirations if it did raise capital or had a stronger cashbase. And given that you used up about $2 billion worth of cash in the quarter, aren't you potentiallytrying to go through a very thin space while trying to grow quickly and be self-funding, which,quite frankly, may be unrealistic?

So that in that sense, I think it's just -- it's important to have a strong financial disciplineof the company and just -- to make sure we don't have extraneous expenses and that we're just beingfrugal with capital. If we just keep raising capital every time, then it just takes -- we don't have theforcing function for improving the fundamental operation of the business.

2019/4/24,"Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.Joseph Robert Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - AnalystFirst question is really just a clarification on -- in the outlook of 25% non-GAAP gross margin thatyou're targeting. Is that over the mid-term? Or is that something you expect to hit by the end of thisyear? And if so, what gets S and X back higher given the price cuts?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, this is Zach here. That guidance that we're targeting for the end of the year. Althoughinternally, we're working towards S and X non-GAAP gross margin achieving that sooner. Thebiggest lever there is actually 2 components. One is, as we increase volume back on our S and Xproduction line, there's just a natural benefit there from the fixed cost absorption which will help us.But we also have a number of cost reduction projects in place that we're executing on over thecourse of the year. And then the third piece which applies to S and X, but also Model 3, we'reseeing an increased take rate on our full self-driving offering. And there are revenue deferralsassociated with that given that the full suite of functionality is not there. And as that option becomes-- approaches sees us continually roll out more, we will be able to have more revenue on that. Andso all of these things together within our internal plans gives us confidence.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, we should -- I should mention that the upgraded powertrain for S and X was actually results ina significant cost down because we essentially took the high volume rear-drive units of the Model 3,which is extremely efficient but [the same magnet motor and power] electronics already in it and wemade a version for that -- of that for the front-drive unit of S and X. And so we're actually able toget a cost reduction while improving range and performance of the car. That's just one example.Joseph Robert Spak - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division - AnalystOkay. And the second question is just looking at the 10-K, you've continually noticed $4.9 billionpurchase obligation, which I think is primarily related to Panasonic Giga 1. And then Elon, in someof your communication, you've indicated production constraints.","Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, this is Zach here.

2019/4/24,"Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director in the General IndustrialsGroup and AnalystI mean, it sounds like from the tone of the call that you don't see that there's a demand issue forsome of the product, but margins seem to be under pressure and typically automakers stop pricingwhen there is a demand issue. So what is the logic of the price cuts during the quarter?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI mean, our goal, as we've been very clear about from beginning of the company, is to make ourcars as affordable as possible. And we thought it was important to offer the $35,000 Model 3 andthen to create a sort of bundled package for the Model 3 with the increased range because we thinkactually that difference between 220 and 240 is quite important, the more point people realize inrange and having a posher premium interior and then finally, Autopilot. So we thought those -- [likewe went and paired like] product that's really just nailed the sweet spot, which I think the $39,000 --$39,500 Model 3 is just really nailed the sweet spot and we're seeing consumer responseaccordingly. People can still buy the $35,000 version of the Model 3 that, of course, didn't haveAutopilot and has a software range restriction, that kind of thing. It's like slightly more inconvenientto buy. You just have to make a phone call or visit a store. So it's just not like you have to completethe obstacle course or something. But we see very few people actually taking us up on that $35,000offer, but it is there and will remain there.Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director in the General IndustrialsGroup and AnalystAnd as a follow-up, you're still targeting the China facility ramp by the end of the year. Are you stillconfident in the 3,000 per week? And do you have a battery supplier yet that's getting pretty close tothat point?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, the Shanghai Gigafactory progress is going incredibly well, a testament to the outstandingexecution of our team on the ground there.

As a reminder, this conference may berecorded.I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Senior Director of Investor Relations, MartinViecha. Sir, you may begin.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Latif, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2019 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of otherexecutives.Our Q3 results were announced at about 1:45 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter we published atthe same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So last quarter, we delivered more than 95,000 vehicles, which is a record for Tesla. Putthat in perspective, it's nearly an 80% increase in deliveries compared to the second quarter of lastyear. I think it's sometimes hard for people to appreciate when you have a large manufactured itemwith a complex global supply chain just how difficult that is. I'm incredibly proud of the Tesla teamfor being able to do that.I think this level of growth is possibly unprecedented. It might be the fastest that any large complexmanufactured item has grown in history. So just, I think, really great work by the Tesla team toachieve that outcome, and we expect growth to continue in the future at -- for several years to comeat the 50% to 100% level. So as I said, I think that is not well appreciated how the quotas grow atthat rate.But achieving record number of deliveries is an important milestone and shows the rapid progresswe've made in managing a global logistics and delivery operation at high volume. And as I said, allof this was achieved thanks to the tremendous hard work of the entire Tesla team.Model 3 is once again the best-selling premium vehicle in the U.S., outselling all of its gas-powered equivalents combined.","The company's Q2 2019 financial results and Q&A Webcast will be available on the company's website.

2019/7/24,"In Europe, Model 3 is approaching sales levels of its established premiumcompetitors, and it was awarded a 5-star rating from Euro NCAP earlier this month. This is inaddition to Model 3 receiving an overall 5-star rating in the U.S. from NHTSA and -- includingearning 5 stars in every category and subcategory and achieving the lowest probability of injury ofany vehicle ever tested.Motor Trend also recently selected Model S as the best vehicle they have ever tested in their 70-year history across all other cars. So Motor Trend, which is arguably the leading authority inevaluating vehicles, the Motor Trend Car of the Year is the most coveted award. It's prettyincredible that they would say that Model S in their entire 70-year history is the best vehicle theyhave ever evaluated. This is despite Tesla not buying any advertising in Motor Trend, and it speaksto their journalistic integrity. That's something special.So -- and since the vehicle that they evaluated, we've actually made -- committed to advancementsof both Model S and Model X, including our recent update of a new suspension with activedamping capability and an all-new drivetrain that's capable of a 370-mile range in the Model S anda 325-mile range in the Model X. We've also issued numerous software updates and improvementsthat have made Model S and Model X faster, safer and added dozens of new features. Just likeModel 3, Model S and X have the hardware needed for future full self-driving capability.As we look ahead to the rest of the year and into 2020, we remain focused on launching newvehicle and energy programs, further expanding on manufacturing operations and continuing toimprove customer service. We remain focused on international expansion because local productionis essential to being cost-competitive. By the end of this year, we will -- we expect to be producingModel 3s in volume out of Gigafactory Shanghai. And as you can see from the photos in ourquarterly letter, the equipment installation there is progressing well. We also have to finalize alocation for our European Gigafactory before the end of the year.Here in Fremont, preparations for Model Y production have already begun. Since Model Y has highcomponent overlap with Model 3, it should be -- we expect it to be a lot easier to ramp. It'ssomething in the order of 3/4 of all the parts are common between Model 3 and Model Y .","In Europe, Model 3 is approaching sales levels of its established premiumcompetitors, and it was awarded a 5-star rating from Euro NCAP earlier this month.

2019/7/24,"And weexpect many manufacturing costs for Model Y , despite additional content, to be approximately thesame as Model 3.This quarter, we opened 25 new service locations and added more than 100 Mobile Service vehiclesto our fleet. And although our fleets have a total -- Tesla fleet size has doubled in the past 12months, which is again just kind of a crazy thing to consider that Tesla is almost doubling allcumulative production every year. This is a totally mad thing to make as many cars in a year aswe've made in our entire history and to have that be an ongoing trend, I think it's difficult for peopleto really feel an exponential. We didn't evolve to feel an exponential. We can feel a linear, but wecan only understand an exponential at a cognitive level.But Tesla is expanding at an exponential rate. And in fact, if you look at the Tesla cumulativedeliveries chart like year-over-year cumulative deliveries, it's about the cleanest exponential graphI've ever seen. So obviously, if that trend continues, the results, I think, are going to be prettyamazing. And I think that will continue.So we've been able to improve service considerably. You can imagine that if -- obviously, if we'redoubling our fleet every year, managing service is quite difficult. It's like a total -- because servicescales as not just with new production but as the total fleet scales, service needs to scale. And wewant to scale service in a way that's sensible from a cost standpoint. But it's really quite a difficultchallenge to scale.Nonetheless, we've made massive improvements in service, especially in parts waiting -- time towait for parts and collision repair. And we've in-sourced a great deal of the collision repairactivities, which has had, I think, quite a good effect on customer happiness. And this will continuein the months to come.So it's a very important milestone. I think we believe Tesla has -- is now at the point of being self-funding, and we expect to be cash flow -- free cash flow Positive in future quarters with the possibletemporary exceptions around the launch and ramp of new product. From a profitability standpoint,we expect to be probably around breakeven this quarter and profitable next quarter. So that's -- I feelpretty confident about that.And then in terms of deliveries, we expect deliveries to be between 360,000 and 400,000.","This quarter, we opened 25 new service locations and added more than 100 Mobile Service vehiclesto our fleet.

2019/7/24,"Weexpect production to be a slightly higher number than that and demand to be a slightly highernumber than that. So people often confuse deliveries, production and orders for Tesla, and they'reactually 3 different numbers. So yes, you obviously cannot deliver more than you make, and sotypically, we will make more than we deliver. And then demand generation activities kind of movein kind of like -- to get together with production like it doesn't make sense to put a lot of effort intodemand generation if production can't meet the demand.And likewise -- so what tends to happen is that we'll solve the production issues, then say, okay, weneed to increase demand -- address demand then we may increase production, then increasedemand. And like I truly get caught up in these details a lot, but if you look at the actual results, likeI said, look at cumulative deliveries over time for Tesla, cleanest exponential we've ever seen,extrapolate that curve.So there's a tremendous amount to be excited about at Tesla, and we'll have more share in thecoming weeks and months. Zach, is there anything you'd like to say about our results?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, sure. And thanks, Elon. A few things I want to highlight before moving into the Q&A. Overall,Q2 was a strong quarter for Tesla. I'm extremely proud of the team for the progress we've made.We've achieved record vehicle production and delivery, record storage production and deployment,record services and other revenue with a corresponding reduced loss. As we've mentioned a fewtimes, we stabilized international logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes. And we sawgross margin improvement in nearly every aspect of the business, adjusting for the impact ofregulatory credit revenue.As a result of these accomplishments, we once again achieved strong free cash flows, which is onlypartially attributed to working capital benefits. We also successfully raised roughly $2.4 billion innet proceeds in May. Thus, we exited the quarter with $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, thehighest in our history. Our net loss reduced significantly relative to Q1, aided by higher volumes inprogress on cost efficiencies.A few things to note. There's $117 million within operating expenses for restructuring. We had asequential reduction of $104 million related to regulatory credit, which is inherently lumpy. And inour other income line, we saw a $66 million reduction.","People often confuse deliveries, production and orders for Tesla, and they'reactually 3 different numbers.

2019/7/24,"This is nearly entirely due to foreignexchange, which we don't hedge.GAAP automotive gross margin only reduced slightly despite the reduction in credit revenue andexpected reductions in our vehicle average selling prices. Adjusting for the impact of credits,automotive gross margin improved materially. For Model S and Model X, ASPs are impacted bypricing actions applied to inventory of vehicles built prior to the launch of our powertrain andsuspension upgrades in April, the majority of which were sold and delivered in Q2.For Model 3, global ASPs stabilized during the quarter at roughly $50,000, a sequential reduction,yet gross profit per Model 3 improved, representing the continued success of our cost managementefforts. Note that we continue to defer a significant portion of revenue associated with full self-driving, which will be recognized in future periods upon the release of additional features.Operating expenses, net of restructuring, continues to improve as well despite the increases involume, reflecting the immense focus on improving our operating efficiency. And while operatingexpenses and capital expenses may appear to be unnaturally low this quarter, that's not the case.Rather, these reflect continued progress on cost efficiency and ability to scale our core technologiesand processes.If we take a step back here, I think it's important to remember that Tesla is on a long-term journey,and it's difficult to see the full picture looking quarter-to-quarter. We committed that Model 3 willbe a transformative product, both for the industry and our business. 3 years ago, we unveiled theModel 3. 2 years ago, we brought the product to market. 1 year ago, we demonstrated our ability tobuild the Model 3 at high rate.So far this year, we've demonstrated our ability to manage global deliveries and logistics at a higherrate, but the most important thing is that we've demonstrated our ability to generate significantorganic demand as nearly all orders generated in Q2 were nonreservation holders. And thus far inQ3, our order pacing is ahead of where we were at this point in Q2. And as we noted in our Q2production and delivery release, our order backlog increased over the course of Q2.Ultimately, the Model 3 is accomplishing what our business needs it to do. It expanded our salesand customer base, enabling us to generate cash we need to reinvest.","GAAP automotive gross margin only reduced slightly despite the reduction in credit revenue andexpected reductions in our vehicle average selling prices.

2019/7/24,"In the process, we'veappropriately managed our operating expenses and have reduced the cost of running the business.This is critically important because I feel as though we've broken through a baseline fixed costbarrier enabled by the success of the Model 3 business.With continued focus on execution and cost management, the next 12 to 18 months should be themost exciting yet. During this time, we believe that Gigafactory Shanghai will be producing atscale. Model Y will be in production, addressing the most popular vehicle segment.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOGenerally on ASP, as we noted in the letter, it was roughly, even over the course of the quarter,stabilized around $50,000. And we have good visibility into where our ASPs are going based onorder data. And so that gives us 1 to 2 months of lead as to where our actual recognized ASPs willbe. And so I would expect some adjustment to our Model 3 ASPs as a result of this pricing change,but the trim mix will offset some of that. And we continue to make great progress on costefficiencies. And so overall in net, our expectation is that the Model 3 gross margin will continue togrow.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. On the gross margin point, like the full self-driving is just an extremely important part of themargin calculation, and the features for full self-driving are -- only a portion of them have rolledout. So the revenue recognition on the full self-driving option is limited at first until those featuresroll out. And also, the demand for the full self-driving package is limited because the features aremostly prospective instead of current. But as those features roll out, I would expect the take rate forfull self-driving to increase significantly as well as the recognition -- revenue recognition of fullself-driving to obviously match the rollout of the product. So the gross margin over time will bereally quite compelling when factoring in the full self-driving option, which is, yes, accounted to$7,000 in mid-August. And that number will increase over time.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThe second question is many of us who follow Tesla closely are incredibly excited about Batteryand Powertrain Investor Day and its technology implications.

Can you update us on what has been done to dateto ensure that all owners are receiving an industry-leading customer experience?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorSure. I meet with the service team multiple times a week and get daily updates on the reliability ofthe vehicle. We -- the best service, of course, is no service. Like that's the vehicle just -- reliabilityand quality being so good that service is rarely required. That's what the main goal is like, eliminatethe need for service. Then in terms of increasing service resources, we're opening service centers asfast as we can and have already opened 25 new service locations this quarter, and that will increase-- the rate of service center opening will increase dramatically in through the course of this year aswell as more Mobile Service. Mobile Service is really great because it's like we just come to youand fix the car wherever you are. And it's hard to beat that for convenience. For parts delivery,we've made massive improvement to logistics for getting parts to service centers. Hey, Jerome, doyou want to -- Jerome is helping to manage the service -- global service and...Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionYes. As you pointed out, the best service is no service. So we're trying to continue improving thequality of the cars. And we track this daily, and fewer and fewer service visits are required from themost recent cars that we're building. So we're on a good trend there. We also need a lot fewer workto finish the cars in the factory. Besides that, we stock way many more parts in all the servicecenters, and we ship everything same day pretty much so that people don't have to wait for cars --for parts. And we accelerate service, and we increase capacity.","Elon R.

And part of the reason I ask is, at least by my analysis, itlooks like maybe 70% of the Model 3s sold in the quarter were in the U.S., which is sort of higherthan your normalized percentage of U.S. sales. And so do you feel that, that phenomenon may haveoccurred in Q2? And are you still confident that Q3 deliveries can improve sequentially?

And thenyou throw like a truck in there, pickup truck and till the semi, it just gets smaller and smaller. Sothey are great products, but they are -- from a volume standpoint, they're not all that important inthe long term.","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think it's probably a bit too much focus on S and X. Sothey are great products, but they are -- from a volume standpoint, they're not all that important inthe long term. But the story for Tesla future is fundamentally Model 3 and Model Y . And I think -- so like myguess is like long-term sales of 0.75 million units a year.

2019/7/24,"And so what we're basically putting all parts that are used more frequently than like 6 weeksliterally on the walls of the service centers. There's no ordering of the part. You just go take it offshelf and put it on the car. We really want to get to not merely same-day service but same hour. Sortof like Jiffy Lube but applied generally to service.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. And specifically on the working capital piece of this, we actually have a significant amount ofservice parts inventory. The challenge is it's not just at the service centers. And so a lot of the lagthat is experienced is we have to get the part from the distribution center to the service center. Andso by moving -- by localizing the parts, I don't expect that to be a large working capital drain on thecompany. It might actually be the reverse where we don't need to store as many potentially.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And also just having parts, if I may add, if we made them internally or if they're made at asupplier, just sending them directly to the service center instead of like having them go through abunch of distribution outlets. In fact, like when I was in China on my last trip, I was like asking theChina team, ""Hey, is there anything silly that we're doing that we should fix?"" And they said, ""Yes,well, several of the parts that require replacement are literally made in China, and then we end upshipping them to New Jersey and then back to China. And could we please just ship them likeliterally across the road?"" And I'm like, yes, no problem.

I would now like to hand the conference to over your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Directorof Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherrine. And good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2019 Q&AWebcast.I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q3 resultswere announced at about 2 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link asthis webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. First of all, I'd like to just thank the Tesla team for an incredible job this quarter. Theexecution was outstanding and on just about every front. So it's just an honor to work with such agreat team.Q4 -- Q3 was obviously a very strong quarter. And we had record deliveries. We're able to makegreat strides in controlling our costs. We shifted back to GAAP profitability while also generatingstrong free cash flow. And again, this would not be possible without each employee doing their partto reduce cost. Our operating cost is now at the lowest level since Model 3 production started.Regarding Gigafactory Shanghai, this month, we started trial production at Giga Shanghai in bothvehicles from body to paint to general assembly. So this is a -- I want to emphasize, this is a realfactory with a tremendous amount of equipment in it. While a lot of people see the outside shell ofthe factory, which is enormous and it was essentially underwater in January, it was just below thewater table literally, what is, I think, much more significant is that we're able to install massivestamping machines, a fully operational paint shop and a sophisticated general assembly line in thesame period of time in parallel with building the building. I'd like to thank our entire team for this extraordinary achievement.","Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives will discuss Tesla's Q3 2019 Financial Results and Q&A Webcast.

2019/10/23,"I'm not aware of any factory ofthis magnitude in history being constructed in such a short period of time, approximately 10months. As far as I know, this is unprecedented. And Gigafactory Shanghai will become a templatefor future growth. We're planning to build Model Ys in Shanghai as well, of course, and build aGigafactory in Europe. And we hope to announce the location of that Gigafactory -- in fact, we willannounce the location of that Gigafactory before the end of this year.Regarding Model Y , we're also ahead of schedule on Model Y preparations in Fremont. And we'vemoved the launch time line from fall 2020 to summer 2020. There may be some room forimprovement there, but we're confident about summer 2020.I've actually recently driven the Model Y Release Candidate, and I think it's going to an amazingproduct and be very well received. I think it's quite likely to -- it's just my opinion, but I think it willoutsell S, X and 3 combined.Regarding Version 10 and Smart Summon, last month, we released our latest software, Version 10,which includes video streaming, games, karaoke, Spotify and a host of other new features andimprovements. Most importantly, it includes the first version of Smart Summon, which has nowbeen used 1 million times. So it's now over 1 million users of Smart Summon. And we're -- in thenext week or so, we will be releasing an improved version of Smart Summon, taking into accountall the data from those 1 million Smart Summon attempts.So this really illustrates the value of having a massive fleet because it allows us to collect thesecorner cases and learn from them and use fleet learning and become rapidly better, just as Navigateon Autopilot did on the freeway. So expect a number of improvements in Smart Summon in theweeks to come. And this really is just the beginning as we collect more data and Autopilot and FullSelf-Driving functionality gets better.I do -- while it's going to be tight, it still does appear that we will be at least in limited -- in earlyaccess release of a feature-complete Full Self-Driving future this year. So it's not for sure, but itappears to be on track for at least the early access release of a fully functional Full Self-Driving bythe end of this year.And yes, lastly, we're highly focused on decisions that really make a material difference to thecompany such as opening Gigafactories in other continents.","We're also ahead of schedule on Model Y preparations in Fremont.

2019/10/23,"Yes, it's worth noting that these --ultimately, having 3 Gigafactories, effectively, we'll actually triple our output. And then when youconsider increased output per Gigafactory, it's going to actually more than triple our output overtime.And then there are a lot of interesting things happening with respect to advanced batteries and moreefficient powertrains and Full Self-Driving, all that sort of stuff. But that will be something for afuture time.And then one last item is that tomorrow afternoon, we will be releasing version 3 of the Tesla SolarRoof. That's the integrated solar -- with solar panels integrated with the roof. So that's -- I think thisis a great product. Version 1 and 2, we're still sort of figuring things out. Version 3, I think, is finallyready for the big time. And so we're scaling up production of the version 3 solar tower roof at ourBuffalo Gigafactory. And I think this product is going to be incredible. But we'll talk more aboutthat on the official product launch, which will be tomorrow afternoon.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And I think Zachary has some remarks as well.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thank you, Elon. Thank you, Martin. Q3 was a great quarter for Tesla. I know manyemployees are listening right now, and I want to thank you for your passion and your hard work.We've made terrific progress, and yet again, we realized margin improvement in nearly every aspectof the business.There are 3 key points I'd like to highlight. First, we returned to profitability in Q3, aided byimproved gross profit, reduced operating expenses in the absence of Negative onetime items thatweighed on our financials in the first half of the year. GAAP automotive gross margin improvedsequentially to 22.8% and over 20% excluding regulatory credits.We achieved these improvements through higher production volumes on S/X and Model 3, enablingbetter fixed cost absorption. We realized improvements in labor hours per vehicle as well as othercosts such as warehousing, logistics, delivery and import-related items. We're also makingcontinued progress reducing material costs, including commercial negotiations with suppliers.Model S and X ASPs increased even accounting for revenue deferrals related to free unlimitedsupercharging. And Model 3 ASPs declined slightly driven by mix in Asia, pricing action inEMEA.","Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thank you, Martin. Q3 was a great quarter for Tesla.

2019/10/23,"Our pace ofexecution on these factories and capacity expansion has increased significantly. As Elon mentioned,the first phase of Gigafactory Shanghai is already production-ready, and we've been able to pull inthe time line for other major projects.Overall, we are quickly turning the corner for our next phase of growth, and our financial healthcontinues to strengthen. We remain focused on reducing cost, which enables rapid investments infuture programs and growth.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, and I think also, our Senior Director of Energy Operations, Kunal Girotra,wanted to add some remarks.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsHi, everyone. My name is Kunal Girotra, and I've been with Tesla for about 4 years, working ondifferent aspects of deploying our energy products. I now run Tesla Energy's deployment andfulfillment teams.Over the last 3 months, the energy teams have made great progress in both our solar and energystorage businesses. As you can see in our quarterly deck, our solar deployments rose by almost 50%over the last quarter. And our energy storage deployment, which includes Powerwalls andPowerpacks, grew by 15% to an all-time high of 477 megawatt hours.In the last 3 months, we relaunched Tesla solar in North America by simplifying our solar offeringinto 3 sizes of small, medium and large. We're transferring pricing on the website.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorActually, if I may interject a minute, but what a lot of people don't realize is in -- like in Californiaand in a number of other states, if you buy our sort of solar subscription or solar rental, there's nomoney down and you instantly save on your utility bill and there's no long-term contract. So it'skind of a no-brainer. It's really do you want something that prints money? And if it doesn't printmoney, we'll fix it or take it back. It's kind of a no-brainer. And it sort of plays into Tesla'soverarching strategy here, which is effectively to become like a giant distributed global utility onthe energy front.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsYes, absolutely. The subscription solar offering that you mentioned was launched in 6 states. Andlike you said, it's fixed monthly payments and no long-term contracts. And the response fromcustomers have been pretty awesome.Elon R.

2019/10/23,"It's something that we're very excited about within thecompany.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Thank you. And the last question from institutional investors is, can you provide an updateon FSD package attach rates? As FSD attach rates improve, will you let the financial benefitsmanifest in higher gross margins for company and shareholders? Or will you lower the price todrive delivery volume?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI don't think we're going to need to lower the price of FSD. But I expect the price of FSD toincrease slowly as the functionality and capability improve. That's -- that is unchanged. Anythingyou want to add? I mean, our cash gross margin obviously is higher than our GAAP gross marginbecause of unrecognized revenue associated with FSD attach rates. So that's why I think it's in theorder of $600 million or in the order of $0.5 billion...Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFO$500 million.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & Director$0.5 billion of unrecognized revenue. So if you were to include that, which would obviously berecognized as we release the Full Self-Driving functionality, but actual gross margin that we'reoperating on, on a cash basis today is higher than the GAAP gross margin.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Let's now go to questions from retail investors. The first question from Craig is, can youprovide more detail on the DeepScale acquisition, its importance and whether Tesla is still on trackto recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs with automatic driving on city streets by theend of 2019?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorSure. DeepScale is a very tiny company. It's basically about 12 people. And it's -- they have someexpertise in increasing the efficiency of neural net for a given amount of compute, which I think ishelpful. So it remains to be seen. But the intent behind what was a very tiny acquisition, was to, Ithink, slightly accelerate FSD. That's the intent. And hopefully, that will turn out to be true. Yes.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The second question, we've already answered regarding Model Y delivery. So we'll jump tothe third question from Craig. News reports suggest that Gigafactory 3 already -- may already beproducing Model 3s for Chinese markets.","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & Director$0.5 billion of unrecognized revenue.

2019/10/23,"Could you please update us on the productionexpectations for Giga 3 and confirm purpose of the second building now being built? Is that forbattery production as suggested by some press outlets?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. We're in trial production of Model 3. We're basically sending cars through the system, andwe're ramping rapidly. We're expecting to hit volume production in a few months essentially.The second building is, indeed, for battery and module production. And that's probably going to --because there's obviously a bunch more construction beyond what's already there becauseobviously, we need to build out facilities for Model Y production at Shanghai as well.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The next question from retail investors is, can you update us on the initial results of Tesla carinsurance? Is there a time line to expand it nationally and internationally?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, I can take that. So far, we've launched Tesla Insurance in California. I have to say that I'm quitepleased by the results so far. The take rate, as measured by quote-to-purchase conversioning arequite high by industry standards. And we expect that this will only increase as folks understand theproducts better and receive some of the known price increases coming from some of the standardcarriers that they'll come to us and look for an alternative.There's a bunch of work happening behind the scenes on improving the product, particularly thepurchase flow, to make sure it's the best product experience for our customers. And we're alsoworking very hard to get other states lined up in the States and then also to launch in some countriesinternationally. So we're not able to provide specific time lines on those changes, but we'redefinitely working as quickly as we can given how well received Tesla Insurance has been inCalifornia.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think it also has a secondary effect of ensuring that the third-party providers of insuranceprovide reasonable rates to our customers.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOI completely agree. The goal here is not to have an outsized market share of insurance. It's just tomake sure that customers have an alternative to other companies as well if those rates are high. Imean ultimately, what makes the most sense for total cost of ownership perspective is for folks tohave good pricing on their insurance.Elon R.","Elon R.

2019/10/23,"Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. And the last question from retail investors. There's skepticism regarding your comment thatthe Full Self-Driving will be feature-complete by year-end, like resulting from confusion aboutfeature-complete, what feature-complete means. Could you please talk to this and perhaps give us alist of features that establish the FSD baseline?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorFeature-complete, I mean, it's able -- the car's able to drive from one's house to work, most likelywithout interventions. So it will still be supervised, but it will be able to drive -- it will fill in the gapfrom low-speed autonomy -- we've got low-speed autonomy with Summon. We've got high-speedautonomy on the highway. And we've got intermediate speed autonomy, which really just meanstraffic lights and stop signs.So feature-complete means it's most likely able to do that without intervention, without humanintervention, but it would still be supervised.And I've gone through this time line before, I think, several times. But it is often misconstrued. Butthere's like -- there's 3 major levels to autonomy. There's the car being able to be autonomous butrequiring supervision and intervention at times; that's feature-complete. Then there's -- and itdoesn't mean like every scenario, everywhere on earth including every corner case. It means mostof the time.And then there's another level which is that we think it's -- that from a Tesla standpoint, we thinkthe car is safe enough to be driven without supervision.Then the third level would be that regulators are also convinced that the car can be drivenautonomously without supervision.

2019/10/23,"Our first question comes from Dan Galves with Wolfe Research.Daniel V . Galves - Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research & Senior AnalystI was hoping that you could give us a little bit more color on sizing up the key factors in the autogross margin improvement from Q3 to Q2. Particularly, you mentioned some nonrecurring items inthe letter. And also, should investors be prepared for any meaningful headwinds as the China plantcomes up but isn't at full production yet?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. I can provide a couple of comments on that. So on your final -- on your last question aboutChina headwinds, there are always ramp inefficiencies when we launch a new factory. So we don'texpect China to be any different than that. So there will be some that we experience in Q4. Theamount of that is hard to forecast given that it's a different type of factory design than we did here inFremont. We're working very hard to limit the ramp inefficiencies, but certainly, fixed costabsorption and having all of the labor ready as we ramp will have an impact on Q4.And on the margin improvement, a couple of things there for auto gross margin. As I mentioned inmy opening remarks, S and X average selling prices increased from Q2 to Q3. I mean that'simportant. As I mentioned in the last earnings call, the prior powertrain versions of S and Xprovided significant headwinds on average selling price for that product in the quarter.We've also done a bunch of work as a company to become more targeted in how we adjust pricingon our products and how we optimize that based on local supply and demand. And so I think there'sa bunch of good work from the team on that in Q3, which flowed through on our financials.And cost reduction has just remained a huge focus for us. It's hard to underestimate how much ofthat has been ingrained in the culture of the company. And Jerome and his team have doneabsolutely tremendous work there. So on every line item of our cost, whether it be manufacturing,labor, warehousing, logistics, there's just a tremendous amount of good work that happened there.Specifically on nonrecurring items, to that, I'll note one being the Smart Summon revenuerecognition. Debatable whether that's considered recurring or not given that we continue to expectto release more features and release revenue associated with that in the future.","Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes.

2019/10/23,"Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.George M. Dailey - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research AssociateThis is George Dailey on for Adam. So first question. Is it a fair assumption to say that once theShanghai Gigafactory has ramped, the Model 3s sold in China for China could be the mostprofitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont right now?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOThat one is also difficult to forecast. It's a good question. At least based on the plans that we havenow, we're expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model 3 is coming out of our Fremontfactory. There's still a bunch of work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch withramp inefficiencies, and we need to work those costs down. And then there will be work to land onwhat the right mix is within the country and where we ultimately land on the product offering. So Ithink just for now, it's safe to assume that it's roughly in line with the margins that you see comingout of the Fremont facility.George M. Dailey - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research AssociateGreat. And if I could just sneak in one more. So it's been over 7 years since you launched the ModelS, and many OEMs seem that they don't have the same commitment to battery electric vehicles thatyou do, and many don't even offer one right now.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think there's -- it will be consistent with the mission of Tesla to help other car companies withelectric vehicles on the battery and powertrain fronts, also in other fronts. So it's something we'reopen to. As I think a lot of people know, we open-source our patents so that those would not serveas an obstacle to the adoption of electric vehicles or solar power or stationary storage.

We want it to be fun andentertaining in reference to something that you love.And so just I think there's a lot one can do because people are generally spending a couple of hoursa day on average in the car. And so that's pretty high percentage of the waking time, outside of likeshowering and going to the bathroom and that kind of thing. It's just a lot of time. And I guessmaybe there's some way to monetize it but we haven't really thought about it that way.But our goal is just to make -- try to say what is the most fun you could possibly have while you'rein your car.

Please go ahead, sir.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2019Q&A Webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of otherexecutives.Our Q4 results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published atthe same link as this webcast.During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. So Q4 was another strong quarter for the company. Deliveries reached over112,000 vehicles in a single quarter. It's hard to think of a similar product with such strong demandthat it can generate more than $20 billion in revenue with 0 advertising spend. I think that's -- wherewe do say that from time to time, I think it's often overlooked, but to have the highest-demandelectric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is, I think, quite remarkable and speaks tothe nature of the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate thatdemand without a bunch of advertising.At our Fremont factory, we're producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in itsrecord year of 2006. And obviously, we expect to exceed that significantly this year. This rate ofproduction was [cheap] before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont. So there's alot of potential to go beyond that number.For the Shanghai factory, I'd like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launchingModel 3 last quarter and achieving the first deliveries earlier this year. I'm really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory. I think it's going to be an incredible asset tothe company. And we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in Shanghai. So a lot of goodprogress there.Regarding Model Y , it was only 10 months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype.","During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.

2020/1/29,"And now inJanuary this year, we started producing Model Y in limited volumes already. Now this is thanks to agreat effort from our engineering team. And we managed to achieve, by far, the highest energyefficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Yall-wheel drive got an EPA rating of 315 miles. This improvement is reflected on the configurator asof today. This is above what we've previously stated by a pretty significant margin. And then justwith great acceleration, top speed, it's really just incredible specs all around.For the Cybertruck, a few months ago, we revealed the -- obviously, remember, we revealed theCybertruck, that was -- that went viral. And we tried to build a product that -- a product that issuperior in every way without any preconceptions of how such a product should look. So it reallyjust -- from the standpoint of what's the most badass, futuristic, armored personnel carrier that kicksthe ass of any other pickup truck, basically that's the goal. And we wanted it to look like somethingthat just kind of came out of a sci-fi movie set from the future. And the demand has been incredible.We've never seen actually such a level of demand at this -- we've never seen anything like it,basically. I think we will make as -- about as many as we can sell for many years. So as many -- wewill sell as many as we can make. It's going to be pretty nuts. So -- and I think, actually, the productis better than people realize even. They don't even have enough information to realize just theawesomeness of it. It's just great.So -- and then stepping back in 2018, from a financial standpoint, we were -- free cash flow ratewas breakeven. But in 2019, we managed to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow whilebuilding a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y in production. SoI think for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacitywhile developing new products, while improving the core engineering, is a testament to the, I think,incredible performance of the Tesla team.

2020/1/29,"That's what hasallowed us to get to these compelling financial numbers, while at the same time, growing companyat an incredible pace.And in conclusion, when I think of what we have in front of us in the next couple of years, we'vegot Model Y , we've got Giga Berlin, Tesla Semi, Solarglass Roof, Cybertruck, some very excitingimprovements in battery technology, we've got Full Self-Driving, the next-gen Roadster andprobably a bunch of other products we'll come up with, too.

Thanks, Martin. This past year was truly transformational for Tesla, and I want to thankeveryone who's been a part of making this happen.On 2019, a few key points I'd like to highlight. On demand, while we've mentioned this a fewtimes, it's worth highlighting once again. Over the course of the year, we've transitioned entirelyfrom generating Model 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.We've also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs, even increasing slightly in Q4. And we've seen anincrease in ASPs of S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.With respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch ofModel 3 in Fremont and Reno. As a result, we've been able to bring new production capacity onboard faster and with less cost. This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in Shanghai as well asModel Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched in under one year.Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled throughhigher volumes, improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management andcontinued improvement in our product and operational costs. And we are able to achieve PositiveGAAP net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled strong cashgeneration.","This past year was truly transformational for Tesla, and I want to thankeveryone who's been a part of making this happen.

2020/1/29,"Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. We are going to take the first questions from retail investors compiled by SayTechnologies.So the first retail investor question is, ""since solar is required for all new home constructions inCalifornia, do you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large Californiahomebuilders that you can share? What's the 2020 target for the number of Solarglass Roofinstallations in California?""Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I think we do -- we are seeing, mostly from a small base, exponential growth in demand andoutput for solar -- for the Solarglass Roof. So it's difficult to predict what the demand will be thisyear, except that the demand is very strong. And we are working also not just through Tesla SolarRoof but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whetherit's in North America, on the order of 4 million new roofs per year. So we see a lot of interest.And so it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do theinstallation. But over time, I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something touse Solarglass in one form or another. It's really going to be a choice of do you want a roof that isalive with power or dead without. And I think people will want a live roof that generates power andlooks good and lasts a long time, and it's the future we want.So it will be a significant product, but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product andthere's a lot of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome, and this will be a major productline of Tesla. And the Buffalo factory is doing great. So, yes.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. And the second question from retail shareholders is, ""will you release the Tesla ride-hailing network app before full autonomy and change the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow ownersto be drivers on the network?

2020/1/29,"- Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I think it's -- it probably will make sense to have the -- to enable car sharing in advance of thekind of sort of driving robotaxi fleet because the car sharing can be done before Full Self-Driving isapproved by regulators. So it's probably something that we would enable before the full sort ofrobotaxi fleet is enabled. And it sounds like there were some other questions bundled in there.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRSuperchargers at airports.Elon R.

That's not currently the case, but by thetime that this is available, it's our intent to get that ready.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRYes, thank you. Next question from retail investors is, ""how many California owners are currentlyinsured with Tesla Insurance? What's the target for Tesla Insurance in 2020? When will you start tosignificantly leverage the data you have from the fleet to lower the cost of your coverage? Will weget premium discount of certain percent?""Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, go ahead, Zach.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. So Tesla Insurance is currently available in California. A couple of things that we're workingon, on this front. The first is to expand it to other locations. And we're preparing the regulatoryprocesses -- preparing our processes to go through the regulatory processes in those locations. We'realso working on the processes to continue to adjust our rates in California, which also have to gothrough regulatory processes as insurance is quite heavily regulated. And that's where we'respending our time focusing on Tesla Insurance right now. There's a significant amount ofinnovation, as we've discussed before in this space, exactly getting to the intent of what the questionhere is, using our technology to reduce rates.

""Since most retail investorsseem to understand Tesla better than analysts and are risking a larger part of their own personalwealth on Tesla, doesn't it make sense to take mostly questions on these earnings calls from us, viaSay? Do you even have to take questions -- answer questions from analysts?""Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I guess we don't have to. I do think that a lot of retail investors actually have a deeper andmore accurate insights than many of the big institutional investors and certainly a better insight thanmany of the analysts. It seems like if people really looked at some of the smart retail investors,analysts and -- what some of the smart -- smaller retail investors predicted about the future of Tesla,that would -- you'd probably get the highest accuracy and remarkable insight from some of thosepredictions.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. So now let's switch to institutional shareholder questions. The #1 question is, you havespoken previously about Shanghai Giga being 65% lower CapEx per unit of capacity. Have youlearned to do anything better or different from an OpEx perspective? And if yes, what kind ofimpact might we expect on the long-term gross margin?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorSure. Go ahead, Zach.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. The Shanghai factory has been a quite remarkable cost experience across all line items ofCOGS for the Model 3 there.","The core Autopilot software andAI team is just, I think, very, very strong and making great progress. And we're really onlybeginning to take full advantage of the Autop Pilot hardware, the FSD hardware. So I think it's -- theapparent progress, as seen by consumers, will seem to be extremely rapid. But actually, what'sreally going on, it seems like that is just having the foundational software be very strong, havereally strong foundation. And then a really fundamental thing is moving to video training. This is a really -- I mean, in terms of labelingefficiency, arguably like a 3 order of magnitude improvement in labeling efficiency. So that's really great progress on that. And the last retail investor question comes from Kendall.

There is no artificial holdback on expenditures.Anything that I see that is -- looks like it's got good value for money, the answer is yes,immediately. So we're spending money, I think, efficiently and we're not artificially limiting ourprogress. And then despite all that, we are still generating Positive cash. So in light of that, it doesn'tmake sense to raise money because we expect to generate cash despite this growth level.Zach, I don't know if you want to...Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFONo. I completely agree with that. I think some of our learnings during the Model 3 launch periodwere we grew too quickly and with too much complexity, and it held back our ability to continue toscale. And part of the journey that we've been on in 2019 is to unwind a series of unintentional badprocesses that kind of accumulated in the company over time. And so that's kind of whatcontributes to the reduction in OpEx over the year as we get smarter about that.And now we've laid a good foundation, I think. And I agree with you on that, we're not holdingback on the growth. I mean we have 2 products -- 2 vehicle products launching right now.

We did see an increase in operatingexpenses from Q3 to Q4, even excluding the portion of that attributed to stock-based compensation.And when you double click into that growth, it's supporting the Model Y program and alsoShanghai program as well.And so I think we, as a company, are now at the point where we've learned a lot on cost efficiency,as I've just mentioned. And we've unwound a number of the processes that were not in the rightplace, including automating with things that need to be automated. And we'll continue on thatjourney. But I think we're at a point now where OpEx will start to tick up, at least if you lookannually from 2019 to 2020, to support our international footprint and then the growth of thecompany.

So Elon, do you see potentialfor Tesla vehicles to be fitted with user terminals that are compatible with the Starlink constellationin the near- or medium-term future?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it's certainly something that could be happening in the coming years. There's no plans for itthis year. The focus of Starlink is really for high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity for homesand businesses, and I guess, aircraft and boats and that kind of thing. But the antenna for that high-bandwidth, low-latency thing is sort of about the size of medium pizza, which you could put on acar, but I think it's more bandwidth than you would really need.

How would -- assuming that we get the antennaform factor and cost down to a point where that could be integrated to the roof of a car, for example,cost effectively and aerodynamically, et cetera, how would compatibility with the Starlinkarchitecture theoretically improve the Tesla customer experience or the capability of the network?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I think it actually most possible that we'll just use the cellular connectivity, just use 5G. Itwould be the recommendation, certainly, in like any cities or something like that. But if you're outin the countryside and there's not good cell connectivity, then maybe you could connect with aStarlink antenna. And you don't need to like have like gigabit level or level of connectivity. You can-- probably like 20, 30 megabits is probably fine.

First question related to Cybertruck. You mentioned you'll sell asmany as you can make. Can you remind me how many you think you can make? And any thoughtson the cost of production for making those Cybertrucks?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we don't comment on those detailed numbers, except the demand is just far more than wecould reasonably make in the space of, I don't know, 3 or 4 years or something like that. So thething we're going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that'svery fundamental because if you don't improve battery production capacity, then you end up justshifting unit volume from one product to another, and you haven't actually produced more electricvehicles.So that's part of the reason why we have not, for example, really accelerated production of the TeslaSemi because it does use a lot of cells. And unless we've got a lot of battery cells available, then saylike accelerated production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making fewer Model 3or Model Y cars. So we've got to really make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery productionand continue to improve the cost per kilowatt hour of the batteries. This is very fundamental andextremely difficult.So I said we're going to do like kind of Battery Day just to kind of explain more about this and whatour plans are.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWe're not quite sure what's going to happen, but it is true that Model X -- the introduction of ModelX actually increased Model S sales because people would come in and look at the Model X andthey like said, ""okay, I prefer the sedan.""

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureElon, I wanted to come back on batteries. And if I look at the end of this year, you should have800,000 units in production capacity forecast. So that's -- if you add to that Model S and Model Xand then the energy storage business, it means you've been following north of 60 gigawatt hour ofbattery production capacity. So where do you stand now? And how do you get there? And then itlooks like your competitors, others who would like to compete with you, seem to be struggling togrow battery capacity.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I guess a lot of people sort of made fun of us for not like being able to build cars and buildcapacity. And it's like now it turns out, actually, even the pros have trouble with it. It's pretty hard.But the fact is, we've already demonstrated massive growth in cell production capacity at ourGigafactory in Nevada. And you have to go from the cells to the modules to the pack. So it's notjust cell capacity but also module and pack capacity. So we've just gotten pretty good at that.And we've worked well with key partners, like Panasonic. The Panasonic relationship has beenexcellent. They've been a great partner with us for many years. We've added some additionalpartners at a smaller scale with LG and CATL.And yes, we'll have more to talk about this in detail on Battery Day.

2020/4/29,"Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and wecome to Tesla's Q1 2020 Financial Resultsand Q&A Webcast. Please be advised that today's conference is beingrecorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Directorfor Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2020 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ1 results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.This is the first time we have achieved Positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatorycredits, while ramping 2 major products. What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviouslylearned a lot here. After all -- after the Model 3 ramp from 3 years ago, our new products get runfaster and become profitable sooner. In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter thanModel 3s in Fremont in the first 2 quarters. Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster thanthe Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1. Most surprisingly is, otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule thatwe were ahead of already. Most surprisingly -- Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter ofproduction, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to earlyaccess users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week. Ourcars will now automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic lights until the driver gets aconfirmation to proceed.","The conference call is being recorded.

2020/4/29,"I should say that the car is actually capable of much more than this, but weare only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel that it is probably asafety improvement. We are collecting data from over 1 million intersections every month at thispoint. This number will grow exponentially as more people get the update and as more people startdriving again. Soon, we will be collecting data from over 1 billion intersections per month. All of those confirmations are training on neural net. Essentially, the driver when driving and takingaction is effectively labeling the -- labeling reality as they drive, and it makes them really get betterand better. I think this is an advantage that no one else has, and we're quite literally orders ofmagnitude more than everyone else combined. I think this is difficult to fully appreciate. It's thereason I'd say it's very difficult to have a search engine that competes with Google becauseeveryone is training Google all the time with their searches. So when you search something, andyou click on a link, you're training Google every time you do that. It's just very difficult for any newsearch engine to compete on that basis.So all those confirmations are training on neural net, and soon cars will be able to drive through anintersection without a confirmation as well as to make turns. And we really feel we're -- I feelextremely confident that it will be possible to do a drive from your home to your office most of thetime with no interventions by the end of the year. So this is -- we can almost do this already with theleading-edge alpha builds driving in the car.So let's see, on other technology fronts, we increased the range of Model S and X yet again, thistime to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X. Actually, we said that, actually, themodel -- the real Model S range is 400 miles. But when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately, EPAhad left the car door opened and the keys in the car. So the car -- and they did this overnight. And sothe car actually went into waiting-for-driver mode and lost 2% of its range and, as a result, had a391 test.","The car is actually capable of much more than this, but weare only exposing functionality that we feel quite good about and where we feel that it is probably asafety improvement.

2020/4/29,"As soon as the EPA reopens for testing, we will redo the test, and we're actually confidentthat we will achieve a 400-mile or greater range with the Model S. But to be clear, the Model S forthe past 2 months -- the true range of the Model S for the past 2 months has been 400 miles. And ofcourse, we're not stopping there. We're looking -- we're going to continue pushing for improvedrange over time and improving handling, acceleration and all the little details that make Teslaspecial.For Model Y , we introduced a revolutionary 2-piece rear underbody casting, but we are going to bemaking a single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body iscast as a single piece, which is no casting of this size and complexity has ever been done before. Infact, there isn't even anything that is on par with the 2-piece casting for the Model Y . So we're reallypushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing. I'm very excited aboutthis approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH. It's better in everyway, essentially.We also -- for Model Y , we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car tohave a higher range. So the Model Y has remarkable range, on par with -- in fact, slightly betterthan, I guess, the Model 3, and despite being a bigger car that weighs more. And the heat pump is akey contributor to that. It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving. So -- and the feedbackwe're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally Positive.We're confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.So in conclusion, and just looking -- I guess this is a forward-looking statement, we are absolutelycontinuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai,and here in Fremont when they will let us continue. Localized production in China and in Europewill bring the costs down, making our products even more competitive over time. While many othercompanies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite. We are absolutely pedal tothe metal on new products and expanding the company.","For Model Y , we introduced a revolutionary 2-piece rear underbody casting, but we are going to bemaking a single-piece casting later this year.

2020/4/29,"And we're really looking forward to being,sometime next year, a truly global manufacturer with major factories in North America, China andEurope and a capacity of well over 1 million units a year.

And now to Zach's opening remarks.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thanks, Martin, and thanks, Elon. I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla teamthis past quarter. A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned. We successfullylaunched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y , as Elon mentioned, significantlyahead of schedule. This is our second large-scale product launch since Model 3 in 2017, and it'sevidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp efficiency. It's hard to understate thesignificance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of production.Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents ofModel 3s built in Fremont. This is despite not yet running at full capacity while also managingthrough the production shutdown in early February. We also announced a long-range andperformance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will Positively impact ASPs in China.On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of governmentincentives at the end of Q4. In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit. Automotive grossmargin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products despite chargestaken in Q1 associated with production downtime. We continue to make progress on OpExefficiency as well as our service and other margins. Our energy business was impacted as well byshutdown activities in Q1, limiting deployments. We also experienced expected launchinefficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted overallprofitability.As I've noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which are credits we sell to other carmakers,to generally increase with time. This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.","Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla teamthis past quarter.

2020/4/29,"And notethat most of the credit revenue did not contribute to cash in Q1, and it's reflected in the accountsreceivable on the balance sheet.Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary increase in end-of-quarter inventory for all ourproducts resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations. Had theseinterruptions not occurred, we were pacing towards a record quarter of deliveries and strong freecash flows.As Elon mentioned, it is extremely important that we remain on track to achieve our long-termplans and technology road map. We are taking the near-term actions required to continue thoseinvestments. Model Y in Shanghai and Berlin are proceeding as planned, and we're makingprogress on improving capacity for Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai. In the near term,our Shanghai factory remains operational, contributing an increasing level of cash flows andprofitability to the company. In Fremont, we're working towards restarting production as soon asthat's possible.We are also continuing to deliver cars that we were unable to deliver at the end of the first quarter.Our vehicle inventory balance increased by 14,000 units at the end of Q1, which was a headwind tofree cash flows in Q1, but it's helpful in Q2. Note that one of the most important aspects of Model Yin Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai is the dramatically improved cash conversion cycle by locallyproducing and delivering vehicles.While sales and delivery operations have paused in many areas of the world, we are still receivingmany online orders despite inability for our customers to experience the product prior to ordering.However, unavoidably, the extended shutdown in Fremont will have an impact on our near-termfinancial performance, and we will need to work through how quickly we'll be able to rampproduction to prior levels. More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows aremanaged appropriately. Working capital management, in particular raw material inventory, is thesingle most important lever in managing our cash flows during this time. The Tesla team has done agreat job here. We've also taken actions to eliminate or reduce noncritical expenses and optionalinvestments while continuing to drive efficiencies throughout the business.Overall, we've modeled many scenarios into 2021 and remain comfortable that we have sufficientliquidity to proceed fully with our most important long-term investments. It's important to note thatTesla remains an extremely agile and dynamic company, and this is aided by the substantial workwe've done over the last year to improve our cost efficiency and productivity.","Our free cash flows were impacted by the temporary increase in end-of-quarter inventory for all ourproducts resulting from the abrupt suspension of production and delivery operations.

2020/4/29,"Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. So we'll take the first questions from institutional investors compiled by SayTechnologies. The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet topurchase or experience FSD despite most vehicles having all the necessary hardware. What leverscould you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage? For example, could youconsider offering FSD as a premium subscription?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards theend of this year. I should say it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as, in our view, buyingFSD is an investment in the future. And we are confident that it is an investment that will pay off tothe consumer and to the benefit of the consumer. In my opinion, buying FSD option is somethingpeople will not regret doing.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOI agree. And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in thevehicle or a lease is -- will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preservethe option value of increased value of time. But we do understand that some customers who haveownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront. And so this will enablethose customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely. As you may be like, at a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area underthe curve of customer happiness. That is our goal. And we think that that's the kind of thing that allcompanies should try to do. And it's what results in long-term value creation. And loyalty begetsloyalty. So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we're confident thatif we behave like that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you.

2020/4/29,"To what extentis there room for Tesla to lower manufacturing costs in China and pass those savings to buyer sothey can qualify for the subsidy?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So we are making rapid progress on lowering the production cost in China. And we're actuallyexcited to announce on this call that we will be reducing the price of the standard range Model 3basically tomorrow, China time. So the day after tomorrow, California time, but tomorrow, Chinatime. And that will be a price below the subsidy limit. And we feel confident that, that will still be avehicle that delivers a good gross margin.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced inShanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's stillsignificant opportunity left to take cost out. So our fixed cost absorption from higher productionvolumes, which are occurring in Q2, will occur through the rest of the year. We're not fullylocalized on the supply chain yet. And so while a lot of the supply chain is localized, it's notcomplete, and there's additional opportunities there. And so we'll continue to bring the price downand expand margin -- costs down and expand margin even with this reduction in price that Elonmentioned on the standard range version of the vehicle.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. The next question is, Andy Grove once said that great companies are improved bycrises. In which way has Tesla improved or is expected to improve coming out of COVID-19?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it has caused us to look closely at our cost structure and to be more efficient as a company.That's -- one always has to do that in a crisis. And just thinking about our core beliefs and what dowe want to do, and we came to a conclusion that the right move is actually to continue to expandrapidly, continue to invest in the future and in new technologies, even though it is risky. And we'vetalked to some of our key investors, and they support that approach as well. So I think that there'sclearly an uncertain future ahead. It's a bit of a bumpy road.

In fact, a big part of it is just trying to communicate to people that this issomething you can do because normally, buying a car is quite a pain. For most people, they wouldrather go to the dentist than buy a new car. Actually, my dentist is great. But it's really like quite anarduous thing. When the typical retail experience for buying a new car is more painful to peoplethan having a root canal done, you have to say, well -- and for Tesla, it is completely as easy asordering something from the Apple App Store or ordering something on Amazon, and except it's acar.

2020/4/29,"And I think it would beone of the most exciting days in Tesla's history. And we're just trying to figure out the right timingfor that. We think probably the right timing will be the -- probably the third week of May. Notgiving a firm date, but we think that probably that's the right timing. And depending upon whatwe're allowed to do, it will either be in California or Texas.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. And the last question from institutional investors, could you please update on progresstowards development and commercialization of Full Self-Driving? How much revenue have yourecognized so far?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSo there's a couple of things on the financials for Full Self-Driving. So currently, in North America,it's sold for $7,000 as an option. We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of itgoes into deferred revenue. That's associated with features that will be released with time. Ourdeferred revenue balance is continuing to grow. It's a little bit over $600 million. And so as werelease features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have beenreleased, the associated value, and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into ourfinancials for that quarter. And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we canrecognize that revenue. So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenuewithin period. So I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful grossmargin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorAbsolutely. There's also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the fleet out there that couldupgrade to turn on Autopilot -- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving. And that's something that wewill enable just as simple in-app purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the end of theyear, as a subscription. So that's just a lot of untapped potential there. That's not in the deferredrevenue line, obviously, but is -- which is certainly a great deal of deferred potential that we think is-- a large portion of which is likely to reach fruition.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you.

This would be 4 million vehicles in 2025 and morethan 20 million vehicles in 2030. Is 40% a more realistic target?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it's always difficult to predict what the macro situation is going to be. I think very few peoplewould have predicted the unexpected roundhouse that COVID came up with -- it sort of came outof nowhere. So I think in the absence of something -- some massive force majeure event, like quitemassive, I think [50%] is the likely number. It's possible that it's 40%.

2020/4/29,"The next question is, can you give us an update on Solar Roof ramp? How many areyou currently able to install per week? What is your installation per week target for the end of2021?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWe were actually gaining tremendous momentum with the Solar Roof before COVID, but COVIDessentially shut us down, both from the ability to install and the ability to get permits, like permitoffices were closed. And with the shelter-in-place all over the places, so we obviously cannotinstall. And if you can't get permits, then you can't physically do it. It's physically impossible. So --but I think the long-term trend for Solar Roof is extremely good, and I'm confident that, let's say,within the next, I don't know, year -- maybe even by end of year, we should be installing at a rate of1,000 a week. That's not in the middle of winter or something. It's like taking seasonality --allowing for seasonality where it's hard to install on roofs that are covered in snow and ice, but likein, say, spring, I think installing, which is the hard part, we actually have demonstrated the ability tohit 1,000 a week gross build rate for the Solar Glass Roof already, so that's not a problem. It'sbuilding up the install teams, building up the third-party channel installers, the roofing industryinstallers.And internally, we want to have at least 1,000 Solar Roof install teams with -- and taking a week orperhaps a little less than a week to do an install, which gets you 1,000 a week roof installations. Wesee demand is good. Production is good. So it's really all about the install. And then like I said alsobuilding out the -- training the very diverse group of companies in the roofing industry to alsoinstall Solar Roof that I think will scale -- allow us to scale far beyond 1,000 a week. We're alsoseeing a lot of interest outside of North America.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, as I said on Twitter, I'm personally extremely excited to build a kick-ass HV AC system thatalso has sort of a hospital-grade particle filtration, basically have a filtration that filters out viruses,bacteria, pollen, fungi and also Neutralizes silicon and alkaline gases that is quiet and efficient. Andthese are all things we've achieved in our cars by the way. In fact, I don't know if a lot of peoplerealized, but the Model S and X are the only cars in the world that have a hospital operating roomgrade heavy filters built in. They're very big.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorZach?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. A couple of thoughts there for Y . The first is it does carry a higher ASP. So on the revenueside, it carries a higher ASP than Model 3. And the deliveries that we started with were of thehigher ASP versions of the cars. So we started with deliveries of performance initially. And so thathelps create some of the margin. And that will come down with time as more variants are released,and we have more of a steady-state mix. But it's similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model 3when we launched that product in Fremont 2 years ago.On the cost side, I think you hit on a couple of the buckets. The commonality is huge. It's veryimportant. And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to Model 3 as well.And so we have experience with that, both with Model 3 in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it's pretty much going to play out as it has played out, which is we'll release more and morefunctionality. Before we release any functionality, it goes through extensive testing. And of course,we run it -- we have a simulations team that has, I think, a very good simulation of the real world.So we run any car changes through a battery test and simulation. Then we have a global QA team,which I'm on actually, I'm one of -- on the global QA team. And we test the releases in the realworld, in the real-world map, [then if it fits] in the real world and the simulation, which is -- whichare very many because the world is very complex anyway.

Andthen we keep improving the reliability to a point where it no longer needs to be supervised by thedriver. And we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this is the case.

But for the restof it, I feel very good about where we are generally.Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-Founder & Head ofResearchSo to summarize, we want -- we're going to get owners full autonomy, some level of that by the endof the year and then a human in the loop, Tesla Network app sometime, is it first half of next year,would that be the hope?Elon R.

Musk - Tesla, Inc.","Elon Musk: I feel like we have a tremendous amount of momentum, and we'll have thefunctionality, that's the Full Self-Driving, by the end of the year. Now after that functionality is released, there's still another step, which is to improve the reliabilityof it once it is released. And then we keep improving the reliability to a point where it no longer needs to be supervised by the driver. And we provide a vast body of data to regulators to show them that this is the case.Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-Founder & Head ofResearch: When will we start seeing robotaxis?Elon R.

If it's a normal distribution, I'd giveyou the 50th percentile, not the 3 segment -- optimistic or pessimistic. So then that necessarilymeans at least half of my predictions will be wrong and half will be right. I think -- or it might beright but offset by a few weeks to a few months; in some cases, a few years. But I believe thateverything I've ever said would come true, did come true. It may come true late, but it did cometrue. So punctuality is not my strong suit, but I always come through in the end. So I think we couldsee robotaxis in operation with the network fleet next year, not in all markets but in some.","I think it's quite likely, in my view -- again, I could be wrong, I'm -- as you see it, we're aheadin some areas, and we're behind in others because -- when I give a guess, I give the guess that Ithink is the likely midpoint, not the point with lots of margin.

2020/4/29,"Our last question will come from Pierre Ferragu with New Street.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOne on gross margin, first, and your impressive performance in Q1. So there are 3 moving parts: thetailwind from credits, of course; the Model Y ramping, even if it broke even, it probably tookaverage gross margin down; and of course, you had like Fremont being closed, shut down the lastweek of the quarter, it probably was the sort of an extra cost. And so when I looked at how grossmargin evolved sequentially, excluding these 3 moving parts, I felt like your auto gross margincould have been up like a couple of points sequentially. So I wanted to check with you if thatestimate would make sense. And then I will have a follow-up on energy storage.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSequential market improvement -- margin improvement?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. So the 3 things that you mentioned, I had a little bit of a hard time hearing the full questionhere because we're having a bit of network difficulty in the room. I'll do my best here. So when welook at margin, we do exclude credit, as you have, so I agree with that. Model Y ramping, bringingdown overall gross margin, I agree with that as well. So it was lower than the overall average, andthat will increase with time. And shutdown and efficiencies in both Shanghai and in Fremont alsoweighed on margin, and the Shanghai margin was below the average as well. Even though it'sincreasing quickly and approaching Model 3, it still is below the average.And so I think the sentiment of your question was if you were to remove those factors, was there asequential increase in gross margin. I haven't specifically calculated that, but I think your intuition isright. We saw strength in gross margin across the board, as I mentioned. And in particular, S and Xgross margins continued to improve despite slightly lower volumes there and higher fixed costamortization.So there's good progress happening, both from the ASP side and the cost reduction side, for ourproducts and production.","Zachary J.

And it's also where we'll be doing -- we'll be doing Cybertruck there,the Tesla Semi, and we'll be doing Model 3 and Y for the eastern half of North America.Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California. So -- but we expectCalifornia to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the western half ofNorth America. And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would alsomake sense in California. So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California. And just toemphasize, we'll continue to grow in California, but we'll be creating a massive factory andCybertruck and Semi programs in Texas.So -- and I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much for -- to theTulsa team, the economic development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed. Thewhole Tesla team was super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for futureexpansion of Tesla down the road.Let's see. Is there anything more we want to say about? There's a lot of information. So anything,guys? All right. Well, I'm sure there'll be lots of questions.We've already started work on the facility, so some initial construction work. So it's alreadyunderway, started this weekend. Let's see, moving on to other subjects.Solar. We recently adjusted the pricing of our retrofit solar. So Tesla Solar is the lowest cost solar inthe United States. And we added the lowest cost guarantee and a money-back guarantee. So we'revery confident that people will have our solar product, whether it's the solar retrofit or Solar Roof.Our solar is now 30% cheaper than the U.S. average. After the federal tax credit, Tesla Solar nowcosts $1.49 per watt. And it's a very simple, highly automated single-click experience. So definitely,think about Tesla whether you want a new roof or Tesla Solar Roof or you want solar on yourexisting roof, either way, we're the company to go to.","Giga Texas is going to basically be an ecologicalparadise.

So I think that product is really coming together,and it's only going to get better later this year. So just very excited about that business potential.On the additional technology stuff, we introduced the first production car with more than 400 milesrange. So the current Tesla Model S now has an EPA-certified range of 402 miles. I mean youbasically can drive from L.A. to San Francisco nonstop and still have some miles left over whenyou arrive. And this is at highway speed. So you don't have to do anything, drive slowly oranything, drive -- you can just drive normally and go very long distances.And then for Full Self-Driving, we launched traffic lights and stop signs, and we continue toimprove that to make them more robust. And we're currently testing Full Self-Driving software forintersections and city streets and narrow streets. So I personally tested the latest alpha build of theFull Self-Driving software when I drive my car. And it is really, I think, profoundly better thanpeople realize. Yes, really profoundly better. It's like amazing. So it's almost getting to a pointwhere I can go from my house to work with no interventions, despite going through constructionand widely varying situations. So this is why I'm very confident about Full Self-Drivingfunctionality being complete by the end of this year. It's because I'm literally driving it.In conclusion, I'd like to again say thanks for all the hard work of the Tesla team, achieving our firstfull year of profitability in the company history. It was incredibly difficult. And just as a result ofthe hard work of a lot of people from Tesla worldwide. And yes, just think about the next 12 to 18months, we'll have 3 new factories in place.

While our AR balance isusually about 20% of revenue, it can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors. First, overall,less than 30% of our receivables is associated with new car sales. Second, due to payment termsassociated with financing and enterprise customers, settlement time lines for certain methods ofcash payments and geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated receivablesare impacted significantly by how many cars are delivered in the final weeks and days of thequarter. Third, roughly 40% of the balance is attributed to payment terms on regulatory credit salesand statutory EV incentive programs, both of which have been increasing. Customer depositsreduced slightly as well. Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the averagedeposit per order will continue to reduce, driving down this balance.As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and closeworking capital management.

You're thinking about the world in 3 dimensions, and the fourth dimension beingtime. So that architectural change, which has been underway for some time but has not really beenrolled out to anyone in the production fleet is what really matters for Full Self-Driving.So what we've been doing thus far has really just been with like 2D -- mostly 2D.

So -- and in order toachieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think isgoing to be primarily solar and followed by wind. And those are intermittent. So you need to have alot of batteries to store the energy because the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't alwaysshine.So there's like 3 elements of the sustainable energy future: wind and solar sustainable energygeneration; battery storage; and electric transport.

2020/7/22,"However, what we're seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiencyand sort of tire efficiency, drag coefficient, like basically, all of the things that -- our HV AC, goingto a heat pump, basically our total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model 3, forexample, that we actually are comfortable having an iron phosphate battery pack in Model 3 inChina. And that will be in volume production later this year.So we think that getting a range that is in the high 200s, basically -- but we think you probably get arange of almost 300 miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch ofpowertrain and other vehicle efficiencies. And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the TeslaSemi and the other projects that require higher energy density. So -- yes. So that's like 2 supplychains that you can tap into, iron phosphate or nickel. We use very little cobalt in our systemalready, and that's -- -- that may trend to 0 along -- especially when we got nickel.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThe next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard Range version of Model Y . Nolonger office -- offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi.Does this shift from smaller pack vehicles suggests that Tesla is not battery-constrained as in thepast? What are the biggest constraints now?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I'd just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel, okay?Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don't wait for nickel to go back tosome long -- some high point that you experienced some 5 years ago or whatever. Go for efficient,also environmentally friendly nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract fora long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way. Sohopefully, this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel.With regard to passenger vehicles, I think the new normal for range is going to be, just in U.S. EPAterms, approximately 300 miles. So I think people will really come to expect that as some numberclose to 300 miles as normal.","The new normal for range is going to be, just in U.S. EPA terms, approximately 300 miles.

2020/7/22,"That's a standard expectation because you do need to take intoaccount, like, is it very hot outside or very cold? Or are you driving up into a mountain with a fullload? And it's -- people don't want to have a -- get to their destination with like a 10 miles range.They want some reasonable margins. So I think 300 is going to be really -- or close to 300 is goingto be the new normal, close to 500 kilometers basically roughly.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThe next question on insurance. What is the holdup for Tesla insurance outside of California? Willyou release numbers from that part of the business? Will Tesla Insurance be required to participatein the Tesla ride-hailing network as a driver?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorSure.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. We're joking before the call that we get the quarterly insurance question that -- from say.comhere. We are working super hard on insurance. I'll go into a little bit more detail here than I have inthe past.Currently, we have a product in California. As I've described before, it's been quite well received.And I would largely describe it as a fairly standard insurance product with elements of it that areunique to our cars. So you can think of it as a version 1 of Tesla Insurance.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Version 0.9 is it getting at least.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFO0.9. What we're working on now is we can call it version 2, or we can call it the first version of ourtelematics product. And so really, ultimately, where we want to get to with Tesla Insurance is to beable to use the data that's captured in the car, in the driving profile of the person in the car, to beable to assess correlations and probabilities of crash and be able then to assess a premium on amonthly basis for that customer.And what makes this very exciting for us is the amount of data that is available, with the customer'spermission to use, is not available on any other product or any other vehicle in the world. So thisgives us a unique advantage in terms of information.","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes.

2020/7/22,"And we have a decision point here where wecould take the California product and replicate that into other states, or we could delay going intoadditional states and instead put more effort into the telematics side of this. And we chose the latter.And where we are now is nearly complete with the risk and cost analysis associated with the firstversion of the telematics product. We hope to be filing that in a handful of states with regulatorsvery shortly. And assuming that regulatory approvals go smoothly, we hope to have this in ahandful of states by the end of the year. And then we'll continue to file for approval in additionalstates. With regulatory approval there, we'll continue to roll this out nationwide as quickly as wecan. And then that product, as we continue to collect more data and reiterate on it, there'll beversion 2, version 3, et cetera, as we continue to refine that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean at the heart of being competitive with insurance is what is the accuracy of yourinformation. Like are you dealing with -- are you forced to assess people statistically looking in therear-view mirror? Or can you assess people individually, looking ahead with smart projections, andinform the driver that -- of how they may reduce their -- what actions they can take to reduce theirinsurance. As Zach was alluding to, it's like, okay, you're driving too fast, you're doing this or thator the other thing, it's like if you want to pay more for insurance, you can. But if you want to payless, then please don't drive so crazy. Then people can make a choice. Like, okay, they want to driveaggressively, in that case, it'll be higher insurance, or if they want -- they're more careful in theirdriving, they pay less.This was actually very helpful for us to have a feedback loop to see what is driving insuranceexpense.","Elon R.

2020/7/22,"A lot of it is just -- it's like a little fender bender and the net fender bender because of theway that the body collision repairs being done cost like $15,000 or something crazy, and like, well -- and then we can actually adjust the design of the car and adjust how the repair is done to actuallyhave the fundamental cost of solving that problem would be less.So this has helped us unearth a whole bunch of silly things that we were doing basically withoutrealizing it. But this is a problem, in general, with insurance, is like if the insurance is like all youcan eat, then the feedback loop for improvement is sweet. So this gives us a great feedback loop forimprovement because it's basically a fundamentally better insurance product.I'd also like to say, in the spurt of recruiting because if there's one thing I'd like to come out of thiscall, it's that a lot of great people want to join Tesla. That's the #1 thing I'd like on this call.And on the insurance front, I want to be clear. We're building a great, like a major insurancecompany.

It's a different type of insurance because of the use of the car. It's notdecided whether third-party insurance versus Tesla Insurance will be required.

2020/7/22,"Our first question will come from Dan Levy with Cr???©dit Suisse.Dan Meir Levy - Cr???©dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystI'll ask a question on the quarter and then just a question more broadly on strategy. Just on thequarter, if you could give us an update on gross margin. Was China accretive to gross margin in thesecond quarter? And give us an idea of how far off Model Y gross margin was versus FremontModel 3?And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in-sourcing is varying byregion. You're in-sourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you're relying a lot more on the supply chainin Shanghai. What do you expect your approach to be on insourcing when you eventually open upBerlin and what your Texas factory is going to be?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Just to start with the gross margin questions. We did see progress on gross margins in China,and that was despite pricing action that was taken. The factory is still not running at full capacityyet as it continues to ramp. So we think there's a continued opportunity to optimize the coststructure there.Model Y , as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production. And despitethe inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see a pretty substantial improvement inthe Model Y margin. And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structurewill converge. They're not quite there. Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, andit's not yet at full production. And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kindof back into the math there on the relative gross margins.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory. But -- and it's continuing to do more andmore internally. But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton ofparts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from everypart of the world. And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to thecost of the vehicle. And I mean the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like 5%to 10% a month.","Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Just to start with the gross margin questions.

2020/7/22,"Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystYou mentioned in the slide deck a couple of times that you were pleased with gross margin, withPTI margin progress and you expect it to achieve industry-leading operating margins over time.Maybe you could shed a little light on that. Industry-leading for luxury vendors is 8% to 10% PTI.For Porsche, smaller, at 17%. For mass market vendors, it's 5% to 8%. What do we think about?And how much, ultimately, do you believe that EV credits will contribute to that margin? Because Iknow your margin has been 5% over the last 12 months, but it's actually less than 1% excluding EVcredits. So it's a 4-point contribution right now. How do we think about ultimately what industry-leading margins are? And how much of that you think is coming from EV credits, regulatorycredits? And I have a follow-up, please.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. I've mentioned this before in terms of regulatory credit. We manage the business -- or saiddifferently, we don't manage the business with the assumption that regulatory credits will contributein a significant way to the future. I do expect regulatory credit revenue to double in 2020 relative to2019, and it will continue for some period of time. But eventually, the stream of regulatory creditswill reduce.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean it's worth noting that we're -- buyers of our car in the U.S. received 0 federal tax credit.Whereas many of our competitors are like, they get a $7,500 fed tax credit. And yet our sales havecontinued to do well. Yes.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce, manufacture and distributeour cars. That cost curve even for mature products like the S and the X continues to come down, aswe work on that, Model 3, which is our second most mature product, that continues to come down.You then layer on top of that, as Elon was discussing earlier, the potential for software-basedrevenue, particularly Full Self-Driving. There's the revenue recognition portion of that, that we havetoday. That will expand as we release more features.","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes.

2020/7/22,"And then you can layer on top of that in thefuture our revenue from the ride-hailing network.Operating expenses continue to come down and become more efficient as a percentage of revenue.There's still incredible opportunity there that we're working on, particularly on how customersinteract with the company from sales and service and what their flow is and how we get cars tothem. So we continue to see efficiencies there. So in the medium term here, what our modelingshows is in the low-teens operating margin level. And I think there continues to drive -- theopportunity to drive that up.So I hear your point on the 5% and the 1%. We're on a bit of a journey here, and we're continuing tobe [partners].A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystAnd if I could just follow up, Elon, you've talked a lot about the mission of the company in -- andreally trying to drive EV adoption globally. So how do you think about that trade-off betweendriving towards industry-leading profitability, yet trying to make your cars more affordable andbroader? It feels like, historically, you've always picked the path of, I'd rather drive more growthand more adoption because ultimately, that's the mission of the company. And we even saw it a littlebit this quarter with price reductions. You could have probably kept price where it is, sold someunits and had better profits, but that's been an ongoing choice that Tesla, as a company, has made.So how do you personally think about that trade-off between -- even if you were to get to industry-leading margins, wouldn't you be inclined to give more of that back to drive greater adoption morequickly?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I think we actually achieved both when you factor in autonomy. I think we can go waybeyond industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people and potentiallyalmost everyone when you're factoring in autonomy. That was really a mega game changer, gigagame changer. Yes. But I mean it is important for people to distinguish between 2 things. There'svalue for money that our product has, and then there's affordability. And even if you rail value formoney and have value for money like infinite, if people don't have enough -- if people do not haveenough money in their bank accounts to buy the car, they simply cannot.","Operating expenses continue to come down and become more efficient as a percentage of revenue.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Directorof Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2020 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ3 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. All right. So Q3 was our best quarter in history. We achieved record production anddeliveries, record revenue, record net income, both GAAP and non-GAAP, and record free cashflow of $1.4 billion. This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team. I could not bemore proud to work with such a great group of people. Just really (expletive) performance across --throughout the world.Of course, we had our Battery Day. So we hosted -- showed our plans for how we can expand in thefuture and improve core battery technology, core cell technology at the form factor level, chemistrylevel and I think most significantly at the manufacturing technology level. There's only -- acomment I made in the past is that I think Tesla's long-term competitive strength will be primarilymanufacturing. This is counterintuitive, but I'm quite confident this will be what happens.All right. So we presented what the team has been working on for a long time with batteries. Wewanted to step back and really rethink batteries from scratch. First principles thinking, just look at itfrom fundamental physics and say what -- rather than compare to other products in the market, justsay from a physics standpoint, if you -- what's the limit of physics? What's the platonic idea of aperfect cell and how close can we get there? And that was our aspiration.","Elon Musk: Q3 was our best quarter in history.

2020/10/21,"And I think we've got apretty good approach to it, which will only get better over time. And we went through all of theinteresting solutions for every important part of battery design and production. And we'll continueto iterate on that and just recursively improve the core cell and battery technology. The result, we think, in a few years, will be batteries that cost half as much and where the capitalexpenditures required are 1/3 or less of what they are today. And we expect Giga Berlin will see ourfirst battery cell production line at scale.Regarding the Full Self-Driving beta release. The Autopilot team, again, just a really all-star team. Ispent a lot of time with the Autopilot team. And there's a lot of really talented people in that teamwho've worked incredibly hard to make the -- to get the beta release out. So I'd just really like tothank them for their hard work. And it's just a very smart group of people. So I think we're startingvery slow and very cautiously because the world is a complex and messy place. And so we're -- weput it out there last night, and then we'll see how it goes and then probably release it to more peoplethis weekend or early next week. And then just gradually step it up until we have, hopefully, a widerelease by the end of this year.And of course, as the system collects more data and -- it becomes more robust. So it's sort of likehow does Google as a search engine get better. It's because everyone is programming it by askingquestions all the time and clicking on particular links. So it's got this great feedback loop, and thatmakes it an extremely effective search engine. It's the same thing for autonomy. Having on theorder of 1 million cars that are providing feedback and specifically feedback on strange corner casesituations that you just can't even come up with in simulation, this is the thing that is reallyvaluable. It's not like the obvious stuff, obvious stuff you can do in simulation. But weird cornercases, only a reality can give you that. So that's -- but we're able to say, okay, we need to train thesystem on this corner case situation and look for examples so we can then try it against thoseexamples and improve some very esoteric corner cases.And it's also important to emphasize that this is a generalized neural net-based approach.","The Autopilot team, again, just a really all-star team.

2020/10/21,"So it's really one of the most difficult challenges I've ever seen.So let's see. In conclusion, thank you. What we've achieved would not be possible without theincredible hard work of tens of thousands of Tesla employees and all people at our suppliers aswell. I'd like to thank our suppliers. We continue to grow as fast as we can while focusing on costcontrol and improving quality. And ultimately, the best company will be that which makes greatproducts at an affordable price, and that's our goal. I think I've never felt more optimistic about thefuture of Tesla than I do today. I'd also like to thank investors who have stuck with us through thickand thin. This is -- I think there's a lot more good stuff to come.All right.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorOkay. Sure.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. Overall, our financial health continues to rapidly improve with Q3 beinganother great quarter on nearly all dimensions, as Elon has mentioned. On net income, we achievedour fifth sequential quarter of profitability, our best net income, and nearly double-digit operatingmargins.Two things that are important to note to set context for Q3 profitability. First, the regulatory creditsbusiness was stronger than our expectations, and we are tracking to more than double this yearcompared to last. Second, as a result in the rise of the market cap of the company, the second andthird tranche of the CEO grant vested during the quarter. Additionally, we have begun expensing 1more tranche, resulting in roughly $300 million of combined period expense.I think it's reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the healthof the core business.On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from 18.7% to23.7%, with some of our programs achieving greater than 25% gross margin. Keep in mind thatinefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2. We continue to reduce ourmanufacturing and operational costs. We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend oflocally built and delivered cars, which has increased from under 50% at the beginning of last year toover 70% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction strategy.","Elon Musk: What we've achieved would not be possible without theincredible hard work of tens of thousands of Tesla employees and all people at our suppliers aswell.

Note that the majority of our operating cash flows are driven by thestrengthening of our core operations.Capital expenses grew to $1 billion, driven by Model Y investments in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin.As were previous investments in Model 3 Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont, we're expecting theseprograms to have already fully paid for their respective investments by the end of this year.Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, we have revised up our expectations for capital spending by $2billion to $2.5 billion, which we have ample liquidity and expected cash flows to fund. This isdriven by an increase in in-source scope for certain factories, including battery cell manufacturingas well as investments to enable greater capacity expansion in the future. While we expect thereturn on our investments to remain very strong, keep in mind that with additional scope andlocation-specific costs, the payback of these investments may be slightly longer than what we sawin Model 3 in Shanghai and Model Y in Fremont.Financing cash flows were $4.5 billion as we reduced use of our working capital lines, offset by a$5 billion equity raise in September.

I'll hand it over to RJJohnson, who joined Tesla earlier in the year and is leading our Energy business for a fewcomments.RJ Johnson - Tesla, Inc. - Global Head of Commercial EnergyThank you, Zach. First, I'd like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done. Q3 wasa strong quarter for the Energy business, and we're poised for continued strong growth in Energystorage and solar. Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business, anddeployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity. We have moredemand than supply through 2021, and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedenteddemand across the globe through 2023 and beyond. Our order book is rapidly filling up through2023 in a multiple gigawatt-hour scale.Large-scale solar plus storage is now more cost-effective than traditional fossil fuel generation inmany locations across the globe. This trend will continue as we remove cost, which will furtherdisplace existing and new fossil fuel generation. This is true for stand-alone storage as well.Many customers are utilizing Autobidder to maximize returns as we optimize our hardware andsoftware with advanced real-time bidding strategies that continue to outperform the market wheredeployed. For Powerwall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seekincreased reliability and backup home generation. We have a very large backlog of Powerwallorders, and we continue to invest to increase capacity to fulfill customer orders. We're just nowcapturing the full power of customer-sited solar plus storage as customers in some jurisdictions areproviding services back to the grid when they don't need to consume energy or have backup power.This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally.In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $1.49 a watt after taxincentives, which is the lowest in the industry. We're able to do this by leveraging our online vehicleordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft costs associated with sales andmarketing. As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiencyincrease, leading to increased profitability in the retrofit business.","Q3 was a strong quarter for the Energy business, and we're poised for continued strong growth in Energystorage and solar.

2020/10/21,"Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, everyone. And let's begin with questions from say.com. The first questionfrom retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start 4680 cell production at Giga Berlin at the sametime as vehicle production? Can Tesla share more information on what products will use the batterycells from the pilot line in Fremont?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Drew, do you want to take that?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSure. Yes, we will incorporate 4680 design solutions into many applications in time across bothenergy and vehicle. And we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the newfactory in Berlin as it ramps.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. Let's go to the next question, which is question #2 from retail shareholders.Does Tesla's tabless cell design allow for significantly higher peak charging rates? Does it improvethe required taper curve?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. The fundamental limitation on charge rate in lithium-ion batteries is avoiding lithium platingon the anode. And while the tabless architecture helps avoid overheating because it's a more power-dense architecture at high continuous charge rates, it doesn't change the anode plating story. Electrodesign and anode material choice more directly determines the maximum charge rate and how toavoid that lithium plating problem.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Thank you very much. The third question from retail is, would FSD be able to be transferredto our next vehicle or pay a transfer fee? It would add a broad -- it would add to brand loyalty thesame way gaming companies and cellphone companies keep you in their ecosystem by letting youtransfer purchases to upgraded hardware.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think we'll give it some thought.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay.

Looked like you could be approachingsomething like 20 million vehicles by 2030 if you hit those goals. Could you maybe share with us alittle bit more of a midterm target, like where would you be by 2025? And maybe give us a little bitmore insight into the investment required to get there, just to put that extra $2 billion to $2.5 billionper year into context.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean I think the tricky thing with trying to predict things midway through an exponential isthat if things are doubling every year or even just growing 50%, then if you shift 1 -- plus/minus 1year, it has a huge effect on the number. So -- and it sounds like, wow, you either massivelyexceeded or massively undershot. But it's -- actually, what's going on is a giant S-curve. So a wholebunch of pretty big S-curves that integrate into a gigantic S-curve. So that's why it's difficult topredict the middle. And I'm not saying for sure we'll hit 20 million vehicles. But it does seem like agood goal to have because that would mean that we're replacing 1% of the global fleet per year.And it's difficult to say that we're -- are we really changing the world if we're not switching out 1%of the global fossil fuel vehicles? I mean it's -- I'm not sure that we can make that argument unlesswe change at least 1% of the vehicles per year. So that's where the 2 -- the 20 million vehicle peryear comes from. It's like 1% of 2 billion vehicles, which is the global fleet currently. The globalfleet is growing. So probably will be a bit bigger in the future. So it's hard to say. It's like map an S-curve to a $20 million -- a 20 million vehicle target in 2030, and we will slide it around and seewhat that number looks like.

It'snot particularly material in the $10 million range for the quarter. With respect to product margins,what we're seeing across the board is just continued reduction in cost, really across every product.Shanghai continues to make good progress there. Model Y cost is also coming down quite quicklyas we ramp that. But we've guided in the past that Model Y cost should be roughly equivalent to theModel 3 built in Fremont costs. It's not quite there, and it's also a bit of a moving target. As Model 3Fremont cost comes down, Model Y also has to come down with that. But we're generally seeingstrength in Shanghai margin, strength in Model Y margins. And not too far off of this, we're seeingstrength in Model 3 Fremont, S and X margins.

So we'redesigning and building so much more of the car than other OEMs who will largely go to thetraditional supply base and like I call it, catalog engineering. So it's not very adventurous, and itbasically ends up like older products end up looking the same because they're going to the samesuppliers.So I mean, to the degree that you inherit legacy components, you inherit the legacy limitations andcost structure.

And the follow-up question I had was, during the Battery Day, you talked about this cellvehicle integration approach. It's very interesting.","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, I think you're probably right about that. I mean we're already seeing this in Australia, where we're seeing behind-the-meter aggregationthat is providing grid services back to the grid, which effectively reduces the price to the customerand reduces the prices for the grid operator. So you're seeing this trend happening across the globe. And it's going to be at the residential level as well as the wholesale level. So Megapack on one endand then Powerwall on the other side. Those 2 working together in tandem and the software layeron top of it, Autobidder being that, that really is going to help make the grid more efficient usingthe hardware platform and software together. And the follow-up question was, during the Battery Day, you talked about this cellvehicle integration approach. It's very interesting.",,
2020/10/21,"And when I look at that -- when I think about it, itlooks like this means that the skateboard designed that Tesla pioneered and many of your followersare using is going to become obsolete. Or am I not thinking about it the right way?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorIt will be obsolete long term, yes. I mean -- yes.Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Automotive AnalystAnd long term, are we talking -- yes?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI mean several years from now. It's not like existing cars stop having value. It's just that if you havea structural pack, where the pack is contributing structural value to the car because of like the -- sortof like the composite honeycomb effect of share transfer between upper and lower plate, thenanything that doesn't do that is going to have to have duplicate hardware. It's going to weigh more.It's going to cost more. And then the same goes for the front and rear castings.To be frank, we're trying to make the car like you'd make a toy. If you had a toy model car, howwould -- and then it's got to be real cheap and look great, how would you make that? You'll cast it.And that's how it's done. It would be absurd to make it up of tiny little pieces of stamp metal joinedin complex ways. So it's sort of a natural thing to do.And then the same goes for using the energy storage, the battery as a structure, which is done foraircraft wings and for rockets. The early rockets and aircraft, they had a separate aeroshell from thepropellant tanks or fuel tanks, and then they realized that doesn't make sense. And you've got tointegrate -- you've got to have your fuel tank in wing shape. You've got to have your propellanttanks in the shape of the body of the rocket, for example. You don't want to put a box on a box,basically. So -- which over many years made it like basically uncompetitive to have an aircraft thathas separate fuel tanks from the wings. The wings need to be fuel tanks. But like I wouldn't think ofthis as like it's like an overnight transition. It's several years.","Elon Musk: We're trying to make the car like you'd make a toy.

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Directorof Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2020 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ4 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So just to recap the year, 2020 was a defining year for us on many levels. Despite achallenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5million cars. And I'd just like to once again thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort. Wedelivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history. So really an incrediblegrowth rate and despite a very challenging 2020. So my hat is off. It's such an honor to work withsuch great people at Tesla.So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3billion on building new factories and other expenditures. We reached industry-leading GAAPoperating margins in addition to Positive net income and record cash flow.Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of newcapacity. We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and almost reached full productionspeed. We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, andShanghai continues to grow rapidly. We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.We ramped the single piece -- we started and we're able to ramp to volume production the single-piece castings for Model Y .","Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives will discuss Tesla's Q4 2020 Financial Results and Q&A Webcast.

2021/1/27,"This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeletonof the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in 1 year. We're also building Giga Berlinand Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year. And lastly, we built a cell -- abattery cell factory in the Bay Area. And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity islarge enough that it would be in the -- probably the top 10 battery cell factories on earth despitebeing a pilot plant.Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we're super excited to announce the newModel S and Model X Plaid are in production now and will be delivered in February. So we've beenable to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X. And so Model S will be delivered in February andModel X a little later. For the Model S Plaid, we're actually in production now and we'll bedelivering next month.So this is a tri-motor Model S with a completely new interior. There are actually a lot of great thingsabout this. I'll do another call about the Model S later. But it's really a tremendous improvementover the prior version.And the Model S will be the first -- this Model S Plaid will be the first production car ever that isable to go 0 to 60 miles an hour in under 2 seconds. So no production car ever has been able to getbelow 2 seconds, 0 to 60. This is a luxury sedan that is able to go 0 to 60 in less than 2 seconds andwill have the ability to seat up to 7 people with the third-row seats.So this is pretty nice. This is faster, to be clear, than any car. It's not like there was a different typeof car, like a 2-door sports car that was able to do fast -- it's the fastest accelerating car ever madefor -- that is allowed to go on roads in history. And like I said, we'll start delivering it in a matter ofweeks.And actually, we'll obviously get into the details what the Model S changes may be later this weekor next. But it's really better in many ways.","We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in 1 year.

2021/1/27,"We will be actually raising the price of Model S forthese new models of -- the old model -- the new model will be $10,000 more. So hopefully, peoplearen't too upset if they bought the old model last month. But this one, $10,000 more. So yes, wethink it's probably the best car of any kind at any price available in the world today.So then with regard to Full Self-Driving, we've made massive progress on Full Self-Driving. Irecommend watching the videos of our public beta. So we've got, I think, almost 1,000 people inthe beta at this point. And with each successful release of the beta FSD software, it just gets -- it'sreally improving rapidly. It's not very common for -- I drive the latest roads.It's very common for me to have no interventions on drives that I do, including drives to a place thatI've never been to. So these are not preplanned routes. The car has never been there before. And it'snow actually more -- it's more common than not for the car to have no interventions, even on acomplex drive. So -- and this is -- basically, I'm highly confident the car will be able to drive itselfwith reliability in excess of human this year. This is a very big deal.And thinking about like how does one justify the value of the company being where it is, I thinkthere is a way, just with back-of-the-envelope math, to potentially justify it, where if Tesla ships,let's say, hypothetically, $50 billion or $60 billion worth of vehicles and those vehicles become FullSelf-Driving and can be used in robotaxis -- used as robotaxis, the utility increases from an averageof 12 hours a week to potentially an average of 60 hours a week if they're capable of serving asrobotaxi. So that's like roughly a 5x increase in utility.But let's -- even if you say like, okay, let's just assume that the car becomes twice as useful as -- not5x as useful but merely twice as useful, that would be a doubling again of the revenue of thecompany, which is almost entirely gross margin. So it would mean -- it would be like if you made$50 million -- $50 billion worth of cars, it will be like having [$50 million] of incremental profitbasically from that because of the software.So -- and if that was the case, then yes, you get 20 PE on that.","Tesla will be raising the price of Model S forthese new models of -- the old model -- the new model will be $10,000 more.

2021/1/27,"It's like $1 trillion and the company isstill in high-growth mode. So I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of thecompany where it is using just the cars and nothing else, the cars with FSD. And I suspect at least anumber of investors are taking that approach.So in conclusion, while 2020 was a turning point for Tesla in terms of profitability, we believe thisis just the beginning. We think 2021 is going to be even more exciting. And you don't know what toexpect in a given year. Obviously, last year, we did not -- there were many things we did not expect.But assuming that '21 is a relatively normal year from an external standpoint, I think it's going to bea great year for Tesla.We've got a ton of -- many great new products coming out. We've got factories that are -- advancedfactories that can start production. It will also make it easier how you're having a factory in Berlin,one, and in Texas second, just from a logistics standpoint. And Texas can help supply the Easternhalf of the U.S. and Berlin can help supply Europe. And there's just fewer cars on boats, much lesscapital tied up with built cars that are on boats or going -- being transported to customers. And Ithink the fundamental efficiency of the company will be much better with the factories -- at leasthaving factories on each continent and having 2 factories in the U.S.So I'm super excited about the future, and yes, we look forward to making it happen. Thank you.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And I think our CFO, Zach Kirkhorn, has some opening remarks as well.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. As Elon mentioned, 2020 has been an extremely successful year whilemanaging through many unforeseen and unexpected challenges.On cash, we continue to generate strong free cash flows, reaching a record $1.9 billion in Q4alongside growth and investment for future programs. Additionally, we've been able to reduce ouruse of debt and various working capital lines, including settling $2 billion of convertible debt in Q4,which will continue into Q1.For net income, we achieved our first calendar year and 6 sequential quarters of profitability.","I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of the company where it is using just the cars and nothing else, the cars with FSD.

2021/1/27,"Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And now we can jump straight into questions from Say Technologies.The first question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from beingthe market share leader in solar?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So we're actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year. And we hadour best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4. So we do expect to become the market share leader insolar and then go far beyond it. It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had todevote the whole company to Model 3 production and building. And so we actually basically takethe whole company, including a lot of people that were on solar, and have them work on cars. Butnow we got a little more bandwidth, we're putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growingrapidly. So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOAnother really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure,which then allows us to have industry-leading pricing. And so that's something that we'veaccomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the place that it needs to be.And as Elon mentioned, this is a really important part with industry-leading pricing to become theleader in the space.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And actually, an important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwalland the Tesla retrofit solar and Tesla roof. And we're confident we'll have excellent integration --excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar, whether it's retrofit or the Tesla SolarglassRoof before the end of the year.So it's really -- I think we've got a good strategy. As Zach mentioned, we're focused on reducing theamount of time and the complexity of the install, and we're making great progress in that regard.And I think we'll have something that's really dialed in this year.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. The second question is, could current owners get ability to transfer their FSD to theirnext vehicle? This would be huge for loyalty and overall increase sales of vehicles while offeringmore FSD sales on the used vehicles.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc.","Elon R.

2021/1/27,"- Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorUnfortunately, we're not considering that at this time. We do actually offer an increased -- higherprice than -- for a car with FSD than the one without FSD. And I do think that the market currentlyundervalues -- the consumer market and arguably the stock market probably undervalue just howgood FSD is going to be.

And the third question is, can you give us a progress update on dry coatingof the battery electrode? At the Battery Day, Elon said, ""I would not say this is completely in thebag,"" as -- yet as the yields were low.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorDrew?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Sure. It's true, the in-house cell manufacturing system we revealed at Battery Day contains newprocesses and equipment. So we did expect some unknown unknowns and technical challenges toarise through the production ramp. The Kato team, however, has been able to solve eachmanufacturing problem presented to date and continues to improve yield and rate week-over-weekand month-over-month as we move up the production S-curve. At the same time, the cellengineering team's refined designs and deepened understanding has reinforced our confidence in thedrive process and 4680 design, meeting our performance and cost targets.And from a capacity perspective, we have 10 gigawatt hours worth of equipment landed at Kato.The production staff is nearly all hired. Our material supply chain is established and the team is ontrack for full production ramp this year. Meanwhile, we've developed enough engineeringconfidence with our 4680 design and the production process and equipment to kick offmanufacturing equipment and facility construction to support our 100 gigawatt hour 2022 goal.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay.

2021/1/27,"- Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we kind of talked about that, Drew. I mean essentially, what we're saying is that the numberto think about or focus on is like we've got a 100 gigawatt hour total Tesla cells produced in 2022.It's not that important to look at the run up to that because these things tend to improveexponentially. But we are installing capacity for -- in 2022 for 200 gigawatt hours a year, and wethink probably we should be able to achieve 30% of targeted design capacity in 2022.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Yes. Agreed, Elon. And as you've said before, with the S-curve of production, you can be off alittle bit on the initial part of the S-curve, and that makes a difference in absolute capacity by quite abit 1 month to the next. So yes, I mean we are progressing up that S-curve as fast as we possiblycan.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And we don't see any showstoppers.Andrew D.

What is Tesla doing toimprove service experience? Tesla had a reputation for outstanding customer service. Now it'simpossible to even call a service center, and appointments are scheduled weeks out. Jerome?Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionYes. Well, as far as best service, no service, so we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the qualityand the reliability of our cars. In the last 2 years, the frequency of service visits are reduced by 1/3.So people have to -- customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, noservice. And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in NorthAmerica. We're trying to push that to 50% this year. And 50% of service visits last less than 2hours. So we're trying to service the cars very quickly so people can get their vehicles back on theroad.And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve. We have about -- we have actually140 service centers right now in North America.","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we kind of talked about that, Drew.

2021/1/27,"For 100 out of those 140, you can getappointments in less than 10 days. And we're going to make sure all service centers are -- have ashort wait time.We're accelerating, as Zach mentioned earlier, the pace of opening. In North America, we opened11 centers in December, and we have plans to open 46 in the first half of this year. So that's whatwe're doing to improve service.In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app. Really, we want all communications to go throughthe app, the Tesla app, and we're trying to move away from the phone. The app is much better thanthe phone. It can start directly -- alerts directly from the car and schedule a service appointment.And there is a written record of all communication between the customer and the service team. Youcan have pictures in there. You can take care of your payment without entering the credit card anddoing all that stuff. You get updates on the service.And there is even more features that are going to come in the coming months on the app. And Ithink everybody will be happy, including the ability to spot where your service technician is andhow far it is to coming from your car and what's going on there. So we are investing everything onthe app, I think, just like most other companies as well, and that's the way of the future.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And now let's go to institutional investor questions. The question numberone, what are the key milestones we need to achieve in order to evolve current FSD to a commercialLevel 4, Level 5 ridesharing solution?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So it really goes back to what I was saying a moment ago, which is we need to transition overthe neural nets in the car to video. And in order to do that, the whole stack has to be -- the wholestack has to be changed to video. That means gathering video clips than using -- and this is actuallysurround video. So you've got 8 cameras operating simultaneously with synchronized frame rates.So you've got basically 8-frame surround video -- 8-camera surround video.","In North America, we opened11 centers in December, and we have plans to open 46 in the first half of this year.

2021/1/27,"Do we need to do things differently to win the Chinese EVmarket?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we currently are winning that -- we are currently the leader in the Chinese EV market. So Ithink we're must be doing something right if we're the best-selling electric car in China. That said,very few of our customers in China, I think maybe as low as 1% or 2%, actually have selected theFSD option. This is much lower than rest of world. So we definitely need to make it work well inChina.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, it is. So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability ofcells, what's the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours. And you can't grow faster than that. Nowat Tesla, we've improved the efficiency of our cars dramatically such that you can actually get apretty good range even with the Standard Range battery pack.It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the sort of high 200s. And withsome slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with the Standardpack, an order of 500 kilometers. So there's efficiency improvements in the car. But fundamentally,the growth is dependent on cell production. And there's obviously a lot of other companies thatwant to -- that have a need for cells.So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth.

2021/1/27,"In fact, I want to be really clear, Tesla wants to increasepurchases from cell suppliers. And we've been very clear with our cell suppliers, whether it beCATL or Panasonic or LG, that we will take as many batteries as they can produce. So -- and weurge them to increase their production, and we will buy as much as they can send to us.Obviously, there are some price limits on that because the car still needs to be affordable. But I'mjust trying to be as clear as possible that our goal with making our own cells is not todisintermediate our suppliers. It is to supplement our suppliers. And we want our suppliers of cellsto increase their production and in addition, have our production that is simply taking up theamount beyond which they are either unable or unwilling to increase their production.So it's an acceleration over and above the most that our suppliers say they can produce for us. Andso we -- since the cell output drives vehicle output, the -- and then -- I mean probably the broadbrushstroke value of Tesla is just what's the cell output that implies vehicle output and then at leastdouble that for autonomy revenue, [probably a whole new] level. And that's how you figure out thevalue of the company, I think, long term.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. The next question is about 4680 cells, which we already covered in the retailsection of this call. So let's go straight to the last question from institutional investors, which is,where are you in Cybertruck development? What are your expectations for Cybertruck deliveries in2021?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorAll right. So we finished almost all of the Cybertruck engineering. So we're no longer iterating atthe design center level or design level. We've got the designs fixed. We're getting to -- we'll soonorder the equipment necessary to make the Cybertruck work.We're obviously going to be using even bigger casting machines for the rear body of the Cybertruckbecause you've got -- obviously, it's a bigger vehicle and you've got a long truck bed that's going tosupport a lot of load. So we'll be using an 8,000-ton casting press for the rear body casting asopposed to 6,000 tons for Model Y .","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorAll right.

2021/1/27,"Our first question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.Colin William Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior AnalystCan you talk a little bit about the regulatory environment for FSD and how you're seeing that playout? Obviously, it's a bit of a moving target right now, and you guys are leading the way here, butwe'd love to understand how those conversations are going and how you see that impacting therollout of FSD throughout the balance of this year and into next year.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorOkay. Zach, do you want to -- Zach and Jerome?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOThe -- what we're seeing right now in the U.S., for example, is a pretty dynamic space, but it'soverall not particularly limiting on a rule basis. But what we're going to expect is to have to workwith regulators to demonstrate really, really high reliability, as Elon said before.The rest of the world is fairly dynamic. In Europe, we see a general slowdown, generally notreaching past Level 3 right now with some impetus to start working on new working groups toreach past that. And China showed an interest in working on Level 4 or even Level 5 later this year.So we expect a pretty dynamic 2021 in the regulatory space. We have leadership in the U.S. lookingfor manufacturers to demonstrate really good launches and really high reliability before releasing towider and wider groups.Colin William Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD and Senior AnalystAnd then just a quick follow-up around inflation on some of the materials markets. Obviously,there's a lot going on as low interest rates flow through the basic material space. Can you talk a littlebit about the supply chain and how you're managing some of your exposure around some of yourraw material costs?Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionThis is Jerome. Yes. For supply chain, the first priority now is to deal with the disruptions fromCOVID and shipping, in particular, boats between Asia and North America. But we're also lookingforward to pricing, and we're watching this very closely for all the components. We are entering aseries of long-term agreements with preferred suppliers to ensure that not only we're going to haveenough quantity to support the growth, 50% CAGR as Zach mentioned earlier, but also goodpricing with appropriate sharing of the risk.","The first question will come from Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.

2021/1/27,"And so what we'reable to do now that we haven't had the opportunity to do in the past is, as we're building capacity,particularly in Austin and Berlin, we can build that capacity with the expectation of what the endstate of capacity will be, pulling forward some of those investments rather than incrementallyadding capacity as we go along. And so this is an important part in terms of capital efficiency thatwe haven't had the luxury to do in the past, and it's great to be able to have the liquidity to focus onthat.And then more broadly, as Jerome was touching on, service expansion is really important to thefuture strategy of the company. So as you saw in our Q4 numbers, the expansion of service centersand mobile service from Q3 to Q4 increased quite a bit and was also quite a bit higher than the firstpart of the year. And so we're able now to make investments there and also in the Superchargingnetwork to get ahead of future demand, which will cost us more in the near term but is what theright long-term thing is for our customers and the company.","Service expansion is really important to thefuture strategy of the company.

2021/1/27,"Our next question will come from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler.Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior ResearchAnalystGreat. Was wondering, you mentioned how you'd like to increase your purchases of cells fromsuppliers. Does this require them to also have the capability to build structural 4680 cells of the sortthat you're putting in this -- these newer iterations of vehicles?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorNo, it does not. Although we are talking with them about making the 4680 form factor, but they -- itis not required. For example, the new S currently uses the 18650 form factor. So they're just a moreadvanced cell, and we think we'll continue to use that form factor for at least a few years. But wewill, over time, be retiring the form factors and try to move to a consistent form factor.So -- but it is not a requirement that we place on our suppliers because they would -- it would justresult in fewer cells. So it's better for us to deal with the complexity of different cell form factorsthan insist on a single form factor for our suppliers today. Like I said, over time, it will make senseto have a consistent form factor.Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior ResearchAnalystOkay. Makes sense. And then one additional maybe qualitative question on capacity expansion.You've mentioned in the past, I mean, access to dollars is one thing, but access to human beings thatare sufficiently qualified is another. Have you run up against any issues on that front that wouldpotentially limit your growth in any way?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThat is one of the things that -- or limits the growth rate. It doesn't limit the ultimate size. It limitsthe growth rate, which is what's the rate at which we can onboard great people and get them trainedin the right areas.You usually can't like instantaneously -- if you've got a factory that has 20,000 employees, you can'tjust hire 20,000 people instantly.

2021/4/26,"But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaGreat. Thank you. So Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels. Tesla achieved recordproduction, deliveries and surpassed $1 billion in non-GAAP net income for the ï¬?rst time. Andwe've seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and our demand is the best we'veever seen. So this is -- [we're talking about] we're used to seeing a reduction in demand in the ï¬?rstquarter, and we saw an increase in demand that exceeded the normal seasonal reduction in demandin in Q1.So Model 3 became the best-selling midsized premier sedan in the world, in fact, I should say thebest-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world. The BMW 3 Series was for the longest time thebest-selling premium sedan, has been exceeded by the Tesla Model 3. And this is only 3.5 yearsinto production and was just 2 factories. For Model 3 to be outselling its combustion enginecompetitors, I think, is quite remarkable.In the past couple of quarters, we delivered roughly 0.25 million Model 3s, so -- which translates toannualized rate of 0.5 million per year.When it comes to Model Y , we think Model Y will be the best-selling car or vehicle of any kind inthe world and probably next year. So I'm not 100% certain next year, but I think it's quite likely. I'dsay more likely than not, that in 2022, Model Y is the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the world.Then with regard to Full Self-Driving. Full Self-Driving beta continues to make great progress. It isdeï¬?nitely one of the -- I think one of the hardest technical problems that exists, that's maybe everexisted. And really, in order to solve it, we basically need to solve a pretty signiï¬?cant part ofartiï¬?cial intelligence, speciï¬?cally real-world artiï¬?cial intelligence. And that sort of AI, the neuralnet needs to be compressed into a fairly small computer, a very efï¬?cient computer that wasdesigned, but nonetheless, a small computer that's using on the order of 70 or 80 watts. So this is amuch harder problem than if you were you, say, 10,000 computers in a server room or somethinglike that.This has got to ï¬?t into a [smaller sprain]. And this -- I think with the elimination of radar, we'reï¬?nally getting rid of one of the last crutches. Radar was really -- it was making up for some of theshortfalls of vision, but this is not good.","Q1 2021 was a record quarter on many levels.

And when [beam]works, it works better than the best human because it's like having 8 cameras, it's like having eyesin the back of your head, beside your head and has 3 eyes of different focal distances lookingforward. This is -- and processing it at a speed that is superhuman. There's no question in my mindthat with a pure vision solution, we can make a car that is dramatically safer than the average[person].So -- but it is a hard problem because we are actually solving something quite fundamental aboutartiï¬?cial intelligence, where we basically have to solve real-world vision AI. And we are. So -- andkey to solving this is also having some massive data set. So just having well over 1 million cars onthe road that are collecting data from very sort of corner case rare situations -- sort of like so manyweird things in the world like a truck carrying a truck or a car with -- one example is like a car as anactual example, a car with the kayak on the roof where the kayak has a little weight dangling fromthe front of the kayak in front of the car and -- but yet the car must ignore this and just look at theroad.So it's really quite tricky, but I am highly conï¬?dent that we will get this done. So -- yes. Thisquarter, and I think we'll continue to see that a little bit in Q2 and Q3. So Q1 was -- had some of themost difï¬?cult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla and samedifï¬?culties with supply chain, with parts -- over the whole range of parts. Obviously, people haveheard about the chip shortage. This is a huge problem. But then in addition to that, for example, wehad quite a difï¬?culty scaling, driving our production in China because we're unable to get criticalengineers there because of COVID quarantine restrictions. So -- which meant that Tesla worldwidewas dependent on drive units made at our factory in Nevada, Giga Nevada. So that was a verychallenging situation.I think we're mostly out of that particular problem. That's just -- those was just 2 of manychallenges. So the team has really done an incredible job of dealing with really severe supply chainshortages.So with respect to the Model S and X, there were more challenges than expected in developing theModel S or what we call the Palladium program, which is the new version of Model S and X, whichhas revised interior and new battery pack and new drive units and new internal electronics and has,for example, a PlayStation 5 level infotainment system.","Q1 was -- had some of themost difï¬?cult supply chain challenges that we've ever experienced in the life of Tesla.

2021/4/26,"There's just a lot of issues encountered,ensuring that the new factory was, [as also we're saying] was quite hard because we were workingmore energy in a smaller pace. So it took quite a bit of of development to ensure that the battery ofthe new S/X is safe. And we're trying to get all the -- in the cars slowly for the past few months. Butwe're just stacking them up in the yard and just making reï¬?nements to the cars that we built. But wedo expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month. And then tobe in sort of fairly high volume production for the X in Q3 and start delivering Model X in Q3 aswell.So I think as we ramp up, I think probably the demand for the new S/X will be quite high. So it'sreally just going to be a question of ramping supply chain and internal production processes. Soprobably, like, we're going to aim to produce over 2,000 S/X per week. Perhaps if we get lucky,upwards of 2,400 or 2,500. This again is contingent on global supply chain issues, which is just alot of factors outside of our control here. But I do think [these will get solved], so it's just a matterof time, and then we'll be doing well over 2,000 S/X per week. It's a great car. It actually costs usless to produce, a little bit less to produce, but it is a superior product.So in conclusion is there's a lot to be excited about in 2021 and '22. We're building factories asquickly as we can. Both Texas and Berlin are progressing well, and we expect to have initial limitedproduction from those factories this year and volume production from Texas and Berlin next year.At this time, we are continuing to ramp production of Model Y in Fremont and Shanghai. In thebackground, we're continuing work -- development work on the Semi, Cybertruck, the Roadster andother products. Thanks to everyone at Tesla who made this year a huge success. Now on toquestions.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. We have some remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn as well.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaOkay.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of CoinYes. Thanks, Martin. Thanks, Elon. So congratulations to the Tesla team on breaking multiplerecords in the ï¬?rst quarter of '21, as Elon had mentioned, which is typically the most difï¬?cult of theyear for many reasons.To summarize the quarter, I think it's best understood by 3 key items.","We expect to ramp Model S production and start delivering them probably next month.

Thanks to everyone at Tesla who made this year a huge success. Now on toquestions.",,
2021/4/26,"First, we successfullylaunched and began the ramp of Model Y in Shanghai, achieving positive gross margin in the ï¬?rstquarter of production and receiving a great reception from the market. Second, as Elon mentioned,although we began the production process for the Model S during the quarter, we had not yet beguncustomer deliveries. The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningfulheadwind to free cash ï¬?ows and proï¬?t generation.For example, we incurred an estimated $200 million of direct P&L impact relating to this programin Q1, the majority of which is reï¬?ected in COGS and that's before even considering the impact oflost revenue and proï¬?ts as a result of the transition. And as he mentioned -- as Elon mentioned, weexpect the ï¬?rst deliveries to begin shortly.Third, as we continue to work through the instability of the global supply chain, particularly aroundsemiconductors and port capacities, while the Tesla team in partnership with our suppliers didtremendous work keeping our factories running, we did experience high expedite costs in thequarter, and they were also higher than they were in Q4, with some minor interruptions toproduction over the course of the quarter. We believe that this landscape is improving, but it doesremain difï¬?cult, and it's an evolving situation.If we double-click within net income. Auto gross margin, excluding credits, improved sequentiallyand year-over-year. This is in spite of the cost mentions for S and X and expedites and a reductionin global ASPs as our cost structure as a company is reducing at an even faster pace. So as we lookout over the course of the year, we feel optimistic about our gross margin strength, particularly assome of these headwinds we're experiencing start to be resolved.On services and other margins, these have recovered and are trending towards proï¬?tability, aided bystrength in the used car business, operational improvements in service and additional servicerevenue opportunities that help absorb ï¬?xed overhead.On energy gross margins, these remained negative for second quarter. This is driven by solar-relatedramp costs and winter seasonality in the lease PPA business. We continue to manage through amulti-quarter backlog on Powerwall. We're working as fast as we can to increase production. Andthis will aid in proï¬?tability of this business as those volumes increase.On operating expenses, these increased for Q1, which is driven by our investments in technologyand growth. In particular, for R&D, this includes the structural battery pack and 4680 cells,investments in the new S and X and our neural net and silicon investments.On the SG&A side, we're setting up infrastructure and support for both China and EMEA inanticipation of volume to come there.","The reduction in Model S and X deliveries from Q4 to Q1 were a meaningfulheadwind to free cash ï¬?ows and proï¬?t generation.

2021/4/26,"And as I said before, our plans show that we remain on trackfor sustained industry-leading operating margins.Double-clicking on cash ï¬?ows. We continue to generate positive free cash ï¬?ows, and this wasdespite the signiï¬?cant working capital headwinds from S and X. Additionally, we are makingprogress reducing various forms of debt. We also invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin during the quarter,then trimmed our position by 10%, which contributed to a small gain in our Q1 ï¬?nancials.Taking a step back, we've generated $8 billion in operating cash ï¬?ows and $4 billion in free cashï¬?ows over the past 4 quarters. As we look forward, our plans remain unchanged for long-termgrowth of 50% annually, and we believe we're on track to exceed that this year as we guided to lastquarter. Global demand remains meaningfully higher than production levels. And so we're drivingas fast as we can to increase our production rates. As we think about Q2 and Q3, these quartersshould largely be driven by execution on S and X, as we've discussed, continued ramp of Model Yin Shanghai and the associated cost reductions of these programs. And we expect proï¬?tability andcash generation to evolve over the course of the year in line with those improvements.And then as we get towards the end of the year, our story will pivot towards the launch and ramp ofour newest factories in Austin and Berlin. So there's certainly no shortage of exciting things for usto work on and look forward to. Thank you, and we'll open it up for questions.Questions and Answers:Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And we'll ï¬?rst take retail questions from, say, website. The ï¬?rst question is,how is Dojo coming along? Could Dojo unlock an AWS like business line for Tesla over the nextfew years?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of CoinYes. I'll jump in here. So with respect to Dojo...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaSorry, Zach. My apologies. I was on mute.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of CoinGo ahead, Elon.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaSo yes, I was just basically saying that the -- although like right now, people think of Tesla as -- alot will think of Tesla as a car company or as an energy company. I think long term, people willthink of Tesla as much as an AI robotics company as we are a car company or an energy company.","Our plans remain unchanged for long-termgrowth of 50% annually, and we believe we're on track to exceed that this year as we guided to lastquarter.

2021/4/26,"Ithink we are developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world.Certainly, we appear to be able to use things with full self-driving that others cannot. So if you lookat the evolution of what technologies we developed, we developed them in order to solve theproblem of self-driving. So we couldn't ï¬?nd a powerful enough neural net [in terms of a] computer.So we designed and built our own.The software out there was really quite primitive for this task. And so we built the team fromscratch and have been developing what we think is probably the most advanced real-world AI in theworld. And then it sort makes sense that this is kind of what needs to happen because the roadsystem is designed for a neural net computer, our brain. Our brain is neural net computer. And it's --the entire road system is designed for vision with a neural net computer, which is because it'sdesigned for eyes in the brain. And so if you have a system which has very good eyes, you can seein all directions at once, you can see 3 focal points ahead or forward, but it never gets tired. It'snever sort of texting. It has redundancy and its reaction time is super human. Then it seems prettyobvious that such a system would achieve an extremely high level of safety, far in excess of theaverage person.So that's what we're doing. Then Dojo is kind of the training part of that. So because we're -- wehave over 1 million cars, and perhaps next year, we'll have 2 million cars in active use, providingvast amounts of video training data that then needs to be digested by a very powerful trainingsystem. And currently, we use Tesla training software. So we developed a lot of training software, alot of labeling software to do, to able to do surround video labeling, which is quite tricky. Thismeans all 8 cameras simultaneously at 36 range a second per camera labeling video over time.There wasn't any tool that existed for this, so we developed our own labeling tool.Then taking it a step further, obviously, the Holy Grail is auto labeling. So now we're getting quitegood at auto labeling, where we do -- where -- that the trainers train the training system and then thesystem auto labels the data and then the human laborers just need to look at the labeling to conï¬?rmthat it is correct and perhaps make edits.","The company is developing one of the strongest hardware and software AI teams in the world.

2021/4/26,"And then every time an edit is made, that further trains thesystem. So it's kind of like a ï¬?ywheel that's just sort of spinning up. And really, the only way to dothis is with vast amounts of video data.So then we need to train this efï¬?ciently. So Dojo is really a -- it is a supercomputer optimized forneural net training. We think Dojo will be, probably in order of magnitude, more efï¬?cient on, say --not sure what the exact right metric is, but say, per frame of video, we think it will be an order ofmagnitude more cost efï¬?cient in hardware and in energy usage for a frame of video compared to aGPU-based solution or compared to the next best solution that we're aware of.So then possibly that could be used by others. It does seem as though over time -- I mean just anobservation, I think basically is the fact that neural net based computing or AI-based computing isand more and more of the compute stack. We -- conventional computing -- well, perhaps heuristics-based computing is still going to be important, still going to be very important, but it will become --but neural net will become a bigger and bigger portion of compute. So a long story, but I think, yes,probably others will want to use it too, and we will make it available.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRLet's go to the second question from retail investors. The recent price changes on solar roof havebeen discouraging for customers and investors. Could just like share more about solar roofchallenges? And if the outlook has changed at all, i.e., 1,000 roofs per week.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaYes. First of all, I should say that the demand for the solar roof remains strong. So despite raisingthe price, the demand is still signiï¬?cantly in excess of our ability to meet the demand to install thesolar roofs. So production is going ï¬?ne, but we are [curbed] at the installation point. We did ï¬?ndthat we basically made some signiï¬?cant mistakes in assessing the difï¬?culty of certain roofs, but thecomplexity of roofs varies dramatically. Some roofs are to be literally 2 or 3x easier than otherroofs. So you just can't have a one-size-ï¬?ts-all situation. If a roof has a lot of protuberances or if theroof sort of -- the core structure of the roof is rotted out or is it not strong enough to hold the solarroof, then the cost can be double, sometimes 3x what we -- what our initial quotes were.","Dojo is really a -- it is a supercomputer optimized forneural net training.

2021/4/26,"So in thosecases, what we obviously opt to do is to refund customers their deposit and -- but what we cannotdo is go and just lose a massive amount of money. We just got to provide a refund of the earlydeposit.But that's what is, I think, most important about the solar roof situation, which I tweeted about thispast week, is that we're shifting the whole sort of solar situation -- the solar power -- well, basically,solar power situation to there's only 1 product basically -- or there's only 1 conï¬?guration. Everyhouse -- we will not sell a house solar without a Powerwall. That solar could either be solar retroï¬?twith conventional panels put on the roof or it can be the Tesla Solarglass Roof. But in all cases, itwill have the power to -- technically, this is -- it's actually Powerwall 2 plus, if you will. The plusrefers to a higher peak power capability.So basically, all Powerwalls made since roughly November of last year have a lot more peak powercapability than the speciï¬?cation on the website. They have about twice the power capabilityroughly. It depends on how you count power, but about twice the peak power and about arguablytwice the steady-state power of the speciï¬?cation of the website. The energy is the same, but thepower is roughly double. And all the installations -- so all installations will have a Powerwall. Andthe difï¬?culty installation will dramatically -- or the difï¬?culty of the installation will be much less. Itwill be much easier because the power from the solar roof -- Solarglass Roof or the solar panels willonly ever go directly into the Powerwall. And the Powerwall will only ever go between the utilitymeans -- between the utility and the main power panel of the house, which means you never need totouch the main circuit breakers of the house. You never need to touch the house circuit breakers.Effectively, almost every house, therefore, looks the same electrically instead of being a uniquework of art and requiring exceptional ability to rewire the main panel.So this is extremely important for scalability is. It's the only way to do it, really. And this alsomeans that every solar Powerwall installation that the house, or whatever the case may be, will beits own utility. And so even if all lights go out in the neighborhood, you will still have power. Sothat gives people energy security.And we can also, in working with the utilities, use the Powerwalls to stabilize the overall grid.","Tesla's Powerwalls have about twice the power capability than the speciï¬?cation on the website.

It will be much easier because the power from the solar roof -- Solarglass Roof or the solar panels willonly ever go directly into the Powerwall.",,
2021/4/26,"Solet's say that there's a -- like there was in Texas, there was a peak power demand, and the powerdemand, because the grid lacked the ability to buffer the power, they had to shut down power.There's no power storage. No good point on power storage. However, with a whole bunch ofPowerwalls and houses, we can actually buffer the power. And so if the grid needs more power, wecan actually then, with the consent, obviously, of the homeowner and in partnership with the utility,we can then actually release power onto the grid to take care of peak power demand.So effectively, the Powerwalls can operate as a giant distributed utility. This is profound. I'm notsure how many of you will actually understand this but this is extremely profound and necessarybecause we are headed towards a world where, as we were just talking about earlier, where peopleare moving towards electric vehicles. This will mean that the power needs in -- at homes andbusinesses will increase signiï¬?cantly. We will -- there will need to be a bunch more electricitycoming somewhere. In fact, if you go to full renewable electricity, we need about 3x as muchelectricity as we currently have. So these are rough numbers, but roughly you need twice -- roughlyneed twice much electricity if all transport goes electric, and they need 3x much electricity if allheating goes electric. So basically, this is a prosperous future, I think, both for Tesla and for theutilities.Because -- and in fact, I think this will be very -- if this is not done, the utilities will fail to servetheir customers. They won't be able to do it. They won't be able to react fast enough. And we'regoing to see more and more of what we see, say, in California and Texas of people seeingbrownouts and blackouts and the utilities not being able to respond because there's a massivechange going on with the transition to electric transport. And we're seeing more extreme weatherevents. This is a recipe for disaster. So it is very important to have solar and batteries at the locallevel, at the house.In addition, it is important to have large battery storage at the utility level, so that solar and wind,which are the main forms of renewable electricity, can be -- that electricity can be stored becausesometimes the wind doesn't blow, sometimes it blows wide. Sometimes it blows too much andsometimes it didn't blow enough. But if you have a battery, you can store the energy and provide theenergy to the grid as needed.","Tesla CEO: Powerwalls can operate as a giant distributed utility. We are headed towards a world where, as we were just talking about earlier, where peopleare moving towards electric vehicles. This will mean that the power needs in -- at homes andbusinesses will increase signiï¬?cantly. If you go to full renewable electricity, we need about 3x as muchelectricity as we currently have. So basically, this is a prosperous future, I think, both for Tesla and for theutilities, says Elon Musk, CEO of electric car maker Tesla, in an interview with CNN.",,
2021/4/26,"The same goes for solar because, obviously, the sun does not shine atnight and sometimes it is very cloudy. And so by having battery storage paired with solar and wind,this is the long-term solution to a sustainable energy future.And as I said, it needs to occur both at the local level and at the utility level. If it doesn't occur at thelocal level, what will actually be required is a massive increase in power lines in power plants. Sothey have to put long distance and local power lines all over the place. They'll have to increase thesize of the substations, is a nightmare. This must occur. There must be solar plus battery. That's theonly way. So yes.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And the next retail question is, master of coin, can you tell us anything aboutTesla's future plans in digital currency space or when any such major developments might berevealed?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of CoinSure. Thanks, Martin. So as I noted in our opening remarks and we've announced previously, soTesla did invest $1.5 billion into bitcoin in Q1, and then we subsequently sold a 10% stake in that.We also allow customers to make vehicle deposits and ï¬?nal vehicle purchases using bitcoin. And sowhere our Bitcoin story began, maybe just to share a little bit of context here. Elon and I werelooking for a place to store cash that wasn't being immediately used, trying to get some level ofreturn on this, but also preserve liquidity. Particularly as we look forward to the launch of Austinand Berlin and uncertainty that's happening with semiconductors and port capacity, being able toaccess our cash very quickly is super important to us right now. And there aren't many traditionalopportunities to do this or at least that we found and in talking to others that we could get goodfeedback on, particularly with yields being so low and without taking on additional risk orsacriï¬?cing liquidity. And Bitcoin seemed at the time and so far has proven to be a good decision. Agood place to place some of our cash that's not immediately being used for daily operations ormaybe not needed till the end of the year and be able to get some return on that.And I think one of the key points that I want to make about our experiences in the digital currencyspace is that there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic here.","Batteries paired with solar and wind is the long-term solution to a sustainable energy future.

2021/4/26,"We're certainly watching it very closely atTesla, watching how the market develops, listening to what our customers are saying.

So our ability to build our ï¬?rst position happened quickly. When wedid the sale later in March, we also were able to execute on that very quickly.And so as we think about kind of global liquidity for the business in risk management, being able toget cash in and out of the market is something that I think is exceptionally important for us. So wedo believe long term in the value of bitcoin. So it is our intent to hold what we have long term andcontinue to accumulate bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles.Speciï¬?cally with respect to things we may do, there are things that we're constantly discussing.We're not planning to make any announcements here, and we're watching this space closely.

Just let me jump in on the vampire drain. That's deï¬?nitely not the issue. Good lithium ion cellself discharges less than 0.001% of its energy per day. So it's -- this vampire drain is maybe notthat...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaI just love they call it vampires.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Yes, I think the challenge with seasonal storage is your value proposition drops from hundredsof useful full cycles per year to less than maybe 10 or maybe even less than 5 cycles per year. So it'sjust a different type of technology altogether that would make sense, given that it's more than anorder of magnitude, different use case.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaYes. We've got a long way to go before we're dealing with seasonal technology issues.","Autosteer did not and could notengage on the road condition that -- as it was designed. Our adaptive cruise control only engagewhen a driver was buckled in about 5 miles per hour. And it only accelerated to 30 miles per Hour with the distance before the car crashed. We're unable to recover the data from the SD card at the time ofimpact, but the local authorities are working on doing that, and we await their report. Yes, I think the challenge with seasonal storage is your value proposition drops from hundredsof useful full cycles per year to less than maybe 10 or maybe even less than 5 cycles peryear. So it'sjust a different type of technology altogether.",,
2021/4/26,"But certainlya way to deal with seasonal technology would be to have wind and solar erring on the side of more[sublay] latitude and -- but then across a variety of longitude. So essentially, like let's say, in theU.S., for example, if there was a -- I'm not sure if you'll understand this, you can actually power theentire United States with just sort of 100 -- roughly a 100-mile -- by a 100-mile grid of solar. Somepeople don't quite understand like, well, how much solar is needed to power the United States.Almost nothing of the (inaudible) of almost any country in the world.The solar incident is a gigawatt per square kilometer. This is insane. In fact, you took the clear area,just the area or saying for nuclear power plants, the area that is considered not usable because of anuclear power plant is there, in most cases, if you just put solar there, it would generate more powerthan the nuclear power plant because they typically have pretty wide clear areas. So it really -- so ifyou have, say, 25% efï¬?cient solar panels and then those are 80% efï¬?cient in how they laid out,you're going to do about 200 megawatts per square kilometer. Therefore, [5 straight] kilometers is agigawatt, which might be a typical sort of power plant. It's really not much area at all. And a lot ofplaces can have wind and solar in place.So anyway, it's entirely possible to power all of earth with a small percentage of earth's area. Andthen to transfer that power through high-voltage DC lines with no new technology. No -- you don'tneed like room temperature superconductors. This another room temperature superconductors. Thisis a total -- also another myth. Room temperature superconductors, almost irrelevant, in my opinion,almost irrelevant. Low-cost, long-distance power lines using copper or aluminum is very important.So heating is [ice where are]. So that's current square type of resistance. So as you increase voltage,you can drop the current dramatically and drop the heating dramatically to the point where it is ofminor relevance, like maybe you lose 5% to 7% with a high-voltage DC power line, something likethat.So I want to be clear. (inaudible) no new materials are necessary. We just need to scale this thing up.We -- the technologies exist today to solve renewable energy. And some people will say, well, whydon't we do it? That's because the energy basis of the earth is gigantic, super mega insanelygigantic.","The energy basis of the earth is gigantic, super mega insanelygigantic.

2021/4/26,"So you can't just go and do 1 zillion terawatts overnight. You've got to build theproduction capacity for the cells, for the battery cells, for the solar cells. You've got to put that intovehicles. You've got to put that into (inaudible) storage packs. You've got to put that into solarpanels and Solarglass Roofs, and you've got to deploy all this thing -- all this stuff.But it is certainly the case that we can accelerate this. And we should try to accelerate it. And theright thing to do, I think, from an economic standpoint, and I think an economist to agree is to havea common tax, just as we have a tax on cigarettes and alcohol, which we think are more likely to bebad than good, and we tend to tax fruit and vegetables less. It was the same should be true. Weshould tax energy that we think is probably bad and support energy we think is probably good, justlike cigarettes and alcohol versus fruits and vegetables. This is common sense.And -- but I guess on the plus side, I'm not suggesting anyone be complacent. But sustainableenergy, renewable energy will be sold, it is being sold, but it matters how fast we sold it. And if wesold it faster, that's better for the world. There's no question in my mind whatsoever that the energystorage problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, zero. I want to be clear, zero.I think the bias will tend to be towards iron-based lithium-ion cells. When we say lithium-ion, youwill think lithium must be a big constituent of the cells. It's more like 1% to 2% of the cell islithium. But the main part of the cell is the cathode, the main mass and cost in the cells is thecathode. For high-energy cells, like for example, what we use in most -- most Teslas have nickel-based lithium-ion cells, which have higher energy density, longer range than iron-based cells.However, stationary storage, the energy density is not as important because it's just staying on theground. And so I think the vast majority of stationary storage will be iron-based lithium-ion cellswith an iron phosphate cathode technically. But I think the phosphate part is unnecessary, so is theiron ore nickel. I'm destroying the terminology. Just think of it as iron and nickel. And there's aninsane amount of iron in the world, more iron than we could possible use. And there's also morelithium than we could possibly use.","There's no question in my mind whatsoever that the energystorage problem can be solved with lithium-ion batteries, zero.

2021/4/26,"Basically, there is no shortage of anything whatsoever in ironplus base lithium-ion cells.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. Let's go to the next question from institutional investors, which is yousuggested that between a 5x to 10x improvement is achievable in the automotive production versusthe ï¬?rst Model 3 line on the ï¬?rst principles physics analysis. Where does Berlin sit relative to thatlimit?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaI think we're still quite far away from it. I mean the thing to bear in mind with production is -- forthose who've never done production, they just don't understand how insanely hard production is. Iwant to really be very, very emphatic here. Prototypes are trivial, they're child's play. Production ishard, is very hard. Now you say production at large scale with higher liability and low cost,insanely difï¬?cult. But Tesla achieved on the automotive side was not to create an electric car. Thetruly profound thing on the car side is that Tesla was the ï¬?rst American car company to achievevolume production of a car in 100 years and not go bankrupt.So this is -- this -- basically, myself and many others at Tesla had to basically have severalaneurysms to get this done. It was so hard to have no idea. So anyway -- and the thing about makinga large complex manufacturing object is, let's say you have ï¬?rst-order approximation, 10,000unique items. And even one of those items is slow, that says you wait, just one. Doesn't matter how-- so trivial. We've had production stop because of carpet in the trunk. We've had production stopbecause of a USB cable. At one point, for Model S, the -- we literally raided every electronics storein the Bay Area. For a few days there, nobody could buy a USB cable in the Bay Area because wewent and bought them all to put them in the car, literally.And there's like hundreds of stories like that. So anyway, that -- solving that -- those constraints anda logistics problem that makes World War II look trivial. I'm not kidding. Like the scale is insane.We're talking millions of cars, massive global supply chain, 50 countries, dozens of regulatoryregimes. It's insane. So yes.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you.

2021/4/26,"First question is from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureI'd love to get actually based on what you presented on the Battery Day. In the last 6, 7 months, Iwant -- I was wondering how much progress you've made on that front, ï¬?rst, in terms of processdevelopment. So how are things coming together on your pilot line? Are you getting to the kind ofproduction throughput you were aiming for?And second and actually on your production ramp. So I was wondering in which sites you'reramping production capacity for the 4680 cell and where you stand on ramping up that capacity aswell. And I have a quick follow-up on energy as well if that's possible.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaWell, so we have the -- and Drew can add to this. But we have the -- a small sort of pilot plant,which is still big by normal standards, expected to have like a 10-gigawatt hour per year capabilityin Fremont, California. And we made quite a few cells. We're not quite yet at the point where wethink the cells are reliable enough to be shipped in cars, but we're getting close to that point. Andthen we've already ordered most of the equipment for battery production in Berlin and then much ofit for Austin as well. So we really don't ï¬?ick the nitty-gritty elements. But overall, I think we stillfeel quite optimistic about this achieving volume production of the 4680 next year. What do youthink?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, thanks. Just one thing I would add is there's been a lot of questions about yields. Actually, Inoticed people asking about that. The yield progress has been really strong every day, and we werereally still in commissioning phase. We were really still in commissioning phase with most of thetools to the point where we're conï¬?dent that the yield trajectory aligns with our internal costprojections. We did talk about yield also at Battery Day, which is one of the reasons why it's usefulto check in on that. It takes a while, as Elon just mentioned, to go from prototype to production.And it's not just parts. It's processes, it's equipment. But as we've matured the process equipment,we've gotten to where we need to be on the yield side.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc.","Elon R.

2021/4/26,"- Technoking of TeslaYes. And basically, this is just a guess because we don't know for sure, but it appears as thoughwe're about 12 -- probably not more than 18 months away from volume production of the 4680.Now at the same time, we are actually trying to have our cell supply of partners ramp up theirsupply as much as possible. So this is not something that is to the exclusion of suppliers. It is inconjunction with suppliers. So we want to be super clear about that. This is not about replacingsuppliers. It is about supplementing the suppliers.So -- and we have a very strong partnership with CATL, with Panasonic and LG.

Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of CoinYes. We're seeing a lot of...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaWe're aiming for comparable margins in storage as in vehicle. But it is important to bear in mindthat vehicle is more mature than the storage. So -- we're already are at margins with the Powerwall.But some additional work is needed for the Megapack to achieve good margins. Yes, Drew, what doyou think?Andrew D.

It sounds like some of this is aboutto roll out next month. I'm not sure if that's the subscription model, but maybe you could just spenda little time talking about how impactful you expect that to be.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaSo go ahead, guys.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of CoinYes, we're working on getting FSD subscription out. There's a couple of internal technicaldependencies, but from a business model perspective, that's aligned, and we're hoping to roll thatout soon. The key thing that I say here, there's a lot of potential for recurring revenue based on FSDsubscription. If you look at the size of our ï¬?eet and you look at the number of customers who didnot purchase FSD upfront or on a lease and maybe want to experiment with FSD, this is a greatoption for them.One of the things we'll need to keep an eye on is a potential transition from cash purchases of FSDsubscription over to -- or cash purchases of FSD who may move over to FSD subscription. And sothere could be a period of time in which cash reduces in the near term and then as the portfolio ofsubscription customers builds up, then that becomes a pretty strong business for us over time. Butwe're hoping to get this launched pretty soon and see what the response is to it.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystOkay. Great. And I was hoping, Zach, maybe you can just talk a little bit about OpEx. There was anoticeable increase, even excluding SBC.

On the R&D side, what we're seeing, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, is kind of aconvergence of a series of programs that are happening. And our R&D OpEx spend kind ofcorrelates to where we are in the product life cycle on different programs.

2021/4/26,"And so we expect that to decrease over time, but it was high in Q1 for a lot of the reasonsthat Elon had mentioned.We're also getting very heavy into 4680 development that Drew and team are working on and theassociated structural battery pack that goes along with that.

And spend along in those areas should continue over time as we continue towork through the development cycle of those.And then I also mentioned Elon talked a bit about Dojo and the potential there. So from neural netinvestments and custom silicon investments, these continue to be areas that we spend on and makeinvestments in.On the SG&A side, the business is pivoting very quickly to be global. And China is ramping quitequickly.

2021/4/26,"From Dan Levy from Cr???©dit Suisse.Dan Meir Levy - Cr??©dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystTwo questions. One is on COGS. I think we've gotten from Battery Day a pretty good feel about thepotential for COGS reduction related to powertrain. But I'd like to get a sense of the path toreducing COGS, ex powertrain, as you'd still need a meaningful reduction on that front to make themath work on a $25,000 vehicle. So what levers do you have to reducing your cost, ex powertrain?Is it just more scale, better supplier pricing? Or is it just based on ongoing cost reduction?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of TeslaI mean I think all of the above.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, I mean on the vehicle side, there's plenty of opportunity as well. Obviously, building a car likea Model S lot is quite complex and has various moving parts. Model 3 and Model Y were steps ofimprovement in that. But when you look at some of the other advancements that we're including inthe Model Y , factories into Austin and Berlin, we've reduced the body count by as much as 60%,and the park cost money. So we continue to ï¬?nd optimizations there as well as we get theeconomies of scale when we start to talk about the volumes we're considering worldwide with 4factories building the same vehicle. So both of those things on the vehicle side will improve ourCOGS as well, and powertrain continues to be integrated into that.Dan Meir Levy - Cr??©dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystGreat. And then just related. As you see Berlin and Austin ramp, I'd like to just get a sense on thecomparison of Fremont versus the new capacity.

2021/7/26,"But before we jump into Q&A, Elon hassome opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSure. So to recap, Q2 2021 was a record quarter on many levels. We achieved record production,deliveries and surpassed over $1 billion in GAAP net income for the ï¬?rst time in Tesla history. I'dreally like to congratulate everyone at Tesla for an amazing job. This is really an incrediblemilestone.It also seems that public sentiment towards EVs is at an inï¬?ection point; and at this point, I thinkalmost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward. Regarding supply chain,while we're making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious. Forthe rest of this year, our growth rates will be determined by the slowest part in our supply chain,which is there's a wide range of chips that are, at various times, the slowest parts in the supplychain.I mean it's worth noting that if we had -- everything else, if we had vast numbers of vehiclesthemselves, we would not be able to make them -- if everything, except the chips, we wouldn't beable to make them. The chip supply is fundamentally the governing factor on our output. It isdifï¬?cult for us to see how long this will last because we don't have -- this is out of our controlessentially. It does seem like it's getting better, but it's hard to predict.So in fact, even achieving the output that we did achieve was only due to an immense effort frompeople within Tesla. We were able to substitute alternative chips and then write the ï¬?rmware in amatter of weeks. It's not just a matter of swapping out a chip. You also have to rewrite the software.So it was an incredibly intense effort of ï¬?nding new chips, writing new ï¬?rmware, integrating with the vehicle and testing in order to maintain production.And I'd also like to thank our suppliers who worked with us. And there have been many calls atmidnight, 1 a.m., just with suppliers but -- in resolving a lot of the shortages. So thanks very muchto our suppliers.Let's see. In terms of FSD subscription, we were able to launch full self-driving subscription lastmonth. And we expect it to build slowly and then -- but then gather a lot of momentum over time.Obviously, we need to have the full-self driving build widely available for it really to take off at ahigh rate and make a lot of progress there.","Q2 2021 was a record quarter on many levels.

2021/7/26,"So yes, I think FSD subscription will be a signiï¬?cantfactor probably next year.With regard to Giga Texas and Giga Berlin, we're actually doing this earnings call from Giga Texas,so we're in the factory right now doing this earnings call.

So it's really great work by the GigaTexas team. And then also great work in Berlin, Brandenburg with the team there.So we expect to be producing the sort of new design of the Model Y in both factories in limitedproduction later this year. It's always like it's not -- it's hard to sort of explain to people who havenot been through the agony of a manufacturing ramp. Like why can't you just turn it on and make5,000 a week? This is -- it is so hard to do manufacturing. It is so hard to do production. At grossapproximation, there are 10,000 unique parts and processes that have to work. And the greatergrowth of production goes as fast as the least lucky and dumbest of those 10,000 things. And abunch of them are not even in our control, so it's like -- it's insanely difï¬?cult.I'm fond of saying that prototypes are easy and production is hard. And arguably, the reallyremarkable thing that Tesla's done is not to make an electric car or to be a car start-up because therehave been hundreds of car start-ups in the United States and outside United States. So the thingthat's remarkable is that Tesla didn't go bankrupt in reaching volume production. That's the amazingpart because everyone else did, because they all got the prototype before the idea was the hard partand it is not. It is trivial by comparison with actual production.So it's always worth noting that of all the American car companies, there are only 2 that have notgone bankrupt and that is Ford and Tesla. So the seeds of defeat are sown on the day of victory, andwe must be careful that we do not do that. So often, if you look at history, so often, the seeds ofdefeat are sown on the day of victory. We will endeavor not to make that the case of Tesla.So let's see, the model lines in Texas -- and mainly in Texas and Berlin will be -- will look verymuch like the Model Ys we currently make, but there are substantial improvements in the difï¬?cultyof manufacturing.","FSD subscription will be a signiï¬?cantfactor probably next year.

2021/7/26,"So for example, the Model Y made here and in Berlin will have a cast front bodyand a cast rear body, whereas the one in California has a cast rear body but not a cast front body.We're also aiming to do a structural pack with 4680s cells, which is a mass reduction and a costreduction.But we're not counting on that as the only way to make things work. We have some backup planwith nonstructural -- with a nonstructural pack and 2170s essentially. So -- but at scale production,we obviously want to be using 4680s and a structural pack. From a physics standpoint, this is thebest architecture; and from an economic standpoint, it is the lowest cost way to go. So the lightest,lowest cost.But there's a lot of new technology there, so it is difï¬?cult to predict with precision when does itwork and when do you reach scale production. And Drew's going to talk a bit more about the 4680production. Yes.So we're all making great progress on the 4680 cells, but there is a tremendous amount ofinnovation that we're packing into that 4680 cell. And so it's not simply a sort of minorimprovement on state of the art. There are -- and we went through this on the Battery Cell Day --really dozens of -- half a dozen major improvements and dozens of small improvements. So I thinkit will be great, but it's difï¬?cult to say when the last of the technical challenges will be solved.So in conclusion, our team continues to make huge efforts to make our factories run at full speed,which is very difï¬?cult. We have had some factory shutdowns due to part shortages, and we hopethose will be relieved in the coming weeks and months. And we're making great progress on fullself-driving. Some of the progress is not easy to see because it is at a foundational software level,and so then it ends up being sort of a 2 steps forward, 1 step back situation. And -- but over time,you do 2 steps forward and 1 step back and keep going, you do move forward.So I'm highly conï¬?dent that the cars will be capable of full self-driving. If they have a full self-driving computer and the cameras, I'm conï¬?dent that they will be able to drive themselves with thesafety level substantially greater than that of the average cars.Once again, thanks to all of our employees who are making this a breakthrough year for Tesla andan incredible quarter.","We're also aiming to do a structural pack with 4680s cells, which is a mass reduction and a costreduction.

2021/7/26,"Thanks, guys.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And we have some follow-up remarks from Zachary Kirkhorn.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin, and thanks, Elon. Just to reiterate, Q2 was a great quarter for the Tesla teamwith strong improvements across the business. In particular, auto gross proï¬?t and margin, excludingcredit, increased substantially. This was primarily driven by better cost optimization across ourfactories, good execution against our cost reduction plans as well as increases in production anddelivery volumes.There was some beneï¬?t from pricing action mostly in North America. However, it was small in thecontext of the other contributors. Note that the Model S and X program was at a slight loss for thequarter due to the relatively low volume. And supply chain challenges, including expedites,continue to provide cost headwinds.Additionally, it's encouraging to see the progress made on proï¬?tability within our energy andservices and other businesses. While there's some beneï¬?t to looking at our progress quarter-over-quarter, I ï¬?nd it more helpful to look at progress over a slightly long-term horizon. Over the last 2years, our vehicle delivery volumes have more than doubled. This volume increase was madepossible by a steady decrease in ASPs of more than 10%, driven by our road map to increaseaffordability and shifting mix towards our more affordable vehicles. Yet over that same period oftime, our auto gross margin, excluding credit, has increased nearly 10 percentage points to ourhighest yet since the introduction of Model 3. This is only possible because our average cost pervehicle has reduced by more than the reduction in average price. This is a remarkable achievementin the context of the volume growth and ASP reduction, as mentioned, and a testament to the hardwork by the Tesla team.Additionally, OpEx as a percentage of revenue has declined and in particular, SG&A, representingthe work we've done to become more efï¬?cient as we scale the company while still making therequired R&D investments to support our future. As a result, our GAAP operating margins haverisen from negative to double digit in line with what we have guided. By managing our overheadcosts and driving higher volumes, our P&L is beneï¬?ting from the marginal proï¬?tability of eachincremental unit, or said differently, we are recognizing the beneï¬?ts of scale and improved ï¬?xedcost absorption.With strong operating cash ï¬?ows and cash balance, we are putting that cash to use. CapEx continuesto tick up, primarily driven by capacity investments in Austin, Berlin and Shanghai.","Q2 was a great quarter for the Tesla team with strong improvements across the business.

2021/7/26,"Additionally,each quarter, we are using our cash to retire legacy debt, which was taken on at a time when interestrates and company risks were much higher than in today's environment.As I've mentioned before, our 2021 volumes will skew towards the second half of the year as wepush for continued sequential increases in volume. Despite the great work so far managing theinstability of the supply chain, these challenges remain and are unfortunately increasing in painwith the higher volume. As we work through the uncertainty, we want to ensure we do our best tomanage customer wait times as well as the impact these interruptions have on our employees andcosts.And as Elon mentioned, volume growth will be determined by part availability as we have thefactory capacity ready and are in a strong demand position.

Thank youvery much.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRGreat. Thank you very much, Zach. And now let's go through the retail investor questions onsay.com.Questions and Answers:Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThe ï¬?rst question from Robert M. is Tesla's website still says Cybertruck production is expected tobegin in late 2021. Can Tesla share more details on the current status of the Cybertruck and conï¬?rmif production is still (technical difï¬?culty) Lars, do you want to...Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringSorry, we cut out there for a second. Yes, the Cybertruck is currently in its alpha stages. We ï¬?nishedthe basic engineering, architecture of the vehicle. With the Cybertruck, we're redeï¬?ning how thevehicle is being made. As Elon said, it carries much of the structural pack and large casting designsof the Model Y being built in Berlin and Austin. Obviously, those take priority over the Cybertruck,but we are moving into the beta phases of Cybertruck later this year, and we'll be looking to rampthat in production in Giga Texas after Model Y is up and going.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, just worth reemphasizing that the extraordinarily difï¬?cult -- extraordinary difï¬?culty of rampingproduction of large manufacturing items. The risk of being repetitive, it's actually easy to makeprototypes or sort of handle small volume production. But anything produced at high volume,which is really what's relevant here, is it's going to move as fast as the slowest of the, say, at roughorder of magnitude, 10,000 unique parts and processes.And so you can have 9,999, which is 1 is missing.","As I've mentioned before, our 2021 volumes will skew towards the second half of the year as wepush for continued sequential increases in volume.

Thank youvery much.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRGreat. And now let's go through the retail investor questions onsay.com. The first question is about the Cybertruck. Can Tesla share more details on the current status of the Cyberruck and conï¬?rmif production is still (technical difï¬?culty)",,
2021/7/26,"I mean we were missing -- for example, like abig struggle this quarter was the module that controls the airbags and the seatbelts. And obviously,you cannot ship a car without those. And that limited our production severely worldwide inShanghai and in Fremont. So it -- like it wouldn't have mattered if we had like 17 different carmodels because they won't need the airbag module, so it's irrelevant.So the -- in order for Cybertruck and Semi to scale to volume that's meaningful for customerdeliveries, we've got to solve the chip shortage or working with our suppliers and people just wantto say, ""Why don't you just build a chip fab?"" Okay, well, okay, that would take us, even movinglike lightning, 12 to 18 months. So it's not like you can just whip out a chip fab, just like, yes, I'lljust make a quick chip fab.So some of these things are -- yes, anyway. It is quite a trial dealing with all of the constraints ofscaling a large manufactured object. I think it may be the case that Tesla is scaling. It's -- I think wemight be the fastest in history ever for scaling a large manufactured object. I think maybe the ModelT would have been comparable back in the day, the Ford Model T. Probably, the Internet knows theanswer. But I think we may be scaling large manufactured object at the fastest rate in history. Or I'dlike to know who did it faster, so we can learn from them. So it's worth just noting that, and in thegrand scheme of things, it's not bad.So yes, so Cybertruck and Semi, actually both are heavy users of cell capacity. So we've got tomake sure we have the cell capacity for those 2 vehicles or it's kind of pointless. We can make asmall number of vehicles, but the effective cost if you make a small number of vehicles is the same.Like they literally cost like $1 million a piece or more. There's a reason why you do things atvolume production, which is to get the economies of scale that get us down.So we are looking at a pretty massive increase in cell availability next year, but it's not like inJanuary 1. It comes through -- it ramps up through the course of next year. But even without Tesla --Tesla's (technical difï¬?culty) Hello? Okay. Even without Tesla cell production, we believe oursuppliers will be able to deliver about twice as much cell output in next year as this year.","Cybertruck and Semi, actually both are heavy users of cell capacity.

2021/7/26,"And Drew,do you want to talk more about that?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, given concerns over cells bottlenecking growth, our target is to grow cell supply ahead of the50% year-on-year growth targets of the vehicle business and also enable increased energy storagedeployments. So yes, our cell suppliers are tracking to double their production in 2022.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. It's worth thing like if you have a target of a certain number, that doesn't mean it happens likeas sure as night follows day. It's a target. So if there is some calamity in the world that it drops thesupply chain, then it will be less. But the contracts that we have with cell suppliers quote roughly adoubling of cell supply to Tesla in 2022.And we have to juggle these exponential -- there's a whole bunch of exponential graphs sort ofoverlay on top of each other, and small changes in where you are on the X axis of time can quitesubstantially change the area under the curve. So what we're thinking of doing is like depending on-- it's basically overshooting on cell supply for vehicles, and then as we have, say, excess cellsupply in 1 month or another, then routing that cell output to the Megapack and Powerwall. Oh bythe -- if we're -- prior to [taking] vehicle production, if there's a shortage of cell output, for somereason, then we will throttle down Megapack and Powerwall production. So it will be something'sgot to give basically.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringOr if there's a disruption to vehicle production, you have an outlet for the cell capacity.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. There's a tremendous amount of inertia in the supply chain. So if we say to a supplierwe want you to double cell output, well, even doing that in a year is very difï¬?cult. And then thatsystem has a tremendous amount of momentum. It is like a [plateau] of supertankers. It's insane.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSpeaking of which, from a raw materials perspective, we also have long-term contracts to secureour supply chain to also enable its growth. So we're not just looking at the suppliers but upstreamfrom there.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes.Andrew D.","Elon R.

2021/7/26,"Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringWhich has more ï¬?ow to it.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. As mentioned, things will move as fast as the slowest part of the entire supply chain,which goes all the way back to raw materials, lithium and nickel and that kind of thing. And there'ssometimes perception that Tesla uses a lot of cobalt, but we actually don't. Apple uses, I think,almost 100% cobalt in their batteries in cellphones, laptops. But Tesla uses no cobalt in the ironphosphate packs and almost none in the nickel-based chemistries. So on a weighted average basis,we might use 2% cobalt compared to the Apple's 100% cobalt.Anyway, so it's just -- it's really just not a fact. We expect to basically have 0 cobalt in the future. SoI do -- maybe with -- I think probably there is a long-term shift more in the direction of iron-basedlithium-ion cells over nickel. As the energy density of sort of iron ore or the iron phosphate -- mightas well just call it iron. The phosphate is taken for granted. But iron-based cells, lithium-ion cellsand nickel-based lithium-ion cells, I think probably we'll see a shift. My guess is probably to 2/3iron, 1/3 nickel or something on that order.And this is actually good because there's plenty of iron in the world. There's an insane amount ofiron. But nickel is -- there's much less nickel, and there's way less cobalt. So it is good for relievingthe long-term scaling to move to iron-based cells mostly. And I think long term, possibly all --there's a good chance that all stationary storage, that is Powerwall and Megapack, moves iron,which is most likely the case since you do not need to transport it and there's [less volume thatmatch] constraint for stationary storage. So then nickel would be for -- really for long-range roadtransport, ships and aircraft, that kind of thing.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. Let's go to the second question from retail, which is Elon has said that Tesla will beopening up the Supercharger network to other EVs later this year. Can you share some more detailson how this will be structured? Will this be at select brands? Or will they contribute to the growthof this network?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. We're currently thinking it's a real simple thing where you just download the Tesla app and yougo to a Supercharger, and you just indicate which stall you're in.","Elon R.

2021/7/26,"So you plug in your car even if it'snot Tesla, and then you just access the app and say turn on this stall that I'm in for how muchelectricity. And this should basically work with, I think, almost any manufacturer's cars.There will be a time constraint. So if the charge rate is super slow, then somebody will be chargedmore because the biggest constraint at the Superchargers is time, how occupied is the stall. Andwe'll also be smarter with how we charge for electricity at the Superchargers. So rush hour chargingwill be more expensive than off hours charging because there are times when the Superchargers areempty and times when they're jampacked. And so it makes sense to have some time-baseddiscrimination.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. We've been doing that, and it's been working and people respond. It helps with utilization.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. So yes, I think we're -- in Europe and China and most parts of the world, it's the sameconnector for everyone. So this is a fairly easy thing to do, develop our own connector, which, inmy opinion, is actually the best connector. It's small and light, looks good, so standard. So wedeveloped our own connector, which in my opinion, is actually the best connector. It's small andlight, looks good.So an adapter is needed to work for EVs in North America. But people could buy this adapter, andwe anticipate having it available at the Superchargers as well if people don't sort of steal them orsomething.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringWe have a good solution for that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorOkay. So -- but that is -- that's a constraint on North America thing. That's basically a vestige ofhistory. But I think we do want to emphasize that it is -- our goal is to support the advent ofsustainable energy. It is not to create a walled garden and use that to bludgeon our competitors,which is sometimes used by some companies.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringI think it's also important to comment that increasing the utilization of the network actually reducesour costs, which allows us to lower charging prices for all customers, makes the network moreproï¬?table, allows us to grow the network faster.","Elon R.

2021/7/26,"So that's a good thing there. And no matter what,we're going to continue to aggressively expand the network capacity, increasing charging speeds,improving the trip planning tools to protect against site congestion using dynamic pricing, as Elonmentioned, and just continuing to focus on minimum wait time for all customers.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Obviously, in order for this to be -- for the Supercharger to be useful to other powercompanies, Lars, we need to grow the network faster than we're growing vehicle output, which isnot easy. We're growing vehicle output at a hell of a rate. So Superchargers need to grow faster thanvehicle output, so this is a lot of work for the Supercharger team. But it is only useful in the grandscheme of things. It's only useful to the public if we're able to grow faster than Tesla vehicle output.So that is our goal.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And the third question is Elon said 4680 cells aren't reliable enough forvehicles. Is this referring to cycle life degradation or something else? Please update us on progressof 4680s? And what still needs to be done to make them reliable enough for vehicles?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, really, this is about -- we'll deï¬?nitely make the 4680 reliable enough for vehicles. Andwe, I think, are at the point where, in limited volume, it is reliable enough for vehicles. The -- again,going back to like limited production is easier. Prototype production is easy, but high-volumeproduction is hard. There are a number of challenges in transitioning from small-scale production toa large-volume production.And not to get too much into the weeds of things, but right now, we have a challenge with basicallythe, what's called calendaring or basically squashing the cathode material to a particular height. Soit just goes through these welders and get squashed like pizza dough basically and -- but very hardpizza dough. And the -- it's causing -- it's denting the calendar rolls. This is not something thathappened when the calendar rolls were smaller, but it is happening when the calendar rolls arebigger. So just like -- we're like, okay, weren't expecting that.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. It's not a like science problem. It's an engineering problem. It's not a question of if.","Elon R.

And on the reliability side, as Elon mentioned, we have successfully validated performanceand the lifetime durability of the 4680 cells produced for Kato.

Can Elon do aninterview with one of our YouTube channels once or twice a year? I would nominate Dave Lee onInvesting or Rob Mauer's Tesla Daily channels as ï¬?rst possible candidates.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I guess I'll do an interview. I mean, just bear in mind, like if I'm doing interviews, then I can'tdo actual other work. So it's not -- I only have so much time in the day, so -- but yes, I'll do one. Iwon't do it annually, but I'll do it once.I think also like this is the, I wouldn't say the last time I'll do earnings calls, but this is the -- I willno longer be defaults during earnings calls.

Thank you. Now let's go to institutional questions. The ï¬?rst one -- and we covered a lot ofthis already. Can you please update us on time lines for the start of production of Berlin and AustinModel Y , Cybertruck and the Semi? Do you expect the ramp of Cybertruck to be as difï¬?cult as it isa new process?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think Cybertruck ramp will be difï¬?cult because it's such a new architecture. I mean it's going to bea great product. It might, I think, be our best product ever. But it -- there's a lot of fundamentallynew design ideas on Cybertruck. Nobody's ever really made a car like this before, a vehicle like thisbefore. So there'll probably be challenges because there's so much unexplored territory. Yes.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. I think question 2 and question 3, we can skip given we have already addressed this. I'llgo to question 4. In 5 years' time, how much faster or better could you be at manufacturing capacityexpansion using cut and paste?

2021/7/26,"Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, like I said, I think we might be the fastest growing company in history for any largemanufactured items. So those who have not actually been involved in the manufacturing ramp-upjust have no idea how painful and difï¬?cult it is. It's like you got to eat a lot of glass, and for [auto]manufacturing ramp, it's hard.Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringYes. I mean I think if you look at the expansion we've done in Shanghai, that factory was built inless in a year and ramped in 5 to 6 months to full volume. When you...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think it's longer than that. It's longer than that, about a year.Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringAnd when you consider cut and paste, we've repeated that in Fremont and whatever. But now withBerlin and Austin, we have new factories and new designs. And so there's always challenges, asyou said, Elon, with new designs in ramping that. But I think having teams in 3 locations or 3continents will deï¬?nitely expand our ability and our capacity to grow more lines rather than justhaving the 1 factory in Fremont that we had 1.5 years ago.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. So I mean, for Shanghai, incredible team both the factory in 11 months, but it took longer thanbuilding the factory because it took longer than that to actually reach volume production -- a high-volume production, so took about a year. So when you put a factory in a new geography, in orderfor that factory to be efï¬?cient, you have to localize the supply chain. So there's no such thing as cutand paste. It does not exist.And it obviously be insane to do vehicle production in Europe but send vast numbers of parts fromNorth America.

Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior AnalystCan you speak to the attach rates for FSD so far and what you're targeting in terms of thesubscription levels?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. It's not worth commenting on right now. It's not meaningful. We really need full self-driving, atleast the beta, to be widely available, so anyone who wants it can get it. Otherwise, it'd be pointlessto read anything into where things are right now. So, yes.Colin William Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division - MD & Senior AnalystOkay. And then just the follow-up there is about the cadence of the regulatory environment keepingup with the technology. Are you seeing meaningful evolution in terms of the regulators reallyunderstanding the technology and beginning to set some standards here sometime in the near term?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorAt least in the U.S., we don't see regulation as a fundamental limiter. We've got -- we're obviouslygoing to make the work and then demonstrate that the reliability is signiï¬?cantly in excess of theaverage human driver for it to be allowed -- for people to be able to use it without paying attentionto the road.But I think we have a massive ï¬?eet, so it will be, I think, straightforward to make the argument onstatistical grounds just based on the number of interventions or especially interventions that wouldresult in a crash. At scale, we think we'll have [billions] of miles of travel to be able to show that itis the safety of the car with autopilot on is 100% or 200% or more safer than the average humandriver. At that point, I think it would be unconscionable to -- not to allow autopilot because the carjust comes way less safe.It will be sort of like if you take the elevator analogy. Back in the day, you used to have elevatoroperators with like a big sort of switch that operates the elevator and moves between ï¬?oors. Butthey get tired or maybe drunk or something or distracted, and every time and again, somebodywould be kind of sheared in half between ï¬?oors. That's kind of the situation we have with cars.Autonomy will become so safe that it will be unsafe to manually operate the car, relativelyspeaking.And today, obviously, we just get in an elevator.","Elon R.

2021/7/26,"Next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with New Street Research.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureI have another question actually on batteries but on a slightly different angle. I was wondering howyou're looking at your sourcing strategy for the 4680. You've talked a lot about all the work you'redoing to develop your in-house production. But what about asking other battery manufacturers todo 4680 cells with their own technology, maybe less innovation than what you guys are lining upinternally? And I was wondering if the ï¬?rst 4680 cells that we'll see on the road will deï¬?nitely comefrom Tesla's own manufacturing lines or whether they could be coming actually from outsidesuppliers as well. And I have a quick follow-up.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. We are, in fact, working with our existing suppliers to produce 4680 format cells. And this isjust a guess right now, but I see us sort of like consolidating around 4680 nickel-based structuralpack and for long-range vehicles. And then not necessarily a 4680 format but some other format foriron-based cells. And so we -- right now, we kind of have the Baskin-Robbins of batteries situationwith us. We have so many formats and so many chemistries that it's like we've got like 36 ï¬?avors ofbattery this way.This is just -- this results in an engineering drag coefï¬?cient where each variant of cell chemistry andformat requires a certain amount of engineering to maintain it and troubleshoot, and this inhibits ourforward progress. So it is going to be important to consolidate to just maybe ideally 2 form factors,maybe 3 but ideally 2 and then just 1 nickel chemistry and 1 iron chemistry and -- so we don't haveto troubleshoot so many different variants.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. And towards that end, we are engaging with the suppliers that we've had good partnershipswith on 4680 designs to enable that simpliï¬?cation, and so far, so good. They're working on --they're bringing their core competencies to bear on that. We're not mandating like what's going oninside, but it's been a good collaboration.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. And we do expect to see signiï¬?cant increases in supply from our existing suppliers in additionto the cells that Tesla's making. So it's both. Sometimes I get questions from our cell suppliers oflike are we just going to make all the cells ourselves and we're like no.","Elon R.

2021/7/26,"Please make as many as youpossibly can and supply them to us. We have a signiï¬?cant unmet demand in stationary storage.Megapack is basically sold out until the end of next year, I believe. We have a massive backlog inPowerwall demand. The demand of Powerwall versus production is an insane mismatch. Now partof that problem is also the semiconductor issue. So we use a lot of the same chips in the Powerwallas you do in a car. So it's like which one do you want to make? Cars or Powerwalls? So we need tomake cars, so therefore, Powerwall production has been reduced.But as that semiconductor shortage is alleviated, then we can massively ramp up Powerwallproduction. I think we have a chance of hitting an annualized rate of 1 million units of Powerwallnext year maybe towards -- on the order of 20,000 a week but again, dependent on cell supply andsemiconductors.But in terms of demand, I think there's probably demand for in excess of 1 million Powerwalls peryear and actually -- and just a vast amount of Megapacks for utilities. As the world transitions to asustainable energy production, solar and wind are intermittent and, by their nature, really needbattery packs in order to provide a steady ï¬?ow of electricity. And when you look at all of theutilities in the world, this is a vast amount of batteries that are needed.

I'd be curious to understand how it affectedbehavior and if you saw like a massive uptake in the service. And I'm not thinking about peoplelooking at it as an FSD but more to try the most advanced version of autopilot and to try it. So inthe ï¬?rst days, you've announced the pricing.

Our Q3 results wereannounced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as thiswebcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ï¬?lings with the SEC.

We're continuing to make great progress as a company, setting new records oneach of the most important ï¬?nancial metrics for Q3. Overall, we delivered just over 240,000 cars,20% higher than last quarter and 70% higher than the same quarter last year. We were also able toachieve an annualized production run rate of over 1 million cars towards the end of the quarter.The increase in production rate has primarily been driven by further ramping of the Model Y at ourShanghai factory. Additionally, we have made great progress increasing production volumes ofModel S and have recently started the ramp and deliveries of Model X. It will take a bit more timeto get this program back to prior volumes, but based on demand, we are targeting to exceedhistorical production levels. We have also completed the transition of our Shanghai factory as ourmain export hub. This has enabled us to supply more vehicles to the North America market and tointroduce Model Y to Europe.Due to part shortages and logistics variability, we have not been able to run our factories at fullcapacity. It's important to note that while we have roughly doubled deliveries year-to-date, this hasbeen exceptionally difï¬?cult to achieve. I want to thank our supply chain team for their incrediblework and our production teams for showing impressive ï¬?exibility as we make adjustments real-time. This team's expertise in the chip industry across all tiers has made a huge difference whenmanaging through these challenges. Additionally, we never reduced our production forecast withour suppliers as we're adding capacity as quickly as possible. I also want to thank our suppliers fortheir dedication and partnership to Tesla.Despite these increases in production and generally higher prices, our backlogs are continuing togrow and average customer wait times are extending.","Our Q3 results wereannounced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.

Additionally,we have made good progress on the in-house battery manufacturing program, and we're excited tohave expanded the full self-driving beta program to more customers.Financially, our auto gross margins reached 30.5% on a GAAP basis and just under 29% excludingregulatory credits, which is our strongest yet. This beneï¬?t primarily comes from higher volumesparticularly out of the Shanghai factory, increased mix of the Model Y as we -- and we have madegood progress increasing Model S volumes. The Model S has now returned to positive grossmargin, and we expect this to increase with higher production and the ramp of Model X.As was the case in Q2, there was some net beneï¬?t from pricing actions. However, this remainssmall in the context of other contributors. Please keep in mind that given backlog, it will take timefor the impact of recent changes to ï¬?ow through our ï¬?nancials. Note that we are also not yetrecognizing additional revenue from the FSD beta program. Supply chain challenges, includingexpedites, continue to provide cost headwinds as was also the case with FX this quarter. While weare seeing an impact from the rise in commodity and labor costs, we have also been adjustingpricing, which should help to compensate.Overall, as I mentioned in our last call, our P&L continues to beneï¬?t from the marginal proï¬?tabilityof each incremental unit with higher ï¬?xed cost absorption. As a result of the great progress onmargins, volume and appropriate management of overhead costs, we were able to achieve anoperating margin of just under 15%, exceeding the long-term guidance we've laid out previously.On cash, we generated record operating cash ï¬?ows of $3.1 billion and continue to invest heavily inthe build-out of manufacturing, supercharging and service capacity. We also continue to retire high-interest-rate debt, including the early settlement of our 2025 senior notes of $1.8 billion during thequarter.As we look forward, we are clearly quite a bit ahead of the pacing required to achieve our targetannual growth rate of 50% this year. Q4 production will depend heavily on availability of parts, butwe are driving for continued growth. We are also nearing assembly of our ï¬?rst production cars inAustin and Berlin.","Financially, our auto gross margins reached 30.5% on a GAAP basis and just under 29% excludingregulatory credits, which is our strongest yet.

Thanks, Martin. Early next year, from a non-cell perspective, structural, battery, crash, rangeand reliability testing are on track to be complete this quarter. Testing is -- to date has gone well,and the Fremont manufacturing line is on track to support. However, similar to what Zach saidbefore, this is a new architecture and unknown unknowns may exist still. Our top priority isensuring quality in what we deliver.

What are the biggest hurdles from now untilthen?Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringThanks, Martin. Yes. We're working on a strategy to increase our production rates as quickly aspossible. I think Zach spoke to that well. And we're doing this while trying to add the least amountof incremental complexity to the business. We don't want to add any new vehicles to our lineupwhen we're generally in a cell-constrained world. While there is still more runway to grow theseexisting products, we are focused on Model Y expansion in Austin, Berlin, ramping S and X furtherin Fremont to restore to past levels while also growing 3 and Y production in Fremont andShanghai. As we've mentioned before, after Model Y in Austin, our next product launch will beCybertruck. And that timing, of course, depends on increasing cell capacity both from our suppliersand through our in-house cell as well as many other headwinds we face in the supply chain andcompleting our currently full plate of products on the table.","Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringThanks, Martin.

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAt this point, it's not so much about how much data can we collect but how quickly can we processthe data we've collected. This is where Dojo comes in, as we mentioned on AI Day. Withsubstantially faster training computer in Dojo, we will be able to iterate more often than we do nowif, for instance, say, the training and that takes 1 day instead of 1 week makes a huge difference inour ability to push out more updates. But realistically, there's a whole lot more that comes into playwhen iterating software updates. The whole infrastructure from top to bottom, including testing andvalidation, needs to be set up for faster iteration. So daily updates are not really realistic for now.","With FSD beta training data sets set to explodeexponentially as software is released to a wider and wider audience, are there any early takeaways with regards to how quickly versions can iterate and be pushed out from biweekly to weekly oreven daily?Andrew D.

As we've mentioned before, we've seen record growth of both Model 3 andModel Y segments, where Model 3 is currently the best-selling luxury sedan worldwide. And as wementioned at our shareholders' meeting, Model Y is poised to be the best-selling vehicle in theworld. Tesla continues to break molds in these vehicle segments, and we hope to do so with eachnew product. As we've said publicly, we'll eventually expand the vehicle lineup to get to largervolumes, and we believe that we will need to be in all major segments across small and midsize,large sedans, SUVs and trucks to do so, along with, of course, the massive space of robotaxi.","The best-selling cars in the world today only sell slightly over 1 million units.

2021/10/20,"The next question from a retail shareholder is, what is Tesla's goal forvehicle production capacity for the 4 current factories, Fremont, Shanghai, Austin and Berlin, by2024?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. Our goal as a company here is to grow on an average pace of 50% per year.And so you can extrapolate that out. There may be some periods of time in which we're well aheadof that. There could be some periods of time, despite best efforts, where we're slightly lower thanthat. But that remains the long-term goal of the company.In Fremont, we're continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible there. Over the last 12months, we've done about 430,000 cars of production. And based upon everything that we know inthe factory, where the bottlenecks are, what the potential is, we're targeting to increase that another50%. I think that will be a difï¬?cult goal but that's the goal that the internal team has, and they'regoing to continue to push on that.As we look towards Shanghai, we're continuing to push the boundaries there and we continue toramp production there as well, so most recently the ramp-up of the Model Y , which was our biggestcontributor of volume in Q3. We'll continue to ramp that factory. And our plans there with time areto keep growing the capacity in that factory.Austin and Berlin are interesting factories because our ï¬?rst iterations of capacity there are on ModelY , but we've intentionally set these factories in locations in which they have a quite signiï¬?cantamount of land and ability to expand. And so we'll take Model Y at these factories. We're trying toget to 5,000 cars a week as soon as we can. And then we'll continue to push beyond that, potentiallyeven getting to 10,000 cars per week at those factories. And then we'll add Cybertruck here inAustin and continue to grow from there.So our goal is to get to millions of cars per year over the next couple of years and then ultimately, inthe long term, be able to achieve 20 million cars per year. We're going to grow as quickly as isfeasibly possible with an eye towards a 50% annual growth rate.","Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes.

2021/10/20,"Great.  The next question is, what is your view on the tightening regulatoryenvironment for FSD, the investigation and broad data request by NHTSA? Some of the recentnominees to NHTSA have been publicly critical of FSD, including engaging with short sellersonline. How will you manage this environment?Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringThanks, Martin. Yes. As we have been for years, we always engage with NHTSA and otherworldwide regulatory bodies to share our knowledge and to work with them on our approaches onboth active and passive safety. There are ongoing regulatory inquiries taking place all the time andespecially on the subjects like FSD that are at the cutting edge of technology development. Duringthese investigations, my team, myself are always cooperative as much as possible. We expect andembrace the scrutiny of these products and know that the truth about their performance and theinnovations our products have will ultimately be all that matters.In the end and as I've said on previous calls, we take safety as a top priority in all our designs. Thisis because our primary motivation is from -- coming from a team of incredible engineers designingsoftware and hardware that saves lives and prevents injuries. In doing so, we'll continue to betransparent to the public on how our technology is both developing from an Autopilot safety data,the latest of which we just shared in the shareholder update, and you can also see and review a widevariety of customer post FSD videos on social media.

2021/10/20,"Great.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOJust to add to that, I mean as Lars said, safety is extremely important for Tesla. It's the right thing todo. And if you look at various independent testing and regulatory testing of our products, you cansee the work of incredibly talented engineers in the results of those tests. And our goal indeveloping safety-oriented software around the car is to continue to go beyond what the hardware isable to provide. If you can prevent a crash from happening, that's the safest way to manage this.And I think at a macro level here, what we're seeing -- and this is entirely understandable andexpected, is that the automotive industry is going through a transition from the traditional car as weknow it to more of a computer, software-oriented, sensor suites around them that can manage thingsbeyond just what the driver manages. And regulatory bodies are -- understandably so, are interestedin understanding how to regulate in this environment, and NHTSA is no exception to that. So asLars mentioned here, I think this is a great thing.

2021/10/20,"The next question is, service remains an issue with appointments availableweeks or even months out. Likewise, Supercharger wait times have become untenable at somelocations. What concrete steps is Tesla taking to improve the customer experience in these 2 keyareas?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. I'll take the service part of this question. Drew, you can take the supercharging part. We haveseen an increase in service wait times throughout the summer. And there's a couple of things thathave contributed to that based upon the information that we have. The ï¬?rst is that -- and I think thisis kind of not -- this is not unique to us, is that the return to some sense of normalcy in a post-pandemic world has happened, I think, more quickly than most people expected. And what we'reseeing here is that the number of miles that people are driving has increased. There may have beensome demand for service during 2020 or in the early parts of 2021 that customers put off, and sothere's a bit of a catch-up that's occurring. That has increased demand for service. At the same time,in the macro environment here, logistics, moving parts, sourcing parts has become increasinglymore difï¬?cult, which is a well-known issue in the world right now, as well as challenges in the labormarket.And so this kind of the simultaneous increase in demand for service with the ability to supply thatservice has been impacted for the reasons I mentioned. And so we saw an uptick primarily inEurope and North America in service wait times over the course of the summer. And we've beenworking extremely hard since then to address this, and we've seen our wait times come down. Sothis is not the case in every location, but if you think about it from regional average perspective, weare seeing improvements there.We remain super-focused on adding locations. And so over the last year, we've grown our physicalfootprint of service centers by 35%. We've grown our footprint of mobile repair by over 40%. We'realso adding stafï¬?ng as quickly as we can in the areas that are most impacted by the imbalance ofsupply and demand for service.But I think the most important part about all of this is -- and we've said this on calls before, wherethe best service is no service. And so we have been incredibly focused as a company both on theinitial quality of our vehicles and reliability of our vehicles.","Service remains an issue with appointments availableweeks or even months out.

If you haven't experienced our latest iteration ofbattery packs that can handle fast charge rates in combination with our 250-kilowatt chargingstations, it's pretty incredible. And this is a really important component to supercharging capacitybecause the faster you can charge, the more charge sessions that you can have on an individual post,the better the customer experience is as you're going on a long-term journey because yoursupercharging times are lower.

2021/10/20,"Great, thank you. And maybe last question from shareholders is, how does FSD take rate -- how hasFSD take rate changed since the introduction of monthly subscription? Are there any plans toincrease FSD pricing as wider release becomes imminent?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOI'll take the second part of the question ï¬?rst. We won't be providing any kind of forward-lookingcommentary on our pricing strategy or what may happen here over the near term. With respect tothe ï¬?rst part of the question, it has been an interesting thing for us to unpack within the company. Imean what I'll say just as a general statement before I make a couple of speciï¬?c comments is thatthe things that we learn on FSD subscription today are not necessarily all that relevant. This isreally more of a platform for when FSD beta goes into wide release and the features andfunctionality become more accessible to more customers.The second thing that I'll note is that if you look at the pricing, the monthly pricing of FSDsubscription, and then you compare that to the cost of either rolling FSD option into your lease oryour loan, on a monthly basis, the most economical way for a customer to enjoy the features of fullself-driving is through purchasing it upfront and rolling it through their ï¬?nancing. And as a result ofthat, what we've seen in the data is not -- we're unable to detect a change in the upfront take rate ofFSD when people purchase cars. We have seen quite a bit of activity of folks curious to experiencewhat the software has to offer and subscribing to it and enjoying it through that route. But again, asI said at the beginning, I think what we've seen so far on FSD subscription is not terribly relevant.We'll see how that plays out in the future as we continue to release more features.","Zachary J.

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureI would have panicked. Anyway, let me ask you my question. Actually, I'm very intrigued by whatyou guys are doing on the insurance front. And so you have now in the market in Texas aninsurance product for which the premium varies as a function of the safety score of the driver. Andso I'd love to hear you about that. You must have some initial data points about market reaction.What's the update?And from there, can you tell us about how you think you're going to distribute that? Is that going togo through your installed base very easily? Or is it going to be like a heavy marketing push? Andthen maybe tell us about your expansion plans. What are the next geographies? What's the timing?How fast is that business line likely to grow in the next few years?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thank you, Pierre. I'm extremely passionate about our insurance product. We have a terriï¬?cteam here at Tesla of folks who have been spending a lot of time developing this and probablylistening to the call. So we're pretty excited so far, Pierre.So I mean at the highest level here, we entered the insurance market kind of unintentionally, Iwould say. Our customers were coming to us, complaining that the price of traditional insurancewas too high and it was reducing the affordability of a Tesla. And part of our journey here at Teslais we want as many people as possible to be able to afford our products. That's extremely importantto achieving the mission of the company. And if you look at the price of insurance as a percentageof what somebody's monthly payment is, it's quite high. And we spend extreme amounts of effort inmanufacturing to take $5 of BOM cost out here or $10 out somewhere else. If we can get $5, $10,$20, $30 out on a monthly payment, you can calculate what that means in terms of reduction of theprice of the car if you ï¬?nance it, and the leverage of improving insurance cost is huge in terms ofaffordability.And so that's kind of the context by which we stepped into this. As we started to do more research,essentially, the tools by which the insurance is traditionally calculated are optimized based upon theexisting data, but the existing data is limited.","Zachary J.

2021/10/20,"So they -- there's a focus on things like marital statusor age or other attributes like that. Accident history is a good one, et cetera. But what essentiallyhappens here is customers who are low risk and don't actually ï¬?le many claims end up overpayingon their insurance relative to their cost. That overpayment then goes to riskier customers who areessentially being subsidized. And as we looked at this and we looked at the data, we thought thisjust doesn't seem like it's fair.At Tesla, because our cars are connected, because they are essentially computers on wheels, there'senormous amounts of data that we have available to us to be able to assess the attributes of a driverwho's operating that car and whether those attributes correlate with safety because we do get asignal when a car has been in an accident. So we've been spending our time looking at hundreds ofdifferent variables and also looking at billions of miles of driving history. And we've been able to ï¬?ta model that is able to predict, with decent accuracy, the probability of collision over a period oftime.And the model is not perfect, right? The model is a function of the data that we have available. Thatdata set continues to grow. We continue to experiment with new variables, but we do have a modelthat works pretty well so far. And from that model, being able to predict frequency of collision, wecan then align that against the price curve. And we can have individualized pricing integrated intothe car, integrated into the app, integrated into that customer's experience with a feedback loop backto the customer on how they are driving after every drive, the attributes that they were successful onor unsuccessful on, in the tips of things that they can do to improve their safety. So that's whatwe've developed.We then included the safety score as part of the FSD beta enrollment program, where we havealmost 150,000 cars currently using a safety score. And I believe the latest data is over 100 millionmiles of driving. So we've been able to go back and analyze that data. And we've learned 2 thingscoming from that. The ï¬?rst is that the probability of collision for a customer using a safety scoreversus not is 30% lower. It's a pretty big difference. It means that the product is working andcustomers are responding to it. The second thing that we've looked at is what is the probability ofcollision based upon actual data as a function of a driver safety score.","At Tesla, because our cars are connected, because they are essentially computers on wheels, there'senormous amounts of data that we have available to us.

2021/10/20,"And that is aligning with ourmodels. Most notably, if you're in the top tier of safety compared to lower tiers, there's multiple Xdifference in probability of collision based upon actual data. So this is a very new and very excitingfrontier for us. I know that was long-winded, but I -- we spent a lot of time on this and we put a lotof thought into it.Speciï¬?cally with respect to the rollout, the insurance industry in the U.S. is intensely regulated andit's regulated on a state-by-state level. That means that we require regulatory approvals from eachindividual department of insurance at each individual state. Texas is the ï¬?rst state that we launchedin.

So Zach, as you noticed -- or as you noted, you hit low teens operating margins. That wasyour medium-term target. You're there now despite the number of challenges and not full utilizationin some of the plants. So how are you thinking about that target now? Does it allow you to eitherdrive price down further to unlock more demand, invest in other initiatives, or does that target needto change? And then longer term, do you have an aspirational gross margin target as the mix ofsoftware and hardware changes?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. We have achieved -- we've actually exceeded our long-term guidance on our operating margintarget. So we're very pleased to see that.

The launch ofAustin and Berlin, we'll have ramp inefï¬?ciencies there for some period of time until we get thosefactories up and running. And so that's likely to put some downward pressure on our margins asthose factories ramp. Our goals are to ramp those as quickly as possible. But as Drew mentionedearlier, there are a number of unknown unknowns that we'll need to work through.We are kind of also in this uncertain environment with respect to cost structure. So we are seeingcost increase on the commodity side. We're getting feedback from our suppliers, as we are seeingourselves, the impact of labor shortage. And then logistics and expedite costs just continue to be apart of our story here, and it's uncertain how that will unfold. It's our hope that these thingsstabilize. Exactly when that happens is difï¬?cult to predict, and we have been adjusting pricing inline with those changes in cost. And so we'll see how that unfolds over the course of the next year.So it's difï¬?cult on gross margin to say where that will go for those reasons.With respect to operating margin, we've been very focused as a company on managing our overheadexpenses and operating expenses. And operating expenses as a percentage of revenue has beendeclining, and I expect that trend to continue to happen. And I think the net of all of this ishopefully that we continue to make progress on operating margin over the next 4 or 5 quarters.As we think kind of forward, the business up until this point has kind of largely been a hardwareautomotive business with a little bit of software on top of that.","Zachary J.

And I know you guys have done a good job of getting long-termcontracts to sort of mitigate that impact. I mean have you seen so far any impact from that spike?And if not, I mean any sense of when that raw material headwind might actually show up or hasshown up?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. We have seen an impact. Our primary exposure right now is around nickel and aluminum,nickel on the cell, aluminum on non-cell. And we have a mixture of contracts with varioussuppliers. Some materials, we contract directly and we have full exposure to price ï¬?uctuations. Wedo have a number of long-term commitments -- long-term contracts in place. We also havecontracts where there's some amount of cost-sharing based upon the movement of indexes. And soas these have been moving, some of those costs have been ï¬?owing through to us. It's not asubstantial amount of cost but it's not small.As we look towards the next year, I certainly hope it doesn't play out this way, but it's possible thatwe continue to see more of cost headwind as a result of these movements. It's difï¬?cult to sayprecisely, but the volatility and the increases are just substantial -- so substantial. And there arecertain suppliers that, maybe up to a certain point, have been absorbing some of the increase. Andas contracts expire there or we have to renew and extend them, we'll have to return to negotiations.And so what we have to do as a company and what we are intensely focused on is we need to becontinuing to drive down the cost of our products, which we have been doing.

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSure. I don't know that I'm going to get into too many speciï¬?cs, but I guess ï¬?rst, one thing I wouldsay is unlike the commodities discussion we just had, like the anode materials are not really in thesame situation just in terms of what their constituent components are. So there's less of a focus onlike rapidly changing them one way or the other because they're generally stable commodities.There isn't exactly like a tit for tat where like get a better anode, use less cathode. Like there's afundamental ratio that you need to maintain for the cell to function.So I guess zooming out, the primary focus on the anode side that we have is just ensuring that itdoesn't, in any way -- that we are able to continue to reduce the cost of the anode without impedingon the long-term cyclability of the product. It can also help with energy density. As you like sort ofimprove the energy density of the anode, you improve the energy density of the cell, not directly 1:1because you have to pack more cathode in as the anode gets better.

2021/10/20,"And I mean tobe totally frank, it's caught us a little bit off guard. And that kind of awakening and changingconsumer sentiment, I'm sure there's lots of reasons that go into it, but folks want to buy an electriccar and folks want to buy a Tesla right now. It's very exciting for us.At the same time, we have installed capacity to build more cars but we're constrained by a numberof dynamics, as we've talked about in great detail. And we are putting an extreme effort to build asmany cars as we possibly can. It's hard to overstate how extreme the efforts are. It's quite the grind.We're trying as hard as we can to maximize that capacity and to be able to meet the demand thatwe're receiving. But the net-net of all of this is that we're not able to increase production capacityfast enough.So at the same time, we are seeing macroeconomic cost impacts on our structure, as we'vediscussed previously on the call. So what we're trying to think through -- if somebody orders a carnow, it will -- it could be delivered, in some cases, depending upon the car and which factory, couldbe a couple of months, could be a couple of quarters. And the timing in which we build that car willbe just before that car gets delivered. And what will the world look like at that point? And so we'retrying to think through, how the cost structure is evolving, how does pricing need to change withthat, what are the supply dynamics in the space.The other thing that I'll just note on pricing is that companies change pricing all the time. Thedifference is that when Tesla changes pricing, it's extremely transparent, where that's not always thecase otherwise. And sometimes, our pricing will increase. Sometimes, our pricing will reduce.Sometimes, to the public, our pricing changes may not seem to make logical sense.

And the team is moving quickly with every iteration, with every update, and they'reworking very hard on that.On your second question about the criteria to release deferred revenue, the way that this works iswe have made certain commitments as to what this product can offer at the time that a customer haspurchased that. And so what we have to assess is, have we met those commitments? And is thesoftware widely available to folks that we've made those commitments to within a certaingeography? And given that FSD is still currently in the beta phase, it's invitation-only and it'slimited, we have not deemed that to be appropriate for recognition of deferred revenue.","Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Brian Arthur Johnson - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Equity AnalystYes. Yes. It's -- by the way, great to hear there's a team at Tesla, not just a one-person show. I want todrill down a bit more on FSD. In December of 2020, in a Business Insider interview in Germany,your leader said that he expected Level 5 autonomy by December -- within a year. Yet we look at the progress in FSD and some of the issues you see on YouTube, and it looksvery much like a Level 2, 2 plus system that requires vigilances, in fact, your disclaimers cite. So Iguess 3 questions, kind of one, what is the timetable to get to Level 4 at least capability? We candeal with the regulatory stuff later. What is the criteria, for Zach, for you to release revenue -- deferred revenue around FSD? Andis having a Level2 system that needs monitoring enough to release that deferred revenue? And then three, maybe you could talk a little bit more about how you plan to work with the new --with the folks at NHTSA who appear to be asking some questions.Yes. The Autopilotteam is working extremely hard iterating on every version. We are being extremely transparentthrough the release of this to public customers who are posting information online.",,
2021/10/20,"And we'llcontinue to evolve this. We'll continue to monitor it within the ï¬?nance team to see when we get tothe milestones in which we're comfortable releasing.On the NHTSA question, Lars, do you want to take that?Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringSure. I mean as I said earlier, we always cooperate fully with NHTSA and other regulatory bodiesin any sort of investigation they may have, particularly related to ADAS systems. When they cameout with the standing general order in July, we were quick to respond to that and one of the ï¬?rst andonly companies capable of actually meeting the needs of that report. We continue to send thatinformation to them as required, weekly and as incidents occur.And with the additional investigations, as I said, we meet that with great sincerity. And we'll workthrough them one by one to make sure that all the facts come out and that NHTSA is well informedabout our strategies for both active safety in this case but also passive safety. As you guys mayknow, we released updates to our airbag and restraint system last week to Model Y using our ï¬?eetdata. We worked closely with NHTSA on that, and they were fully in the loop before we did it. So Ithink these kinds of things will continue to happen in the new regulatory space that Zach discussedas we move towards a software-based vehicle.

2021/10/20,"And the next question comes from Trip Chowdhry.Tripatinder S. Chowdhry - Global Equities Research, LLC - MD of Equity Research & SeniorAnalystVery good quarter. I had 2 quick questions. First is regarding the 2 upcoming factories in Berlin andAustin. How are the 2 factories different from each other, maybe in the layout, design, assemblylines?And the second question is related to Cybertruck. Who is the supplier looking at if you look at theexoskeleton steel? Is the supply for that material sufï¬?cient for immediate ramp-up, say, in '23, '24time for Cybertruck? That's all from me.Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringYes. Sure. So obviously, as we've noted in the past, we developed our own stainless-steel grade forthe exterior of Cybertruck to meet both the durability and corrosion requirements required for anautomotive world. With this raw material and others, as Drew mentioned, we continue to look atmultiple sources. We have made some early sourcing decisions in that, but I think we'll keep thatone internal, and we've already began the ï¬?rst casting-ins of that. Rolling stainless isn't so differentfrom pulling any other material. It's just about how hard the rollers are to get to that hardness level.And just like every manufacturing process we put in for every new vehicle, we'll work with oursuppliers and vendors to make sure those time lines and supply meet the need and demand of ourcustomers.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd on the differences between Austin and Berlin, there are some. They're largely associated withthe different sort of building architectural choices that were -- happened to occur in collaborationwith like local codes and other sort of governing requirements that drive the differences in thearchitecture between the locations. In general though, like we're trying to progress themanufacturing system as a system and make sort of logical, like, path to ï¬?nd improvements fromfactory to factory. And in some cases, there was an improvement identiï¬?ed between, like, decisionsfor one, Austin; the other, Berlin; or vice versa. And so there might be a slightly newer iteration ofone part of the factory in one place than the other, but they're -- it's all part of a -- like a pathforward in the factory that builds the machine -- the machine that builds the machine, sorry.","Lars Moravy - Tesla, Inc. - VP of Vehicle EngineeringYes.

2021/10/20,"Yes. We can hear you.Jonathan Edward Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD & AnalystSo Brandenburg, I'm just wondering, Zach, if you could estimate the carry costs from a marginperspective. Or I guess in 2 parts. So when do you expect -- do you still expect production comingon in '21, so a couple of months left in December? And how do you see that margin impact as afunction of the carry cost? And I do have a follow-up question.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOSure. So it remains our target in both Austin and Berlin to be able to build our ï¬?rst production carsbefore the end of the year. We've talked about this a bit, the unknown unknowns, new factories, newvehicle designs, new technologies, new locations, new teams. So there is quite an execution journeyahead of us. But that remains our target and all of our plans are oriented around that. We -- for -- weshould not expect for us to deliver cars by the end of 2021 from these factories even if we doproduce them -- so homologation, regulatory reasons. And we'll want to make sure that we build upsome number of cars that we're conï¬?dent in the quality and the customer experience around them.The second thing that I'll say -- and I mentioned this in my opening remarks, is because of thenewness here, it's extremely difï¬?cult for us to be precise in what the ramp will look like. And it'spossible things -- the stars align and things move quickly. It's possible that we're spending the bulkof next year working on ramping these factories. It's just very hard to say, and we'll continue toupdate you all through these calls and through other forums.As to how that then impacts our margins, that is also difï¬?cult because that is a function of the ramp,which is uncertain. So the beneï¬?t here, which is different in the ramp of these factories compared toother factories, is if you think about the percentage of our total cost structure in any given quarterthat is associated with new ramps, we have the Fremont factory that's running, generating stable andgrowing margins there. The same is also true in Shanghai. So I expect we'll see some amount ofheadwind on margin from these ramps. It's just entirely dependent on how quickly we're able toramp and what uncertainties come up during the process.Jonathan Edward Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD & AnalystSure.","Zachary J.

2022/1/26,"Senior Director of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, ZacharyKirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m.Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ï¬?lings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. So just to recap 2021, it was a breakthrough year for Tesla and for electric vehiclesin general. And while we battled, and everyone did, with supply chain challenges through the year,we managed to grow our volumes by nearly 90% last year. This level of growth didn't happen bycoincidence. It was a result of ingenuity and hard work across multiple teams throughout thecompany.Additionally, we reached the highest operating margin in the industry in the last widely reportedquarter at over 14% GAAP operating margin. Lastly, thanks to $5.5 billion of GAAP net income in2021, our accumulated proï¬?tability since the inception of the company became positive, which Ithink makes us a real company at this point. This is a critical milestone for the company.So after an exceptional year, we shift our focus to the future, Texas and Berlin. So we've begunproduction at both Texas and Berlin. We started that last quarter. But that's not the most importantthing. We focus more on when do we get to volume production and when can we deliver cars tocustomers. But I think it is worth noting that, and as the Internet has observed, we've been makingquite a few cars in Austin and Berlin.So in Texas, we're building the Model Ys with the structural battery pack and the 4680 cells, and wewill start delivering after ï¬?nal certiï¬?cation of vehicle, which should be fairly soon. Capacityexpansion will continue through maximizing output of each factory and building new factories innew locations in the future. Although we're not ready to announce any new locations on this call,but we will, through 2022, look at new locations and probably be able to announce new locationstowards the end of this year, I expect.In 2022, supply chain will continue to be the fundamental limiter of output across all factories.","Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m.Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.

2022/1/26,"Sothe chip shortage, while better than last year, is still an issue. And yes, there are multiple supplychain challenges. And last year was difï¬?cult to predict and hopefully, this year will be smooth-sailing, but I'm not sure what you do for an encore to 2021, 2020. Nonetheless, we do expect signiï¬?cant growth in 2022 over 2021, comfortably above 50% growth in 2022.Full Self-Driving. So over time, we think Full Self-Driving will become the most important sourceof proï¬?tability for Tesla. I mean actually, if you run the numbers on robotaxis, it's kind of nutty. It'snutty good from a ï¬?nancial standpoint. And I think we're completely conï¬?dent at this point that itwill be achieved. And my personal guess is that we'll achieve Full Self-Driving this year, yes, withdata safety level signiï¬?cantly greater than at present. So the cars in the ï¬?eet essentially becomingself-driving via a software update, I think, might end up being the biggest increase in asset value ofany asset class in history. We shall see. It would also have a profound impact on improving safetyand on accelerating the world towards sustainable energy through vastly better asset utilization.Let's see, so on the product road map front, there's quite a lot to talk about. I'm not going to gothrough every sort of thing that we're working on because I think a lot of them deserve productlaunches of their own as opposed to a few minutes on an earnings call. So I'll talk kind of mostly ata high level.The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output. So both last year and this year, if wewere to introduce new vehicles, our total vehicle output would decrease. This is a very importantpoint that I think a lot of people do not understand. So last year, we spent a lot of engineering andmanagement resources solving supply chain issues: rewriting code, changing our chips, reducingthe number of chips we need, with chip drama central. And that was not the only supply chainissue. So there's just hundreds of things. And as a result, we were able to grow almost 90% while atleast almost every other manufacturer contracted last year. So that's a good result.But if we had introduced, say, a new car last year, our total vehicle output would have been thesame because of the chips constraints, particularly. So if we'd actually introduced an additionalproduct, that would then require a bunch of attention and resources on that increased complexity ofthe additional product, resulting in fewer vehicles actually being delivered.","The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output.

2022/1/26,"And the same is true ofthis year so we will not be introducing new vehicle models this year. It would not make any sensebecause we'll still be parts constrained. We will, however, do a lot of engineering and tooling andwhatnot to create those vehicles: Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Optimus, and be ready to bring thoseto production hopefully next year. That is most likely. But like I said, it is dependent on are we ableto produce more cars or fewer cars.So in terms of priority of products, I think actually the most important product development we'redoing this year is actually the Optimus humanoid robot. This, I think, has the potential to be moresigniï¬?cant than the vehicle business over time. If you think about the economy, the foundation ofthe economy is labor. Capital equipment is distilled labor. So what happens if you don't actuallyhave a labor shortage? I'm not sure what an economy even means at that point. That's what Optimusis about. So very important.Drew, do you want me to talk about the 4680 program? Or is this good, the right time?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Sure. So throughout 2021, we focused on growing cell supply alongside our in-house 4680effort to provide us ï¬?exibility and insurance as we attempt to grow as fast as possible. As we sittoday, sales from suppliers actually sort of exceeds our other factory-limiting constraints that youmentioned, Elon, in 2022. Or to say differently, 4680 cells are not a constraint to our 2022 volumeplans based on the information we have.But we are making meaningful progress up the ramp curve in Kato. We're building 4680 structuralpacks every day, which are being assembled into vehicles in Texas. I was driving one yesterday andthe day before. And we believe our ï¬?rst 4680 vehicles will be delivered this quarter. Our focus onthe cell, the pack and the vehicles here is driving yield quality and cost to ensure we're ready forlarger volumes this year as we ramp and next year. And the 4680 and pack tool installations here atGiga Austin are progressing well with some areas producing ï¬?rst parts. And the Internet has alsonoticed that. Yes, I was touring the cell factory here. I'm super pumped. It's like a really excitingaccomplishment for us to bring everything into one awesome factory here in Texas.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorAbsolutely. And just to repeat Drew's point, we still expect to be partly or primarily chip limitedthis year.","Elon R.

Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. As Elon mentioned, 2021 was a ï¬?nancially transformative year for thecompany. If we look across the full year '21 and compare that to 2020, our automotive grossmargin, excluding credits, rose by over 600 basis points enabled by work on cost reduction,utilization of our Shanghai factory for exports and accelerating demand.OpEx as a percentage of revenue reduced despite the impact of onetime items and unique items.And operating income more than tripled, with operating margin reaching our guidance of mid-teens.And these margins are trending up. We also saw regulatory credits accounting for a relatively smallportion of our 2021 proï¬?tability, which we expect to continue to reduce in materiality goingforward.For Q4 speciï¬?cally, automotive gross margin, excluding credits, increased to 29.2%, which is ourhighest yet. We do continue to see some impact of higher pricing on certain models and trends aswas the case in prior quarters. But please keep in mind that due to backlogs, changes in pricing willgenerally impact our ï¬?nancials in future quarters. Supply chain challenges and port congestionresulted in a signiï¬?cant increase in our expedited costs in Q4. We also took reserves associated withwarranty and recall costs.Operating expenses were meaningfully impacted by stock-based compensation from the ï¬?nal 2tranches of the CEO stock grant becoming probable and payroll taxes associated with the exerciseof the 2012 CEO options. The total impact of these payroll taxes, warranty and recall costs andexcess expedites was just over $700 million in the quarter.Our free cash ï¬?ows have remained strong, reaching record levels in Q4 of $2.8 billion despiteincreased CapEx. In addition to using cash to grow the business as quickly as we can, we have beenretiring legacy and high interest debt. Note that we plan to continue to utilize the ABS market forproduct-speciï¬?c ï¬?nancing.As we look forward, we expect 2022 to be another signiï¬?cant and exciting year for the company.We continue to drive for vehicle volume growth at or above 50%, as Elon mentioned, and our plansshow that this is actually achievable with just our Fremont and Shanghai factories. For quite sometime now, these factories have been running below capacity due to macro challenges with supplyand logistics. As Elon mentioned as well, from what we're seeing, the pace of growth in 2022 willagain be determined by supply chain and logistics, which is quite difï¬?cult for us to forecast.Despite these constraints, it's important to begin the ramp of Austin and Berlin to ensure that we areprepared once limitations ease, enabling us to increase total output more quickly in the future.","For Q4, automotive gross margin, excluding credits, increased to 29.2%, which is ourhighest yet.

2022/1/26,"Like 6 questions.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, Dojo appears to be on track for doing something useful in the summer of this year. I think thethreshold that really matters is, at which point, when does it become more competitive than a GPUcluster for training. And obviously, the GPU cluster is getting better. So it's a moving target. Butthat's the goal I've set for the team. The FSD team running our GPU supercluster needs to tell methat they want to use Dojo instead. That's the obvious sort of threshold. And I don't know when thatwill be.I wouldn't say like success is 100% certain here. I think we just generally want to overestimatemeeting options and underestimate ourselves. But it does seem as though we might pass thatthreshold next year with Dojo if we execute well. Dojo is not needed for full self-driving but it is acost optimization on creating vast amounts of video data. Cost optimization is also a rate ofimprovement. So if you can train models faster, have a shorter iteration interval, then you can makeprogress faster. So not everything can be distributed to something like GPUs. There's someelements of serialization there.And then if Dojo is competitive, then it does seem like the kind of thing where we would offer it toother companies that want to do neural net training. Those are very much a neural net trainingoptimized system. But in theory, it should be better than a generalized computing platform or, say,GPUs, which are not really intended for -- the pixel trader is not directly intended for optimizingtraining of neural networks. They just happen to work better than CPUs in most cases. So weshould be thinking of like Dojo as like a giant ASIC optimized for neural net training, especiallyvideo [or video-like] things. But like I said, we're not saying for sure that Dojo would succeed. Wethink it will. We would encourage those who think this is an interesting problem to join Tesla.","Dojo appears to be on track for doing something useful in the summer of this year.

2022/1/26,"Okay. And the next question on insurance, when do you plan on having yourinsurance services rolled out in all the states? International rollout timing in markets that have TeslaInsurance, what kind of uptake rates are you seeing?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. We currently offer Tesla Insurance in 5 states in the U.S. Four of them are telematics, which isTexas, Illinois, Ohio and Arizona. And then California, which has a more standard insuranceoffering based upon regulations there.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIt should be clear, like we are pushing very hard for California to change the rules to allowinformatics, which basically means that you're as safe as you're driving is measured. So I think thecurrent California rules are contrary to the best interest of the consumers in California and shouldbe changed.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. And that's evidenced by what we're seeing in Texas. We've been in this market now for about 3months. And what we see in the data is the frequency of collision by folks who are given a feedbackloop on how they are driving is quite a bit lower than the frequency of collision in otherwise.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. And we can do a direct feedback on whether driving is safe. And if they drive safer, theirinsurance cost less, so they drive safer. Tesla Insurance with informatics and real-time feedbackencourages safer driving and rewards it monetarily. It's great.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOExactly. And so we see that so far in Texas. Take rates have been quite strong. We measure this onthe conversion rate from when folks quote to see what their monthly rate would be at the startingpoint to what percentage of them purchase.

2022/1/26,"Thank you. Next question is, what is your expected max capacity from each of your currentfactories: Fremont, Shanghai, Berlin and Austin and timing for new factory announcements?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI don't think we want to comment on -- it's always possible to increase the output of any givenfactory. So to say what's the next capacity, well, it's difï¬?cult to say what that next capacity isbecause you put a lot of evidence that you increase capacity quite a lot. Look at the big picture.Initially, we always want to increase capacity at one factory because logistics cost of transportingcars needs to be considered. Especially, as the cars become more affordable, you want to havefactories that are not like thousands of miles away from the customers. So even if you couldincrease output, it may not actually be the smart thing to do.So in the U.S. with, for example, with Giga Texas coming up, we would want to deliver, say, ModelYs that are going to the eastern 2/3 of the United States from this factory because the logistics costsare going to be much less. But we will continue to increase output in Fremont and at Giga Nevadaand at Shanghai. And as I said at the beginning of the call, 2022 is the year we will be looking atfactory locations to see what makes the most sense, possibly with some announcement by the endof this year, yes.","Elon Musk: It's always possible to increase the output of any given factory.

2022/1/26,"Thank you. The next question is, how much of Tesla's margin improvement is from, number one,economies of scale; number two, production line design efï¬?ciencies; number three, reducedtransportation costs from multiple plant locations; and number four, pricing versus cost inï¬?ation; ornumber ï¬?ve, other sources? And how much further could margins improve and why?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. There's basically 4 major factors if we look over the last year to the margin improvementwithin the company. And they're in no particular order here, but these are the big ones. So our mixof Model Y is increasing as we've ramped that to higher capacity in Fremont and also in Shanghai.And the reason that matters is the Model Y is a vehicle that carries a higher proï¬?t than the Model 3.And so that is helpful on our margins. And then as we increase the volume on that program withlabor efï¬?ciencies, ï¬?xed cost amortization, they improve and the costs go down as well.The second 1 here is localization in Shanghai has been a huge help for margins for the company.And the obvious things around logistics and duties is a big part of it. That factory had a differentline design, more efï¬?cient from the start, and we've been pushing the boundaries on the volumethere. So that has been helpful. If you recall, at the beginning of the year, we also were in atransition to the new version of the Model S and Model X. And so as that has ramped over thecourse of the year, that has been helpful. And then we've also done various price increases in certainmarkets on certain models, which has helped there. So that's generally the story at a high level.As we look over the next quarter or 2, as I mentioned in my opening remarks and the last call aswell, we have ramp inefï¬?ciencies from the launch of Austin and Berlin. We also have pressurescoming from inï¬?ation, supply chain, raw materials, et cetera. And so where that nets out is hard tosay in the immediate term. And we obviously, as a company, are going to be driving to increasemargins as much as we can. But I just want to be realistic that we're launching 2 factoriessimultaneously here and it unavoidably will add cost to the business as we do that.And as we look further out, and Elon mentioned this in his opening remarks as well, the softwareportion of the business, I think, is the one to really pay attention to.","Zachary J.

And the ï¬?rst question comes from Jed fromCanaccord.Jonathan Edward Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - MD & AnalystCongratulations on a great year. Elon, I guess my question is around the Megapack or your energybusiness. And so as we look at the strategy or the supply chain constraints that you mentioned, youhave 2 different strategies, or it seems like, with Megapack and Powerwall. And I think thePowerwall was answered with 4680 and the 2170 opening up. So I was wondering if you could justtalk about the supply chain and LFP for the Megapack and what we should expect for that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. To be clear, we do think that old stationary storage, Powerwall and Megapack, will transitionto an iron-based system, basically a non-nickel system. Manganese also could be part of the future,but primarily iron. It just comes up, iron-nickel. We need something that is formed in a star before asupernova ideally. So iron is. So there's a ridiculous amount of iron on Earth as is a ridiculousamount of lithium. So you can really expect all stationary storage to transition to iron over time.And manganese is like a wildcard. There's also less manganese. Anyway, I should say like we didshort-change the energy business last year in that vehicle took priority over the energy side not oncells but on chips. So yes, we do see a very long-term probably terawatt-hour per year energybusiness. So a lot, it's pretty vast.

So we don't think of itas R&D, like the product development is just one (expletive) aspect. One needs to just make greatproducts.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSo just in general, societally, there's way too much value placed on the idea. It's like you have theidea of going to the moon. That's not the hard part, okay? Going to the moon is the hard part by far.And the thing is that, that is true for really most products. So there's just way too much value placedin the idea versus execution. And we have ideas. We have gazillion ideas so many ideas we don'tknow what to do with.","Elon R.

2022/1/26,"The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.A.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystI have 2, please. First, you spoke a lot about FSD and how the economics could be very attractivegoing forward. I'm wondering if you could just share what your current attach rate might be forFSD on your vehicles or how to think about the progress of your attach rate or revenue in FSD, let'ssay, in '21 versus '20 and how much deferred revenue for FSD was drawn down during the year.And I have a follow-up, please.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think the FSD stuff, you really don't want to be looking at the rearview mirror. It will not be agood indicator for the future. What you need is to look out at the front windscreen because it is sucha profound step change. I mean effectively, long term, every car will have FSD. And the value ofthat will be a very big number. Just look at this as asset utilization, you have a passenger car, whichnormally is driven maybe 1.5 hours a day on average, maybe 10, 12 hours a week, a lot of cars inthe parking lots, so you're spending money not just driving the cars but storing them all over theplace. We can get rid of a lot of parking lots if you have a car that is operating all the time.But there will be a challenge with trafï¬?c. So we have like this little tiny baby company, The BoringCompany, which I initially started as a joke. And now I think it actually could be quite essential toalleviating the insane trafï¬?c that will happen when cars are autonomous because you reduce thepain of travel and you reduce the cost of travel so dramatically that there will be a crazy number ofcars on the road. I mean I think it will be cheaper to go point to point with a robotaxi, which is anautonomous Tesla, which every car we've made in the past 3 or 4 years will be capable of that, thana bus or a subway. It will cost less than the subsidized value of a bus ticket. So if you want to get --cool, I'm not going to take the bus.If it costs you, I don't know, for argument's sake, $2 to travel 10 miles point to point, nobody istaking the bus, especially in cold weather or it's dark or maybe a little bit dangerous, to hell withthat.","I think the FSD stuff, you really don't want to be looking at the rearview mirror.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystOkay. Elon, I was wondering if I could just follow up and ask you, you talked about your productroad map and also your goal to keep growing at 50% per year or better. That would put you at 3.2million vehicles or more in 2024. And I think you made reference to Cybertruck maybe being250,000 vehicles. If there is no $25,000 vehicle being worked on, is it really realistic to think thatyou can sell more than 3 million vehicles with 2 very high-volume cars and Cybertruck in 2024?How do we think about that? Or what else is missing in that equation?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean it's apparent from the questions that the gravity of full self-driving is not fullyappreciated. If an asset has 5x more utilization, in fact, it's like dividing the cost of that asset by 5.So if you have a $50,000 car, it's like having a $10,000 car all of a sudden. But maybe better thanthat, because still you may want to drive, so the person can be engaged in productivity oramusement instead of having to onerously drive through trafï¬?c. So it's probably better than 5x. Idon't know. Yes. I mean basically, if the cost of our cars do not change at all, we would still sell asmany as we could possibly make.","A.M.

And the question I had is,I understand well the ramp of 4680 internally, but I'd be curious to hear you talk about how youthink about 4680 as being a form factor that your suppliers could adopt as well and how you see, inthe long run, in the greater scheme of things, what does 4680 become.

Is it something that you guys are going to deploy in allcars, whatever the chemistry, also in the Megapack, in all your energy storage business? And doyou expect eventually a lot of other companies to use that form factor as well?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. On the 4680 as a form factor, yes, we've engaged with a number of our partners, our suppliers,on the form factor. And they're all working on it. And they look at it the way we look at it as a wayto drive fundamental cost efï¬?ciencies in production and also, ultimately, the design of the cell itselfto drive the cost down of the cell. I mean we're engaged because we think it's a good form factor.They're engaged because they think it's a good form factor. And we want people to make it for sure.To the question about should everything be 4680, it doesn't have to be. In the end, it's about costcompetitiveness, scalability of manufacturing. And when you compare like an iron cell with anickel cell, for example, like there are some just physics-based differences in what happens incertain corner cases that would drive different form factors, and we just have to be cognizant of thatand design to that. So it isn't like the ultimate form factor for all things. There's other form factorsthat could be better for an iron cell, for example.Elon R.","Elon R.

Our Q1 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time inthe update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events and resultscould differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in ourmost recent ï¬?lings with the SEC.(Operator Instructions)Before we jump into Q&A, Zach will have some opening remarks. Zach?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. Just to start off here, Q1 was a challenging but extremely successful quarterfor the company. Despite numerous supply interruptions, including shutdowns at our Shanghaifactory and nearby suppliers due to COVID, we've continued making progress and achieved ourbest-ever vehicle deliveries.Last quarter, we demonstrated a series of new ï¬?nancial records, including revenue, gross margins,operating margin and bottom line proï¬?tability. GAAP automotive gross margin reached 32.9% and,for the ï¬?rst time, exceeded 30% when excluding regulatory credits. Higher pricing continues topositively impact our ï¬?nancials as we make progress delivering cars in our growing backlog. Notethat, for most vehicles, our delivery wait times are quite long. Thus, cars delivered in Q1 generallycarried pricing set in prior quarters and at levels lower than cars being ordered today.Our per unit vehicle cost increased as well. Inï¬?ation, raw material prices, expedites and logisticscosts continue to impact our cost structure. Factory shutdowns also occurred with little to no notice.Hence, we are unable to take action to plan those interruptions in a cost-efï¬?cient manner.Additionally, we saw a slight mix shift towards more proï¬?table vehicles, including the Model Y . Wealso recognized a onetime beneï¬?t of $288 million from credit revenue relating to a regulatorychange in the U.S. CAFE penalty, without of which credit revenue would have declined comparedto the same period last year.The energy business has continued to be impacted by macro conditions more severely than thevehicle business. Our storage products, our need of chip supply and new import processes haveimpacted supply of certain components for our solar systems, which is reï¬?ected in our solar volumefor the quarter.OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce driven by higher revenue, lower stock-based comp expense and other items. As a result of our ongoing improvements in operating leverage, weachieved a record operating margin of over 19%.","Q1 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time inthe update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.

Additionally, we have reduced our debt, excluding productï¬?nancing, to nearly 0.Looking ahead in the immediate term, a few things to keep in mind for Q2. First, we've lost about amonth of build volume out of our factory in Shanghai due to COVID-related shutdowns. Productionis resuming at limited levels, and we're working to get back to full production as quickly aspossible. This will impact total build and delivery volume in Q2. Second, as I've mentioned before,Austin and Berlin are just starting their ramp, and thus, those inefï¬?ciencies will start to ï¬?owthrough our gross margins in Q2.

2022/4/20,"And Elon has opening remarks as well.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSure. Some of my remarks will be redundant with Zach's, but it's maybe worth repeating. Q1 wasonce again a record quarter on many levels by reaching the highest deliveries, proï¬?t and anoperating margin of 19%. This was despite a lot of chip shortages, many logistics challenges and anoverall difï¬?cult quarter. So I'd really like to congratulate the Tesla team on achieving recordproï¬?tability and output despite many, many difï¬?cult headwinds. And especially the Tesla Chinateam in our Shanghai factory, they really had signiï¬?cant challenges due to the COVID shutdownsand nonetheless have been able to output a tremendous number of high-quality vehicles, and we arealready back up and running with the Shanghai factory.So as Zach said, we remain conï¬?dent of a 50% growth in vehicle production in 2022 versus '21. Ithink we actually have a reasonable shot at a 60% increase over last year. So let's see. Obviously,we ramped production, as you will know, with Giga Berlin and Giga Texas in the past few months,so with 2 fantastic factories with great teams, and they are ramping rapidly. Now with newfactories, the initial ramp always looks small, but it grows exponentially. So I have very highconï¬?dence in the teams in both factories, and we expect to ramp those initially slowly but, like Isaid, growing exponentially with them achieving high volume by the end of this year.So we're also working on a new vehicle that I alluded to at the Giga Texas opening, which is adedicated robotaxi. That's highly optimized for autonomy, meaning it would not have steeringwheel or pedals. And there are a number of other innovations around it that I think are quiteexciting. That is fundamentally optimized for -- it's trying to achieve the lowest fully consideredcost per mile or cost per kilometer, accounting everything. And so it's, I think, going to be a verypowerful product. We aspire to reach volume production of that in 2024. So I think that really willbe a massive driver of Tesla's growth. And we remain on track to reach volume production of theCybertruck next year.So basically, once again, I'd like to thank the Tesla employees for their hard work, but also I'd liketo thank our suppliers who have really gone the extra mile. We have an amazing supplier group, andI want say heartfelt thanks to the suppliers that have really worked day and night to ensure thatTesla is able to keep the factories running.And we're really at the early stages of that journey.","Q1 wasonce again a record quarter on many levels by reaching the highest deliveries, proï¬?t and anoperating margin of 19%.

2022/4/20,"Let's go to the ï¬?rst investor question. And the ï¬?rst investor question is, Elonhas historically provided FSD time lines with, note, optimal accuracy. We love his optimism for2022 release. But is there any data Tesla can share with investors to help them make their ownconclusions on progress being made, interventions per mile driven or any other data?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSure. Well, with respect to full self-driving, of any technology development I've ever been involvedin, I've never really seen more kind of false dawns, or where it seems like we're going to breakthrough but we don't, as I've seen in full self-driving. And ultimately, what it comes down to is thatto solve full self-driving, you actually have to solve real-world artiï¬?cial intelligence, which nobodyhas solved. The whole road system is made for biological neural nets and eyes. And so actually,when you think about it, in order to solve full self-driving, we have to solve neural nets and camerasto a degree of some capability that is on par with or really exceeds humans.And I think we will achieve that this year. The best way to reach your own assessment is to join theTesla full self-driving beta program where we have over 100,000 people right now enrolled in thatprogram, and we expect to broaden that signiï¬?cantly this year. So that's my recommendation, jointhat full self-driving beta program and experience it for yourself and take note of the rate ofimprovement with every release. And we put out a new release roughly every 2 weeks. And you'llsee a little bit of 2 steps forward, 1 step back. But overall, the rate of improvement is incrediblyquick. So that's my recommendation for reaching your own assessment, literally try it.","The best way to reach your own assessment is to join theTesla full self-driving beta program where we have over 100,000 people right now enrolled in thatprogram, and we expect to broaden that signiï¬?cantly this year.

2022/4/20,"Thank you. The second question is, how much of an impact will the production shutdown inShanghai have in Q2? What is the time line for localizing the Model 3 in Europe? Or will newermodels be prioritized in Berlin?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, we did lose a lot of important days of production. And because there are sort of upstreamsupplier challenges where a lot of suppliers also lost many days of production. But Tesla Shanghai -- Giga Shanghai is coming back with a vengeance. So I think notwithstanding new issues that arise,I think we will see a record output per week from Giga Shanghai this quarter, albeit we are missinga couple of weeks. So that means the most likely vehicle production in Q2 will be similar to Q1,maybe slightly lower, but it's also possible we may pull a rabbit out of the hat and be slightly higher.But it's really, call it, roughly on par. Then Q3 and Q4 will be substantially higher. So it seemslikely that we'll be able to produce over 1.5 million cars this year. That's my best guess.And then Model 3. It's important for new factories to be focused and have the least amount ofcomplexity and variation, which is why Giga Berlin and Giga Texas are focused on the Model Y .From the point in which you have a factory complete and you're making a small number of units tothe point where it's producing high-quality vehicles in volume is sort of 9 to 12 months from start ofproduction. So now hopefully, we're getting better at that ramp, so maybe it's a little less.

The next question is, how much raw material exposure do you have, measured roughlyin percentage of cost of goods sold, for example, in a given quarter versus 1 to 2 years out, bothdirect and indirect?

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorActually, on the price increase front, I should mention that it may seem like maybe we're beingunreasonable about increasing the prices of our vehicles given that we had record proï¬?tability thisquarter, but the wait list for our vehicles is quite long. And some of the vehicles that people willorder, the wait list extends into next year. So our prices of vehicles ordered now are reallyanticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that we're aware of and believe will happen over thenext 6 to 12 months. So that's why we have the price increases today because the car ordered todaywill arrive, in some cases, a year from now. So we have a very long wait list.

2022/4/20,"Raw material exposure?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Just to add to what Elon is saying, there's different ways to calculate raw material exposure. Ithink the simple way -- we estimate around 10% to 15% of our cost structure exposed to rawmaterials. And just to clarify a couple of things on that. So we've been experiencing increases incost in general, but also raw materials, for a number of quarters now. That pace picked up in Q1, solast quarter. And what we're seeing for Q2 is slightly higher than that as well.And as indices move, it doesn't impact us immediately or directly. In some cases, we have contractswith suppliers. But then, as those contracts expire, we have to renegotiate them so that there can bea lag. In some cases, our contracts do directly reï¬?ect movement in commodity prices or rawmaterial prices. But the timing in which that Tesla pays for that has a lag associated with it as wellbased on the contract.And so to Elon's point, what we're trying to do here, because it's quite an unprecedented situation ofraw material movement in all of these various lags and uncertainty around renegotiating contracts,is we're trying to anticipate where things will go and make sure that the pricing that we have put inplace at the time that those raw material cost increases hit us is that they align and that the companycan remain ï¬?nancially healthy in various scenarios as we look out over the next 4 quarters.","Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes.

2022/4/20,"Okay. The next question is, why does Tesla continue to ï¬?ght dealership lawson a state-by-state basis versus taking it federal? Separately, why isn't Tesla using 800-voltarchitecture in its vehicles? What are the advantages or disadvantages?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSo from Tesla's standpoint, obviously, we'd love to have federal legislation that allows direct salesin all states, but we have not seen willingness on the part of the Congress to enact such law thatwould override a variety of state laws. So unfortunately, we have to ï¬?ght it on a state-by-state basis.And Drew, do you want to answer the 800-volt question?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, sure. On the 800-volt thing, yes, so it's really a case-by-case thing. For the smaller platformvehicles like 3 and Y , there's some wins and losses with 800 volts, not everything is better. And sowe look at that platform and we're not like ignoring the reality that you can go to a higher voltage,but there's nothing really encouraging us to do so on that platform. It's really about mass and power.And as you look at bigger vehicles, there are some advantages on those bigger vehicles.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorLet me just quantify that. Basically, our estimate is that going from 400 to 800 volts might save$100. It's not really moving the needle.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd you're changing many things from charging infrastructure all the way through the entirevehicle system to get maybe $100.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Exactly. So I mean, in the U.S., you've got 110-volt household power voltage and then mostpossible like sort of 220. But really, it doesn't make that much of a difference. And appliances workpretty much as well in, say, Europe as they do in the U.S. The advantages are small and the cost ishigh. Say, like long term, like years now, does it make sense probably to an 800-volt architecture?Probably. But it really needs a very big vehicle volume to pay for all the cost of changing from 400to 800 volts. And then Drew, do want to continue with it?Andrew D.

Next question is, how are the current 4680s performing versusexpectations set during the Battery Day in terms of expected range increase and dollars per kilowatthour?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. We're working in all the areas we shared on Battery Day, and we have sort of consistentprogress across all of those areas towards achieving the 5-year cost trajectory goals for the costwithin our control, but we do not control all the commodity costs. So that's an exception I needed tocall out. Similar to Model 3, it will take us several years to get rate and yields to the point whereeverything that we've discussed is achieved.

And as we attain our manufacturing goals, we will layer innew material technologies we are developing and higher-range structural pack provisions.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think maybe in a nutshell, I think it probably is fair to say that 4680 and structural pack will becompetitive with the best alternatives later this year and we think will exceed the best alternativesnext year.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. I mean we have some good existing proofs, right? Like we've built the facility here in Texas,like we know how much we spent on capital equipment in the facility. And it's more than 5x lessthan prior technology installations. So we're saving huge on CapEx, on utilities and personnel. Weknow what those loads are and how many people are needed to run what is basically a highlyautomized factory.

2022/4/20,"Thank you. And the next question is, how does Tesla plan to secure raw materials required to scaleto extreme size?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. So this is something we think about quite a lot. It depends what extreme size means. Butcertainly looking at, like, say, the $5 million, $10 million, $20 million -- 5 million, 10 million, 20million vehicle levels, you really have to analyze sort of macroeconomic, just like what is thetonnage of lithium that you need, of nickel, of iron phosphate, of graphite separators, electrolytes. Itlooks like -- really think of like just macro tonnage.And we need to think about this for the world as a whole because just -- we want to what -- there'slimiting factors for accelerating the advent of a sustainable energy future. And whatever the mostlimiting factors are, Tesla will take action on those limiting factors. So right now, we think miningand reï¬?ning lithium appears to be a limiting factor, and it certainly is responsible for quite a bit ofcost growth in the cells. It's, I think, the single biggest cost growth item right now absolutely on apercentage basis. Although just for those who don't totally know this, the actual content of lithiumin lithium ion cell is maybe around 2% or 3% of the cell.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy Engineering5 kgs a car.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, 5 kilograms exactly. It's called lithium ion cell, but by far, like the most expensive and heaviestitem in the cell is the cathode. So that's the nickel or the iron phosphate. So we're looking carefullyat all of the raw materials and trying to ï¬?gure out how we can accelerate the total amount of rawmaterials needed to transition the world to sustainability. I think we've got -- we don't have enoughtime on this call to really go through all those details, but we are thinking about these things. Andwe think we'll have some exciting announcements in the months to come.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes.

Like for the Model Y that we've built here at Giga Texas, it has both a front and a rearbody casting. So we're casting almost 2/3 of the body, and that's high pressure die casting. And sowe can take both scrap from the casting machine and the gating that comes out and put that -- justreally toss that back into the aluminum melting pot and then, as Lars was saying, also take anystampings and any other aluminum scrap also through that melting pot.

Anythingaround sort of ongoing kaizen that you've talked about in the past, maybe you could just talkthrough what you beneï¬?ted from in the ï¬?rst quarter.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOSure. I mean at a high level, cars produced in Shanghai do carry a lower cost structure than carsproduced in Fremont. And so as our mix of cars shift towards Shanghai, the average cost ispositively impacted by that. We're also seeing some progress in manufacturing efï¬?ciencies inFremont, particularly on the S and X side, as volume increases improves there. Expedites has beena huge story for the company. Q4, we had massive amounts of expedites. Q1 was still quite large,but we did make progress on bringing that down some.Elon R.

It's been very difï¬?cult with the -- I meanI think inï¬?ation is at like a 40- or 50-year high. And I think that the ofï¬?cial numbers actuallyunderstate the true magnitude of inï¬?ation. And that inï¬?ation appears to be likely to continue for atleast the remainder of this year is what -- when we're talking to suppliers, suppliers are under severecost pressure, so yes. And in some cases, we're seeing suppliers request 20% to 30% cost increasesfor parts from last year to the end of this year. So there's a lot of cost pressure there.That's why we raised our prices because we -- when things [lose sense] with respect to inï¬?ation,you know it's high, and we've got orders that go out a year or more, in some cases, then we have toanticipate those cost increases.

To be clear, it's not that there's a shortageof lithium ore in the world. Lithium is present almost everywhere. It's a very common element.However, you still need to take up the ore, take up basically the sludge or the clay with the lithium,and then you need to go through a whole series of reï¬?nement steps. And that's a lot of industrialequipment that's needed to reï¬?ne lithium ore to lithium that can be used as lithium hydroxide orlithium carbonate in a battery cell.So we think we're going to need to help the industry on this front. I mean the industry is growingfast and I certainly encourage entrepreneurs out there who are looking for opportunities to get intothe lithium business. Lithium margins right now are practically software margins. I mean Zach,correct me if I'm wrong, but I think we're seeing cases where the spot lithium price is 10x higherthan the cost of extraction. So not like we're talking [19%] margins here. Can more people pleaseget into the lithium business? Do you like minting money? Well, the lithium business is for you.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystInteresting.","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. What's sort of keeping our costs down, at least in the short term, is that we havelong-term contracts with suppliers. But the macro -- sort of looking at the worldas a whole and saying, ""Okay, what does it take for us to transition to sustainable energy faster?"" It'sfundamentally -- the fundamental limiting factor is the output of cell -- basically, cell output. Atwhat rate can lithium ion cells increase the gigawatt hours per year, that is the fundamental limit.

2022/4/20,"So I guess we'll stay tuned to see what happens from that. My second question is, it'simpressive to see just a modest increase in cost per vehicle, cost of goods sold per vehicle, givenwhat we've seen in terms of commodities actually. And from here, you have a lot of savingsopportunities with 4680 cells and the cell manufacturing changes, the anode chemistry structuralpacks, giga castings. Are you suggesting that even those may not be sufï¬?cient to offset the inï¬?ationthat you're seeing and that you're going to need additional pricing as well in addition to thosespeciï¬?c initiatives that you've called out?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe hope we don't need to increase the pricing further. The current pricing is anticipating what wethink is the probable growth in costs. And if that growth in cost does not materialize, we actuallymay slightly reduce prices. So we don't currently anticipate making signiï¬?cant price increases. Butobviously, we don't control the macroeconomic environment. If governments keep printing vastamounts of money and if there are not signiï¬?cant increases in lithium extraction and reï¬?nement andother raw materials such that everyone is competing for a limited amount of raw materials then,obviously, that will drive prices to high levels. So if you have a crystal ball that can tell us what thefuture is going to be like, we'll adjust accordingly. But the current prices are for a vehicle deliveredin the future, like 6 to 12 months from now. So this is our best guess.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringBut I think if you zoom out, right, like as you said, our mission is to accelerate the transition tosustainable energy. So we are working with our existing suppliers and others to ï¬?gure out how togrow all of these raw materials as quickly as possible to not slow down the transition. And whetherthat means we have to get directly involved in some cases or not comes down to the counterpartyand their willingness to expand at the rate we think they should be able to expand. And that'ssimilar to what we've done with everything else. Like we built a Gigafactory in Reno because itneeded to be done. And so like we will do what needs to be done to not slow down the transition.And affordability is a goal. If it's unaffordable, it's going to retard the growth of what is inherently agood thing.","Elon R.

2022/4/20,"Yes.Colin M. Langan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity AnalystPerfect. Just to follow up, sorry to keep going on the raw material issue on the battery side, butobviously, it seems pretty important. How quickly can raw material supply be built? Because myunderstanding is it takes many years to build that out. So are we just sort of phasing? When do youthink we see a lithium shortage or a nickel shortage? And is there even enough time to build thatsort of mining capacity in place? And then related, how quickly can you switch to like LFP for thenickel issue?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. I mean I'll take the LFP question. Like it says so in our letter, like half of our products wereLFP last quarter, which shows how quickly we were able to respond to -- well, honestly, it wasn'tbecause of a raw material shortage but just because it seemed like the right thing to do, we couldchange our cathode chemistry. And there's more to be done on the cathode side, and we are activelypursuing it to give us substitution ï¬?exibility in response to market conditions between the othercathodes that are out there that can be competitive in our vehicles for which there are many options.I guess what I would say is, speciï¬?cally on the cathode side, like ï¬?exibility is the way we're goingto achieve this. And not all of the materials that go into cathodes are actually, ï¬?rst of all, hard tosecure like through mining or reï¬?ning; and second of all, in many cases, are like very plentifulalready, like huge scale. And if all of the batteries in the world use those cathodes, it's less than a1% increase in total annual output. So that's the cathode side.I think Elon already spent a lot of time talking about lithium. It really depends on the resource.Some resources like just getting rocks out of the ground. Expanding the amount of rock that you'regetting out of the ground is maybe a little bit of paperwork and some additional sort of blasting andtrucking operations. The reï¬?ning is maybe where it's a little bit more chunky to bring it online. Butalso the reï¬?ning doesn't -- it's not like an oil reï¬?nery. It's a much, much smaller operation to reï¬?nelithium out of spodumene or liquid like a brine or a salt pond evaporation. So you're talking about atime scale of 1 to 2 years.","How quickly can raw material supply be built? Because myunderstanding is it takes many years to build that out.

So just as a Q2 recap, Q2 was a unique quarter for Tesla due to a prolongedshutdown of our Shanghai factory. But in spite of all these challenges, it was one of the strongestquarters in our history. Most importantly, in June, we achieved production records in both Fremontand Shanghai. And as a result, we have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year.I do want to emphasize this is obviously subject to force majeure, things outside of our control. Thepast few years have been quite a few force majeures, and it's been kind of supply chain hell forseveral years. Credit to our awesome Tesla supply chain team for overcoming in saving difï¬?cultchallenges. And huge thanks to the Tesla Shanghai factory team who sacriï¬?ced a lot to get thefactory back up and running in June and achieve a record output.So also making good progress with production ramp with Berlin. We achieved an importantmilestone of 1,000 cars a week in June. And we're expecting -- sorry, our Giga Texas to exceed the1,000-vehicle per week milestone and hopefully in the next few months.To be clear, we're currently making the cars with the 2170 cells, and Drew Baglino will addresssome of the 4680 questions later in this call. But it is worth emphasizing that we have enough 2170cells to satisfy all vehicle production for the remainder of the year. So we're not dependent on 4680.4680 will be important next year but it is not important for this year.That said, we have installed the second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells inTexas. And even at our established factories like Fremont and Shanghai, we continue to expandcapacity.Regarding Autopilot, we have now deployed our FSD Beta with City Streets driving capability toover 100,000 owners.","During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhornand a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.

2022/7/20,"They're very happy with the capability of the system and we'll continue toimprove it every week. We've now driven over 35 million miles with FSD Beta. That's moreautonomous miles than any company we're aware of, I think probably more than -- it might be more than any -- all other companies combined. So -- and that mileage is growing exponentially.With regard to manufacturing and technology, about 5 or 6 years ago, we said we wanted to becomethe best manufacturer in the world and that is somewhat counterintuitively, to some people, willactually be, I think, our strongest competitive advantage. We're super pro-manufacturing here atTesla. And in general, we want to encourage other companies to be super pro-manufacturing. Andin general, I think it is a very important thing to do. We need to make stuff and make it efï¬?cientlyand that's manufacturing.So we've made a lot of advancements in manufacturing processes. As we now show in theshareholder deck, thanks to our -- the large castings, we make the world's largest castings. Wereduced body welding robot count by 70% per unit of capacity in Austin and Berlin. So that's, callit, roughly a body shop that is roughly 3x smaller than would normally be the case. And I shouldsay it's also lighter, cheaper and has superior noise vibration harshness. So it's good on every level.But this journey is not over. We'll bring another level of simplicity and manufacturingimprovements with Cybertruck and future products that we're not quite ready to talk about now butI think will be very exciting to unveil in the future.Our safety team also introduced a feature that tension seat builds, if the vision system detectsimminent collision, which has never been done before. So you can imagine that if you have aseatbelt that only tensions upon impact, you have very little time to tension the seatbelt. If you'vegot to be -- the car has got to be crunching to trigger the seatbelt tensioner. But because we havevision, we can actually see that a collision is about to occur with 100% probability before it actuallyhappens.And so we can tension the seat belts, and we can even adjust the airbag deployment because we cansee, not just feel. This is a fundamental safety advantage that Teslas are now able to offer. Andthere's also an over-the-air update, so this is something that will be in place in all cars that have atleast AP3 hardware.In conclusion, we exited Q2 with a strong production rate than ever before.","We've now driven over 35 million miles with FSD Beta.

2022/7/20,"Our team continues tofocus on Cybertruck production readiness and some future platform design. We are expecting to be-- still expecting to be in production with the Cybertruck in the middle of next year. And we're very,very excited about that product. I think it might actually be our best product ever.Let's see. FSD Beta is on track to be released for all of North American customers before the end ofthis year. And hopefully, if we get regulatory approval, we'll also be releasing it hopefully in Europeand some other parts of the world.We're hosting our AI Day in a few months.

I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team on an excellent executionduring the second quarter. Although our production volume reduced sequentially due to COVID-related shutdowns in Shanghai, we made substantial progress in nearly every area of the business,and in particular, our global vehicle production rate as we exited the quarter.Our Fremont factory, supported by our Reno team, reached new production records. The Shanghaifactory resumed full production, and our new factories in Austin and Berlin are progressing wellthrough their initial ramps.Additionally, our energy business achieved record gross proï¬?t with the highest solar volumes inmany years. I want to personally thank the entire Tesla team, as I know many of you are listening.You've embodied a remarkable and relentless pursuit of excellence in support of our mission. I alsowant to thank our suppliers for their support during another complicated quarter.On GAAP automotive gross margin, it declined sequentially to 27.9%. The temporary decline inShanghai production volume meaningfully impacted margin, including idle capacity and factoryrestart costs and also had implications on the mix of regional deliveries.Additionally, as discussed on previous calls, we are working through the ramp inefï¬?ciencies of ournew factories, which are progressing well but have had an impact on margin as those factories comeonline. While we continue to see a beneï¬?t from higher pricing ï¬?owing through, which experiencedsome foreign exchange-related headwinds, our cost structure continues to experience cost increasesfrom inï¬?ation, commodities and logistics.The energy business progressed well in Q2, aided by alternate solar supply coming online andprogress on unit economics. Our storage business remains component-constrained on bothPowerwall and Megapack, which we hope will alleviate to some extent in the second half of theyear. We are greatly appreciative of the patience and ï¬?exibility shown by our customers while wework through these challenges.Within operating expenses, Boston and Berlin-related start-up costs have wound down as thesefactories have moved into production and their costs are now reï¬?ected in automotive COGS.Additionally, we converted a majority of our Bitcoin holdings to ï¬?at for a realized gain, offset byimpairment charges on the remainder of our holdings, netting a $106 million cost to the P&Lincluded within restructuring and other. We also incurred restructuring charges related to targetedstafï¬?ng reductions.Elon R.

And the ï¬?rst question is,Chinese EV manufacturers seem to be doing a better job than their Western competitors, excludingTesla, at innovating in software and design. How can Tesla make sure the company is staying aheadof those manufacturers, both within China and outside of China?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, the -- right now, the best Chinese EV manufacturer is Tesla train. We're actually doing thebest, thanks to our incredible team in China. But I have a lot of respect for the Chinese, ourmanufacturers and EV manufacturers in particular. I think they will be a force to be reckoned withworldwide. They're very -- they're smart and they're hardworking. And I think anyone who is not --any company that's not as competitive as them will obviously suffer a share decline.

2022/7/20,"Thank you. The next question is, when will Tesla have a uniï¬?ed vector space for both static andmoving object network? Will this be a V11 or later version? If the latter, can you explain whatmakes it a difï¬?cult problem in layman terms?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorOkay. This answer will be understood by 0.01% of the audience, I think. I suppose people want toï¬?nd out what a uniï¬?ed factory space would actually mean. It essentially would be if you can take --if instead of netting together static and dynamic objects in C++, if they could be net together at theneural net level, then you don't need to reconcile them within C++ heuristics.That is an architecturally better way to -- that's the most desirable outcome. It's -- I think it'sprobably not necessary to achieve full self-driving, but it would be a slight improvement in theefï¬?ciency of the self-driving. And it's certainly something we want to get to. Yes. The sort ofnirvana situation is you have surround video/auto labeling of all static and dynamic objects. Andyou have then surround video inference with spatial memory as well.Then that's -- I mean, I think we're almost certainly there before the end of the year. Yes, I'm notsure how many you would understand that. But I should say also, we are also conï¬?dent ofimproving the frame rate and as we some of the legacy neural nets, we think we might be able to getto the frame rate of what the -- only cameras is maybe up to 36 fps, which is actually a lot offrames, considering it cameras. It's certainly comfortably above 24 frames, which is basically themovie -- frame rate of movies.","The next question is, when will Tesla have a uniï¬?ed vector space for both static andmoving object network?

2022/7/20,"Thank you. The next question is Elon recently tweeted about lowering prices once inï¬?ation coolsdown. Can you elaborate on what do you mean by cooling down and how aggressively thecompany will lower prices? More broadly, how do you think about the auto pricing long term?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. So since we have -- there's a quite a long wait when somebody orders in a car, in some cases, 6months; in some cases, it could be up to a year. We have to anticipate what the probable inï¬?ationrate is over that period of time. So that's what we're trying to do. When we -- when or if we seeindications that the inï¬?ation rate is declining, then we would not need to increase our car prices. It'spossible that there could be a slight decrease in car prices, but this is fundamentally dependent onmacroeconomic inï¬?ation. It's not something we control.If I were to guess, and I would take this with a grain of salt, I think inï¬?ation will decline towardsthe end of this year. We're certainly seeing prices of commodities trending lower. Yes. But take itwith a grain of salt. This is -- making economic prognostication is fraught with error. I don't know ifyou guys want to -- do you want to say anything about...Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. We're certainly seeing, I mean, it's kind of a whole spectrum. On the battery metal side, forexample, the price of lithium has really shot up. We used to be $11 a kilogram to more than $80 akilogram. But it's -- not every situation is that bad so it's kind of a spectrum.Unidentiï¬?ed Company Representative -Carbon steel, aluminum, (inaudible) carbon steel and aluminum has started trending down. We willsee the beneï¬?ts of it only probably later part of this year or early next year.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. But I think that's just like for most commodities, we're seeing a downward trend towards theend of this year or next year. Some commodities, the pricing of lithium is insane. I would like to,once again, urge entrepreneurs to enter the lithium reï¬?ning business. The mining is relatively easy.The reï¬?ning is much harder.So lithium is actually a very common -- sort of very -- like lithium pretty much everywhere.

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, do you want to do the architecture?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. So structural pack where we get dual use of the battery cells as structure and as energy storagein the same way that an aircraft gets dual use of the wing as a fuel tank and as a wing is, I think,unequivocally, from a physics standpoint, the superior architecture. It's the A architecture.Now because it is new, we'll start off getting, I don't know, aspirationally a C within an Aarchitecture. But the potential is there for to get radically better and then unequivocally better than abattery pack, which is carried like a sack of potatoes.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. And we've gained the perspective through putting our ï¬?rst structural pack in production that itis actually the A architecture.

And now we've actually built and are moreconï¬?dent in that assertion.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. So exactly. So the structural pack, even the C and the A architecture is beating thenonstructural pack. And so over time, it will, with further reï¬?nement, be substantially superior to acar that is carrying a battery pack as though it is cargo.

2022/7/20,"Thank you. The next question is, how is the 4680 ramp going? And is Giga Texas producing cellsyet?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. So we are making progress on 4680. But right now, as Elon mentioned, we are leveragingsupplier cells, which we have in sufï¬?cient quantity to ramp Texas and Berlin. We expect to ramptotal 4680 production to exceed 1,000 per week by the end of the year, hopefully before -- wellbefore.In Q2, at Kato we fully automated (inaudible) for the dry anode-electrode tool there, unlockingmajor increases in production and improvements in yields. Since March because of that, Katooutput has grown about 35% month-over-month each month since, and yields throughout thefactory are already at targets in most areas and trending in that direction and a few others.We did feed learnings from Fremont cell and pack lines to Texas and Berlin there, a carbon copy.Cell design was revved to unlock higher performance and manufacturing simplicity. Manufacturinglines were further integrated and we in-sourced additional content. For these reasons, there are somenew ramp challenges to overcome in Texas and Berlin.Speciï¬?c to Texas last quarter, cell equipment was fully installed and commissioned and weproduced our ï¬?rst commissioning car sets of cells through the end of the line. Our target for Texasis to begin production this quarter and aim for Texas to be capable of exceeding Kato weekly outputbefore the end of this year.","In Q2, at Kato we fully automated (inaudible) for the dry anode-electrode tool there, unlockingmajor increases in production and improvements in yields.

2022/7/20,"The next question is on 4680 as well, but I think Andrew has coveredeverything that was in the next question.So the following question is with regards to the ramp of production in Austin and Berlin. How isthe situation with regards to supply of semiconductors, battery cells and other components? Howabout cost inï¬?ation impacting proï¬?tability of these other plants?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringI can take that. So Tesla procures about 1,600 unique pieces of silicon from 43 semiconductorcompanies. So with a portfolio of that size, there are always challenges. Things are more stable onthe latest generation chips. We still see some tightness in the older generation semiconductors,especially in the analog and mixed signal space. But we have line of sight to solve for the volumesbeing contemplated for both Austin and Berlin.And on the cell front, like Elon mentioned, we have a comfortable margin, thanks to record outputfrom our partners and have line of sight that matches the planned output from both factories. We'vegrown cell production signiï¬?cantly on a 12-month rolling basis and have long-term contracts withall our partners for key battery metals. So we don't see any major problems for the components, ofcourse, barring unforeseen COVID-related shutdowns.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOJust to add on the proï¬?tability part of the question. Q2 was our largest increase yet over the lasthandful of quarters on inï¬?ation and commodity-related increases to our cars. It's fairly evenlyspread across the factories, given common suppliers or common issues that impact the broad supplychain.So I think I had mentioned before that we have been seeing increases over the course of last year. Itticked up in Q1 and then it ticked up again at the rate of increase was more in Q2. So as we lookthrough to the end of the year, what we're seeing is we don't think the inï¬?ation-related increases inQ3 will be as big as Q2. But as Elon has mentioned, there is uncertainty on pricing here.And we don't have full exposure, as [Karen] had just mentioned, on every component of costbecause we do have some contracts in place. But there are some spot buys as well and somecontracts being renegotiated. So we're managing it with pricing and in partnership with oursuppliers but it does continue to be something that is impacting our ï¬?nancials.","Tesla procures about 1,600 unique pieces of silicon from 43 semiconductorcompanies.

2022/7/20,"Great. And now let's go to analyst questions. The ï¬?rst question comes fromPierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Pierre, feel free to unmute yourself.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureI'd like to ask like a question on 4680 and the structural battery pack. And I'd love to understandwhere you stand on the technology and efï¬?ciency and energy density road map that you describedat the Battery Day. So what I'm trying to understand is where do you stand on the architecture of thebattery cell itself? How much silicon do you have in it? How much energy improvement have youachieved already so far?And the reason why I'm asking that is because you have like very smart guys on Twitter who sharedexperience about trying to fully empty a Model Y from Texas from Austin and noticing behaviorsand like recharging behavior that suggested that maybe these cars had like very, very high mileage,very high range, and were like artiï¬?cially limited in range in software. So I'm just kind of trying tounderstand how much of an edge you're building at the moment with the 4680 and the battery backon range.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. Let me just try to provide like a super straightforward answer. Like as Elon mentioned before,our priority was really on simplicity and scale during the initial 4680 and structural battery ramp.So we weren't like putting all the bells and whistles in from day 1 because if so, we would be sort ofsuffering under a string of serious miracles that we would need to achieve to get going.But as we attain the manufacturing goals that we've stated at the ramp that we need to hit next year,we are certainly planning to layer in new material technologies and higher-range structural packs,like we're not like holding back goodies for some rainy day or something like that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Maybe another way of putting it is that the -- our focus right now is on the dozens of littleissues that inhibit the production ramp of the 4680. Some of the more challenging ones have beenfeeding the anode-cathode material because we're using this revolutionary dry electrode process.But when something is revolutionary, it's a lot of unknowns that have to be resolved.So we're conï¬?dent of resolving those unknowns but it's very, very difï¬?cult.","Elon R.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorBut I should also emphasize that it is not as though Tesla intends to displace our suppliers of batterycells. The Tesla battery cell production is in addition to what our suppliers can do. And we want oursuppliers to grow their battery output as fast as they possibly can, and that goes for the entire supplychain.The fundamental rate limiter for both transitioning to sustainable energy is how fast can you growwith the amount of battery output per year?

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, I just want to stress that a lot of these higher energy density technologies are not necessarilyscalable. I mean, most of them are not scalable from what I've seen. And so like focusing on them isa distraction from the mission, like it really is how do we scale as fast as possible?And we're taking these risks that we've discussed at Battery Day.

2022/7/20,"Even if there was 0 technologybreakthroughs, so it literally 0 from where the technology is right now, we could fully transitionEarth to sustainable energy. The issue is very much the rate at which the entire supply chain frommining to reï¬?ning to cell production. How fast can that grow? It's growing fast with the faster itgrows, the faster we transition to a sustainable energy economy.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureThis is actually a great -- exactly where my follow-up is. So Elon, you always mention this 50% perannum sustainable growth target that you guys have. And so my question here is when we see likethe difï¬?culty regarding the commodities, raw materials, swinging prices, I'm kind of wondering, asyou are planning for this 50% per annum growth, if we stand today over the next 5 to 10 years, howmuch of that do you feel you've secured through your work at entering into long-term contracts andthings like that? And you were calling for entrepreneurs to go into the lithium business.So does that mean you don't have enough lithium secured to grow 50% per annum over multipleyears? And what's -- how much of that is secured today? And how fast can you improve thatbasically?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, I think it's kind of very difï¬?cult to predict anything 10 years from now. I hope civilization isstill around, frankly. I don't count that as a win.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureNot that fun.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. Hopefully, we haven't had World War III by then. So the -- we do see constraints inreï¬?ning of the materials necessary for lithium ion batteries. I do want to emphasize this as -- it isnot due to a scarcity of the raw material. In the case of lithium, lithium is one of the most commonelements on Earth. It's pretty much everywhere.But reï¬?ning of the lithium into ultra-high purity battery-grade lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonateis quite difï¬?cult and requires a massive amount of machinery and it's a hard thing to scale. As it wasalso difï¬?cult to create the anode and cathode.I think -- my guess is maybe 2/3 of batteries will be iron phosphate or maybe iron phosphate withsome manganese. And there's plenty of -- there's a ridiculous amount of iron.","Elon Musk: Even if there was 0 technologybreakthroughs, we could fully transitionEarth to sustainable energy.

I have a question on your vehicle demand and then a quick follow-up on supply. First, on thedemand side. Are you seeing any sort of pressure in the order book or the pace of new order or anysort of like slowdown as a result of the pressures that the consumer is experiencing? Are youworried about it in light of your view of the risks to the economy that I think you expressed, Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, right now, our problem is very much production.

Our problem is overwhelmingly that of production. So yes.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOOkay. Maybe just 2 things to add.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSome maybe.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOBut it's not material. The second thing to Elon's point about backlogs, we have a very long runwaywith very long lead times here. I mean, certainly, the world is uncertain, and we'll have to see wherethings go with commodity prices, how quickly we're ramping production, what the state of the roadlooks like at some point next year. But the demand is not something we spend really any timetalking about.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I think it's -- maybe just 1 thing worth mentioning the -- that there is surface between value formoney and fundamental affordability because sometimes people say, ""Well, if you got all thisdemand. Why don't you just raise the price to some -- double the price or something?"" And this isusually expressed by somebody who's rich.But there's -- even if you rail value for money to inï¬?nity, if somebody does concerns, do not haveenough money to buy it, even a product where the desirability is rail to inï¬?nity, they basicallycannot buy it. So this is why you kind of just raise prices to some arbitrarily high level because youpass the affordability boundary and then the demand falls off a cliff.So I do feel like we've raised our prices or we raise the price quite a few times.","Elon R.

We've heard a lot from others and certainly to some degreefrom you all about the shortages in semiconductors, in particular. We have seen some big, importantcustomers of that type of product decide to sort of leverage the ecosystems that exist to make someof their own in those categories.I'm wondering to what degree you're doing that. That's outside of Dojo in terms of the -- I guess, onthe inference side, you're certainly doing that in the car, but what about sort of the more mundaneareas like microcontrollers and the like? Is there any internal effort to improve supply chain andmaybe improve other performance aspects?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, there's we've done -- we've been working with our suppliers side. We don't currently intend tomake chips ourselves. We don't think there will be a need to make chips, but we have been workingclosely with a number of suppliers. Actually just met with one of our key supplier's CEOs rightbefore this call. We had a great meeting. They're going to make major investments in some of thecritical chips and components that we need in the car.And I'd actually like to take a moment to thank our key suppliers once again for supporting usthrough difï¬?cult times. And they really went above and beyond to support us. So to all our suppliersout there, thanks very much.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes.

2022/7/20,"So we try to go after where there's actually a technical advantage. And in thefuture, I think we're going to look at where there's a supplier...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & Director(inaudible) even now where the supply chain issues with our Tier 1s and Tier 2s, get into it with uson the engineering side when we ï¬?nd solutions, whether it's alternative chips or changing the entirestructure of this pack to make it work. And I think that's an advantage we have that many other OEsjust simply cannot.I think Tesla is as much a software company as it is a hardware company. And so one of the waysthat we've been able to address supply chain issues on the chip front is by rewriting of software tobe able to use different chips or, in some cases, achieve dual use of a single chip, which is evenbetter. And actually, quite frankly, the chip shortage has served as a forcing function for us toreduce the number of chips in the car. Yes, it turns out we had more chips than we needed.But that's a testament to our software team that we're able to roll a new chip into the car, write awhole new patch of software for that chip and -- without interrupting production.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. And our goal is as we mature and scale the platforms is to integrate more functionality intofewer chips, like that is the way that it's gone with laptops and phones. It's going that way in cars.And we're trying to do that wherever it makes sense to do it as quickly as we can.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorFrom a supply chain standpoint, do we -- what do you think about the chips and whatnot?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. I think -- I mean, from a high level, instead of designing and building our ownmicrocontrollers, we're partnering with key partners that understand the architectural requirementsand they'll take the specs and design something for us. We've done that, to your point, the batterysensing space. We've got some application-speciï¬?c ICs. But yes, integrating, reducing the numberof components, it's a mix of supply chain but it also makes the reliability of the end product betterbecause there's less failure points.

2022/10/19,"I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhornand a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time inthe update that we published at the same link as this webcast.During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ï¬?lings with the SEC. During the Q&A session portion of today's call, please limit yourself to1 question and 1 follow-up. (Operator Instructions) But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has someopening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you, Martin. So just to do a Q3 recap. Q3 was another record quarter on many levels. We hadour industry-leading operating margin reached 17%. And our free cash ï¬?ow surpassed $3 billion inQ3 and approached $9 billion in the past 12 months. As our factories ramp, we're looking forwardto a record-breaking Q4. So it really, knock on wood, it looks like we'll have an epic end of year. SoQ4 is looking extremely good.On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week withvery good quality and is ramping rapidly. Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestonevery soon. And in fact just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday's hold rate, it would be 2,000.Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter. We are ï¬?nallygaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell. And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to startincorporating in cars and having it be a signiï¬?cant portion of our production here in Texas in thecoming months. We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells inTexas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont.The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3. And we intend to keepraising production in Fremont.Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and showed the ï¬?rstprototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range ofimprovements of full self-driving software.Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving beta mode, and this numbercontinues to grow exponentially. Our goal with that AI Day was recruiting, and we've seen amassive inï¬?ux of world-class artiï¬?cial intelligence engineer and scientist resume.","During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.

2022/10/19,"So it generated atremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world. I can't emphasizethe importance of this enough because I think it ï¬?nally has become clear to the smallest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best.So this quarter, we expect to go to wide release of full self-driving beta in North America. Soanyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving will have access to the FSD Betaprogram this year, probably about a month from now. So and then, obviously, any new -- anyonewho buys a car and purchase a full self-driving option will immediately have that available to them.So the safety that we're seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually signiï¬?cantly greater than thesafety we're seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta.Let's see, with respect to demand. We've got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks. I can'temphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we makefor as far into the future as we can see. So the factories are running at full speed, and we'redelivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong. We are still a very smallpercentage of the total vehicles on the road. Of the 2 billion trucks on the road, we only have about3.5 million. So we're about a long way to go to even reach 1% of the global ï¬?eet.Let's see. Based on my -- what people -- based on many things, but certainly questions I get onTwitter about buybacks. And I think every one of our Board members has gotten questions aboutbuybacks. The -- we've debated the buyback idea extensively at the Board level. The Boardgenerally thinks that it makes sense to do a buyback. But we want to work through the right processto do a buyback, but it's certainly possible for us to do a buyback on the order of $5 billion to $10billion. Even in the downside scenario next year, even given if next year is a very difï¬?cult year, westill have the ability to do a $5 billion to $10 billion buyback. This is obviously pending Boardreview and approval. So it's likely that we'll do some meaningful buyback.So in conclusion, while the market theme revolve around the short term, it's very important to focuson the long term.","This quarter, we expect to go to wide release of full self-driving beta in North America.

2022/10/19,"I can't emphasize this enough with investors. And I think long-time investors,obviously recognize this with Tesla. We have our sort of local ups and downs, but long-term trendhas been extremely good. And several years ago I said, I think on our earnings call, that I thought itwas possible for Tesla to be worth more than Apple, which was then the highest market capcompany, I think, in the market. And Apple, at that time, I think was around $700 billion. And Isaid it required incredible execution and at least some luck.And we didn't only achieve that. Tesla went, in fact, or passed Apple's market cap at the time. Andnow I am of the opinion that we can far exceed Apple's current market cap. In fact, I see a potentialpath with Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. So now that doesn'tmean it will happen or that will be easy. In fact, I think it will be very difï¬?cult. It will require a lotof work, some very creative new products, managed expansion and, always, luck.But for the ï¬?rst time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let's say, roughly twice the valueof Saudi Aramco. I think that's -- I haven't quite seen that yet. I mean this is the ï¬?rst time I've seenthat potential.So we have an incredible product portfolio. I think we've got the most exciting product portfolio ofany company on earth, some of which you've heard about, some of which you haven't. We're in theï¬?nal lap for Cybertruck. We're building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas Austin and making alot of progress in the robotaxi platform design.And then with respect to batteries, we're moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve 1,000gigawatt hours a year of production capacity in the United States, vertically integrated. And ourcathode reï¬?ning, we're moving a ton of speed to do that.So I think it's an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future.

2022/10/19,"And Zach has some opening remarks as well.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. Thanks, Martin. Just to continue on Elon's theme, I just want to thank and congratulate theTesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the thirdquarter.On automotive proï¬?tability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2%, with automotive gross marginat 27.9%. Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage.However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it toQ1.Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been ourstrongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%. Note that while small andgrowing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to proï¬?tability.We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, aswe've discussed at length on prior calls. In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchangewas a big part of this past quarter.On energy proï¬?tability, we achieved our strongest gross proï¬?t yet for this business, driven primarilyby record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products. Our free cash ï¬?ows were also arecord despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact onworking capital.Speciï¬?cally on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2, we've started toexperience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn't anticipate. This issue isparticularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of theU.S. and Europe. Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads toextreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the ï¬?nal weeks of each quarter. Just to putthis in perspective, roughly 2/3 of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and 1/3 in the ï¬?nal 2weeks. As a result, we have begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduceour peak needs for outbound logistics. We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs andimprove the experience of our customers.As we look ahead, our plans show that we're on track for the 50% annual growth in production thisyear, although we are tracking supply chain risks, which are beyond our control. On the deliveryside, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end ofthe year, as noted, just above. This means that, again, you should expect a gap between productionand deliveries in Q4, and those cars in transit will be delivered shortly to their customers uponarrival to their destination in Q1.Boston and Berlin ramp costs will continue to weigh on margins, although we expect the impact tobe less than what we saw in Q3.","On automotive proï¬?tability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2%, with automotive gross marginat 27.9%.

2022/10/19,"Right. Thank you.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorOf course, there's Tesla Semi, of course. So we'll be handing over our ï¬?rst production of TeslaSemis to Pepsi on December 1. I'll be there in person.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly, very important, no sacriï¬?ce to cargo capacity, 500-mile range. Just to be clear, 500miles with the cargo. Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground. Yes, sure. Not up. It'sexcellent. But the point is it's a long-range truck and even with heavy cargo. And the number oftimes people told me, ""Oh you can't, it's impossible to make a long-range heavy-duty Class Atruck."" And then I'll ask, well, what are your assumptions about what hours per kilogram and whathours per mile, and they look at me with a blank stare and then say hydrogen.I'm like, no, that's not the answer. I was looking for numbers literally. That's not a number.Hydrogen is on a periodic table. You obviously don't need hydrogen for heavy trucking, for thetruck we make here.And we'll be ramping up Semi production through next year. As I think everyone knows at thispoint, it takes about a year to ramp up production. So we expect to see signiï¬?cant -- we'retentatively aiming for 50,000 units in 2024 for the Tesla Semi in North America. And obviously,we'll expand beyond North America.

2022/10/19,"Thank you. The next question is, what is the progress of the 4680 cell ramp? And what factorsdetermine whether vehicles get 2170s versus 4680 cells? And how will that change in the nextyear?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, ramp is going well, as Elon said. Total output is up 3x quarter-over-quarter, and production istracking to exceed 1,000 car cells per week this quarter, as we said last quarter. Our focus is nowshifting from 100% ramp to cost and further expanding production capacity in North America, asElon also mentioned.On the 2170 versus 4680, in our factories, we really attempt to minimize factory complexity andproduct changeover while still making sure we get enough new product into the ï¬?eld to learn how itis performing. And that sort of mix is going to shift as 4680 scales here and the overall factory rampproceeds in Texas.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorRight. Basically, production of 4680 ramp is growing exponentially. And yes, it's going well. It'slooking good. This is going to be a very major product in the future.Yes. And like I said, we're -- our goal is to strive towards 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of annualizedproduction in United States alone by Tesla, not including suppliers. It will be on top of that.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringWe need to get 300 to 400 terawatt hours cells to accomplish our goal.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, there's roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our rough calculation for both stationaryand for vehicles is 300,000 to 400,000 gigawatt hours or 300 to 400 terawatt hours.Andrew D.

And on the cathode side, the main cathode we think will probably be iron and most of the ironcan scale to very, very high tonnage and then some nickel.

2022/10/19,"Yes. Thank you. The next question is on the Semi truck, which we already addressed. So I'm goingto skip to the next one. Can you talk about how Tesla could adjust if we were to enter a prolongedrecession, including new product prioritization, investment ï¬?exibility, new factory versus factoryexpansion, service support infrastructure, productivity cost measures and demand stimulationalternatives?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, to be frank, we're very pedal to the metal, rain or shine. So we are not reducing our productionin any meaningful way, recession or not recession.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringIt's the 1% point you made.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, exactly. So I think the public, at large, realizes that the world is moving towards electricvehicles. And that it's foolish to actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residualvalue of that gasoline car is going to be very low. So I think we are in a very good spot. But Iwouldn't say it's recession-proof. But it's certainly recession-resilient because, basically, it has --people both have large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars.And then in transitioning electricity generation to sustainable, you need solar and wind with thestationary battery pack to buffer the power. So you have 24/7 power because the wind doesn't blowand the sun doesn't shine all the time. So that also -- we actually see the energy storage business,stationary storage, growing more like 150% to 200% a year, much faster than cars by a lot.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOJust to add before you jump in, Martin. Just to echo Elon's point, I mean, I think where our cashbalance is, what our forecasted cash generation is, where our margins are as a company, I mean wecan withstand quite a lot of downside before we would have to dig into our capital plans,Supercharger expansion, product lineup.So the business has done quite well over the last handful of quarters. And this is a real opportunity, Ithink, for the company to press forward in a most aggressively, as Elon has mentioned.Elon R.

We do not particularly constrainourselves. We don't particularly integrate just for the hell of particularly integrating. Like if there's agreat supplier who's better than us or we think at least very good, or even where the economics arecomparative advantage suggests that we should use that supplier, even if we could beat them, butwe could use our resources to do something else that will be more productive, then we would in-source in that case. But if we have to go mine, we will mine.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDElon, my follow-up is 1 terawatt hour of manufacturing in the United States, vertically integrated. Iguess my question is what would need to change with U.S. permitting laws to allow that? Kind ofwhat would be your message to this administration or next?

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, I mean, I think the message to the government would be that there should be -- I should say,we've actually had conversations with a number of senior government leaders, White House,Congress and whatnot. And the suggestion that we have is that there should be an expeditedpermitting process for anything which is critical to a sustainable energy future.So it doesn't make sense to put like a coal mine and a sustainable energy battery like lithium mine inthe same category. Coal is not in the future, lithium does. And by the way, you can extract lithiumwith almost no disturbance to the local environment. So it's not actually ugly, nasty miningsituation.So I would recommend, expedited permitting would really be helpful.

We sure look at the front windshield.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. And so what -- at least of what we know so far, so peak on the commodity side in Q3, I saypeak, hopefully, it stays the peak, hopefully, it starts to come down. There is a small amount ofproduction that we're seeing going into our Q4 cost structure from steel and aluminum primarily,but it's less than 10% of the total increases we've seen so far.So we're optimistic here based upon what we're seeing on the indexes for some of our coststructure.

And that sort of leaning out of yields, the ï¬?nal cycle time to achieve target. You mentionedlogistics, it's not something that we're speciï¬?cally focused on, I guess, but eventually could be aproblem as we're talking about hundreds of gigawatt hours at different sites across the UnitedStates.But I would never sit here and say we have no challenges remaining.

2022/10/19,"Okay. And the last question comes from William Stein from Truist.William Stein - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MDI guess I'll go at one that I asked last time, Elon, which is your expectation for the likelihood ofcommercial success in each of the 3 major AI endeavors, FSD sort of as imagined without a driver,the training computer and, of course, Optimus.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe'll achieve full self-driving full time probability of that occurring is 100%. And I think we'll --we're almost there.

2023/1/25,"I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhornand a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Timein the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent ï¬?lings with the SEC. (Operator Instructions)But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you, Martin. So '22 -- just going through the '22 recap. It was a fantastic year for Tesla. Itwas our best year ever on every level. Team did an amazing job. It's an honor, of course, to workwith such an incredibly talented group of people.So in 2022, we delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highestamong any volume carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker. While doing so, we generated$12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash ï¬?ow. Importantly, the Tesla team achievedthese records while -- despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forcedshutdowns, very high interest rates and many delivery challenges. So it's worth noting that all theserecords were in the face of massive difï¬?culties. Credit to the team for achieving that.The most common question we've been getting from investors is about demand. Thus far -- so Iwant to put that concern to rest. Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-datethan ever in our history. We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production. So Imean that -- it's hard to say whether that will continue twice the rate of production, but the ordersare high. And we've actually raised the Model Y price a little bit in response to that.So we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as awhole. So basically, price really matters. I think there's just a vast number of people that want tobuy a Tesla car but can't afford it. And so these price changes really make a difference for theaverage consumer. And sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money,they sort of forget about how important affordability is.","During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements.

2023/1/25,"And it's always been our goal at Tesla tomake cars that are affordable to as many people as possible so I'm glad that we're able to do so. Andyes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered. We're also making very good progress on costcontrol. And we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with thegrowth in production, as you'd expect, so yes.With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed Full Self-Driving Beta to -- for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America. This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Betais the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy. And we'recurrently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways. And our published data showsthat improvement in safety -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear. So we would not havereleased the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent.Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year,and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at GigaNevada yesterday. Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cellsproduced internally and continue to use the self cell providers. So to be clear, we will continue touse other cell providers. Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-inï¬?nite and will befor quite some time. So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internallyproduced cells. And we've got an amazing plan for making the 4680 cell low cost and high energydensity.So energy storage also saw record growth, and that is continuing to accelerate. That's always worthremembering that the 3 pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric vehicles, solarand wind, and the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind,because obviously, the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. So youhave those 3 things. You can convert all of earth to a fully sustainable situation many times over,actually.So I would like to just make it clear that there is a path to a fully sustainable future for humanity,and we -- our goal at Tesla is to accelerate progress on that path as much as humanly possible.

Additionally, we continued tomake progress on overhead efï¬?ciencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue improvedfurther.For Q4 speciï¬?cally, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions as we aremanaging through COVID impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S.and a rising interest rate environment. Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectivelyincreased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly 10%.Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by 3 factors:ï¬?rst is raw materials and inï¬?ation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls;second, we are working through the early ramp of inefï¬?ciencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell production factories; third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavilytowards Model Y , which carries a slight cost premium to Model 3.Partially offsetting these impacts, we've continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions,in line with the progress we've made in prior years. These improvements include our continuedwork to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles.

While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on agood trajectory.As we look towards 2023, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost.There are 3 key points I wanted to make here. First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customerinterest in our products remains high. Second, on cost reduction, we're holding steady on our plansto rapidly increase volume while improving overhead efï¬?ciency, which is the most effective methodto retain strength in our operating margins.In particular, we're accelerating improvements in our new factories in Austin, Berlin and in-housecells, where inefï¬?ciencies are the highest. But we are attacking every other area of cost andunwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability.

We've answered that one aswell.So let's go to the next one. The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage ofadvanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells/packs, so $3,700 per long-range Model3 and Model Y , it's $45 a kilowatt-hour, for autos and energy products? And how much does Teslaexpect to earn in the coming year from these credits?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some. Long term, we expect these -- the valueof these credits to be very signiï¬?cant. You can do the math. If we were to get anywhere near 1,000gigawatt-hours of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very signiï¬?cant. So -- butthe credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing. And in the case of Panasonic domesticmanufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits. So it will -- the value of credits this year willnot be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic. We think it probably will be very signiï¬?cant in thefuture.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we're expecting in terms of impact to Tesla forthis year. So different products, we think, will get different amounts of credit. The regulations hereare still in ï¬?ux and there continues to be updates, so this is just our best understanding at themoment. But we think on the order of $150 million to $250 million per quarter this year andgrowing over the course of the year as our volumes grow.And part of the work we're doing here, which is part of what this incentive package is trying toincentivize, is, as Elon mentioned, to move more manufacturing onshore in the United States, whichis Tesla's plans anyways. And so I think we're pretty well positioned over the coming years to takeadvantage of this.But then also part of what the goal of this incentive package is, is to improve adoption from ourcustomers.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, go ahead, Zach.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes, I'll jump in on this. So there is certainly a lot of uncertainty about how the year will unfold, butI'll share what's in our current forecast for a moment. So based upon these metrics here, we believethat we'll be above both of the metrics that are stated in the question, so 20% automotive grossmargin, excluding leases and credits, and then $47,000 ASP across all models.And so 2 other comments I want to make on this, just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4to Q1. And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in conï¬?guratorprices. As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we're delivering cars to at a lower price book giventhat backlogs had been so long for so much of 2022. But then also, there are various programs inplace that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs.The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we're most focusedon what our operating margin is. And so as other areas of the business become more important,particularly the energy business, which is growing faster than the vehicle business, and as we'reheavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efï¬?ciency of our overheads, we think theright metric for us to be focused on is operating margin. And so I wanted to make sure that I sharedthat with the investor community as well because that is what we're primarily managing to now.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand but I think a lot ofothers maybe don't is that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploadingsoftware, to have full self-driving enabled, and full self-driving is obviously getting better veryrapidly. So that's actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a fewexceptions -- I mean only a small percentage of cars don't have Hardware 3.So that means that there's millions of cars where full self-driving can be sold at essentially 100%gross margin.","Elon R.

Do you expect there to be an upgrade path forHardware 3 cars to Hardware 4?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, Cybertruck will have Hardware 4.

I think it's probably going to take some time before this business is large enough for speciï¬?cï¬?nancial disclosures. But I'm happy to provide an update on where we stand in the business. Sowe're currently at a $300 million annual premium run rate as of the end of last year. We're growing20% a quarter so it's growing faster than the growth in our vehicle business.And in the states in which we're operating, on average, 17% of the customers in the states are usinga Tesla Insurance product. And that number continues to tick up as we spend more time in markets.And we see most of the adoption occurring when folks take delivery of a new car, as they're settingup insurance for the ï¬?rst time as opposed to going back and switching when they already haveinsurance set up. So there's an inherent stickiness in the Insurance business.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorNo, go ahead.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFONo, I was just going to say, just as a broader reminder on kind of the motivation for starting thisbusiness, it was to improve and still is to improve the total cost of ownership of our cars, given thatwe're seeing high premiums of insurance from third-party companies. And that remains our priorityhere. We'll obviously run this as a healthy business, but we want to make sure we keep our costslow and insurance stays affordable to our customers.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. And so there are 2 really important side beneï¬?t to our Tesla Insurance that are worthmentioning, one of which Zach alluded to, which is that just by Tesla operating insurance for ourcars at a competitive rate, that makes the other car insurance companies offer better rates for Teslas.So it has a bigger effect than you think because it improves total cost -- or insurance costs evenwhen they don't use Tesla Insurance, because now the [gigas] of the world have to compete withTesla and cannot charge outrageous insurance for Teslas.

2023/1/25,"So it has an ampliï¬?ed effect,very important.Then it is also giving us a good feedback loop into minimizing the cost of repair of Teslas for allTeslas worldwide, because we obviously want to minimize the cost of repairing a Tesla if it's in acollision and for Tesla Insurance. And previously, we didn't actually have good insight into thatbecause the other insurance companies would cover the cost. And actually, the cost, in some cases,were unreasonably high.So we've actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car tominimize the cost of repair, obviously minimize -- ï¬?rst, the best repair is no repair, avoid theaccident entirely, which since every Tesla comes with the most advanced active safety in the world,whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the intelligence of full self-driving for activesafety, active collision prevention. So it's giving us this really good feedback for, again, reducingcost -- total cost of ownership and also just ï¬?guring out how to get -- if somebody's car is in anaccident -- most accidents are actually small. They're like a broken fender or scratched side of thecar or something like, the vast majority of accidents.But we're actually solving how to get somebody's car repaired very quickly and efï¬?ciently and backin their hands. And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars. And we'remaking -- just to emphasize another key point because some of these points might be [less], so Iapologize for being repetitive.But it's remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviouslyimproving the logistics of spare part -- providing spare parts needed for collision repair have anenormous effect on the repair cost. So if you're waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takesa month, now you've got a month of having to rent another car. It's extremely expensive.

We're doing a lot of work on costreduction outside of that. And we talked about supply chain costs, expedites, logistics, attackingeverything.On the raw materials and inï¬?ation side, where lithium is the large driver there and this was ameaningful source of cost increase for us, we'll have to see where lithium prices go. And we're notfully exposed to lithium prices, but I think in general, as what we've seen from our forecast here,cost per car of lithium in 2023 will be higher than 2022. So that's a headwind that would have to beovercome to return back to those levels. So I don't think we'll get there this year, but I think we'llmake progress. And we'll continue to ï¬?nd ways to offset these raw material costs that we don't havecontrol over.(inaudible), is there anything on that?Unidentiï¬?ed Company Representative -Yes. Like on the non-cells raw material, we begin to capture beneï¬?ts of indexes tapering out, butdue to the length of various supply chains, it does take time before this is reï¬?ected in our ï¬?nancials.And while aluminum is down like 20% year-over-year, steel is about 30% down year-over-year, theglobal non-cells raw materials market continues to be inï¬?uenced by geopolitical situations inEurope, high production cost due to labor cost increases and energy spikes and disruptions due tonatural disasters like typhoon in Korea 4 months ago, pandemic lockdowns.So we believe that meaningful price corrections will ultimately come, but it remains uncertainexactly when.","Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOThe Austin and Berlin ramp inefï¬?ciencies in 4680 will make a substantial amount of progress onthat over the course of the year, and that's within Tesla's control.

So over the course of 2023, on the powertrain side, we're actually goingto go after sort of some materials where we're paying for more performance than we need or wehave more content than we need without impacting reliability at all. And that will actually add up toa pretty signiï¬?cant cost reduction on the powertrain side over the course of 2023. So we're not justsort of relying on supply.

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureSo as a quick follow-up, Elon, I was thinking about like FSD, and when you look at like thesituation today compared to a year ago, it's -- like the progress has been like amazing in the qualityof the product but also its rollout. And so I was wondering, how much is this like impacting the takerate of FSD today? So do you already see that people are getting more excited by FSD because theysee it around them on 400,000 cars and they see the value of the service already? Or is that too earlyto really see like -- to expect like an uptick in the take rate?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThe trend is very strong towards use of FSD.

This is, I guess, for Zach. Obviously, you unlocked some deferred revenue inthe quarter that will translate presumably into higher margins on every incremental sale goingforward so long as people opt in for FSD.

Great. And then maybe 1 additional question here on the incremental capacity in Nevada, the4680s that you're planning. It's a lot of batteries, basically, and presumably, you won't be putting allof those in Tesla Semi.

It's doing crypto mining. It's doing alot of things.Dojo is just doing 1 thing, and that is training. And we're also optimizing the low-level software. Soit -- at a very sort of fair amount of level.

I feel we're in a very strong position to getthrough a recession because we really don't have any debt, and we've got over $20 billion of cash,which is great.

Our Q1 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Timein the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has someopening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you, Martin. So just a Q1 recap. Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind inEurope and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United States. And this is in spite of a lot ofchallenges in production and delivery, so it's a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving thesegreat results. The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain. Idon't think I'm telling anyone anything people don't already know, especially with large purchasessuch as cars.And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it's worth noting that our operating marginremains among the best in the industry. We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and alarger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin. However, we expectour vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy. So we dobelieve we're like laying the groundwork here, and that it's better to ship a large number of cars at alower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy. This isan extremely important point.Let's see. Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on ourpilot line for testing purposes. It's a great product, and we're completing the installation of thevolume production line at Giga Texas, and we're anticipating having delivery event, a great deliveryevent probably in Q3.As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and thenaccelerates. So the Cybertruck is no different. So it's -- there's tremendous amount of demand forthe product, obviously.","Elon Musk: Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind inEurope.

2023/4/19,"And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer. But as with all newproducts, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going. And this is, really, a very radicalproduct. It's not made in the way that other cars are made.So let's see, with regards to Megapack, we're making great progress. Our energy storagedeployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1. This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever. Andthis growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Megafactory in Lathrop, California. There's still some way to go to reach the full run rates of 40 gigawatt hours per year. And then weadditionally announced the start of a new Megafactory in Shanghai. So we're -- as we've expected,the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth.Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. We've now crossed over 150 million miles driven byFull Self-Driving beta, and this number is growing exponentially. We're -- I mean, this is a dataadvantage that really no one else has. Those who understand AI will understand the importance ofdata -- of training data and how fundamental that is to achieving an incredible outcome.So yes, so we're also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of themain limiting factors of achieving full autonomy. So we're continuing to simultaneously makesignificant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort into Dojo, which we believehas the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training. And it also -- Dojoalso has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in thesame way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore.So I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant.In conclusion, we're taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can.Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further,and we'll continue to invest in growth as fast as possible. Once again, I'd like to give a huge thanksto all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again. And yes, superappreciated.","Our energy storagedeployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1. This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever.

2023/4/19,"Thank you very much. And Zach has some remarks as well.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOThanks, Martin. I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production anddeliveries. And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well.There are 3 main points I want to make. First, automotive gross margin and operating marginreduced sequentially. But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels. In particular,automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earningscall, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehiclepricing and onetime items, most notably, warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well asincreased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot features as we transition technologies.Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics andthe beginnings of some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized. Per unit cost for Austinand Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes. However, these factories still provide amargin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and stabilize at our intendedvolumes.Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balancedmix of build and deliveries. As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries andproduction within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter andhas an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows. This was particularly prevalent in Q1for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries.Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years ofinvestment and focus. This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company'srevenue and reached its highest level yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for ourMegapack products. We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highestgross profit yet in the quarter.Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we're operating the business this year. Ourapproach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses. Weplan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, in-house cell production, energy storage business and our Autonomy and AI-enabled products.","Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOThanks, Martin.

2023/4/19,"Thank you. The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto? Andwhen will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, I should just clarify, like, bigger than auto from the standpoint of, like, total gigawatt hoursdeployed. So it's possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours, I think, will beprobably higher with stationary storage. If you just look at the -- what's needed to transition theworld to a sustainable energy economy, there is more stationary energy storage needed than there ismobile energy storage. So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess ofautomotive, so that is in line with expectations.Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with thenext question, which is on guidance for margins, just have a single comment there. I think we are --we will get to the point where we, as a company, provide guidance on the storage business.I say storage as a combination of both the Megapack business and the Powerwall business. Relativeto total revenues of the company, it's still fairly small. And the business has a lot of volatilitycurrently, both in terms of volumes as well as financials, just given the small volumes and kind ofdiversification of the customer pool there.But as this business grows and smooths out, I don't think we're that far away from it. I thinkincluding these volumes on our day 2 production and deliveries release is something that we'll startdoing and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the comingyear. I think it'll be a few more quarters before we get there.","The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto?

Just one other thing I wanted to mention on margin. While we're not providing specificguidance there, I mean, just to set expectations of where we think this business will go in terms ofmargins, probably generally in the ballpark of what we've seen historically on the vehicle business.We generally look to mid-20% gross margins for any program that we launch. And so we're notthere yet on this business, but that's what we're working towards.Elon R.

2023/4/19,"Thank you. The next question is, how well are 4680 cells meeting the expectations described on theBattery Day? How long will it be until the cells meet those goals? Drew?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. So on Battery Day, we established a cost-down roadmap through 2026 across 5 areas of effort.There was the cell design we discussed, anode and cathode materials, the structural pack conceptand the cell factory itself, and we've been making progress across all of these aspects since then.For the cell factory, the Texas 4680 factory, we are partway through building and commissioningand selling and operating, will be 70% lower CapEx per gigawatt hour than typical cell factorieswhen fully ramped, in line with what we described on Battery Day. And we're continuing to furtherpursue densification and investment reduction opportunities in future factory build-outs like inNevada. On the cell design, we're in production with not only the first generation tabless cell weunveiled in Battery Day, but a second more manufacturer version in Texas today.On the cathode materials side, we have a number of activities underway per the Battery Dayroadmap. For lithium, our Corpus Christi Lithium refinery breaks ground this May. Our goal is tostart commissioning portions of the facility before the end of the year. The refinery uses the sulfate-free spodumene refining process with reduced process costs, no acid or caustic reagents, lowerembodied energy. It actually produces a beneficial byproduct that can be repurposed in constructionmaterials. We discussed all of these concepts on Battery Day.Same with cathode precursor, we've successfully demonstrated lower process cost, zero-waste waterprecursor process that we described on Battery Day at both lab and pilot scale and are in thedetailed design phase for incorporating this technology into the front end of our Austin cathodefacility.On cathode production, we are 50% equipment and 75% utilities installed at our new cathodebuilding in Austin with our goal to begin dry and wet commissioning this quarter and next quarterwith a target to produce first material before the end of the year.Structural pack, we saw big improvements with pack manufacturing with the 4680 cell and thestructural pack concept, 50% lower CapEx and 66% smaller factory for the same output in gigawatthours per year. We do believe structural as a concept is a good one. It's simpler.","On Battery Day, we established a cost-down roadmap through 2026 across 5 areas of effort.

2023/4/19,"We'll continue tostructurally load the cells and use the pack as the floor of the vehicle while iterating the design tocloser to B-level execution of this A-level architecture in future programs.And zooming out for the 4680 team, Q1 was all about cost and quality. We made significantimprovements in both areas. Texas production increased 50% quarter-over-quarter through yields,increased 12%; in Kato peak rate increased by 20%; and through yields improved by 20%.Altogether, the team accomplished a 25% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on trackto achieve steady-state cost targets over the next 12 months. And going forward for the rest of theyear, the priority one is yield in cost for the 4680 program as we steadily ramp production ahead ofCybertruck next year.","Texas production increased 50% quarter-over-quarter through yields,increased 12%; in Kato peak rate increased by 20%; and through yields improved by 20%.Altogether, the team accomplished a 25% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on trackto achieve steady-state cost targets over the next 12 months.

2023/4/19,"Thank you very much. The next question is, what do you anticipate 2023 automotive gross marginsex credits will be at the company's current pricing levels?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes, I can start off on this one. This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this. There'sa lot of macro uncertainty. There are also headwinds and tailwinds. And this is basically a question,I think, that's asking about viewpoint and where costs will go. And within costs, there's a set ofcosts in which we do control the set of costs in which we're kind of subject to what's going on in themacro world.Within the bucket of things we control, the most of the cost down that we're working on is aroundramping our Austin factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we getto our intended volumes there. And a part of the cost journey in the Austin factory is, as Drewmentioned, the 4680 cells, which is an input into our Austin COGS. And so as the 4680 programimproves over the course of the year on cost, as Drew mentioned, and then the noncell portion ofthe factory improves, we see a pretty good trajectory in the Austin facility.A similar story exists in the Berlin factory. It does not have 4680 as an input, but for that factory, thejourney to complete localization is still ongoing. And so over the course of this year, as volumeincreases, more localization occurs, we do see a good path to cost reduction in the Berlin factory aswell. In existing factories, too, we talk about this on every call, so I don't need to rehash it, but theexpectation is that every existing factory improves all of their key metrics, and we continue to seethe progress there.There's also a handful of other costs in which we have influence, but the philosophy here is thatwe're aggressively going across every cost bucket that we can.","The most of the cost down that we're working on is aroundramping our Austin factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we getto our intended volumes there.

So first question was on Lathrop. Obviously, that's -- it's great to see the growththere. Just wondering when you think that facility might be closer to full utilization? Are you justsort of deliberately working your way up the S curve there? Demand, obviously, isn't the limitation.So what are what are the steps, I guess, to unlocking full utilization there?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSure. There are some classic factory ramp aspects of what's going on in Lathrop. We actually had 2phases of the CapEx there, replaced some of the general assembly parts of the facility. But inaddition, we also have ramps with our suppliers that we are following, so both on the sell side andon the power electronics side. And we will see that unlock in the latter half of this year with -- aswell as those inputs. So the overall facility was phased with the second phase of CapEx coming upon towards the end of this year.Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Sandler & Co., Research Division - MD & Senior ResearchAnalystOkay. Great. And then I guess my second question is on your ability to serve other markets out ofShanghai. Obviously, the facility in Berlin should be opening up your ability to, I guess, allocatemore vehicles to Southeast Asia, Australia, other areas.

2023/4/19,"Okay. Thank you very much. Let's go to the next analyst, George from Canaccord.George Gianarikas - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - AnalystI was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you've seen anysignificant positive or negative change there? And also, given that you've reduced the prices foryour vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, to kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it's a tricky pricing questionbecause the value of a car that is autonomous is enormous. So in a way, the price right now is anoption value on an autonomous vehicle. And that value is -- will ultimately be very significant. Andit's really -- yes, I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I mean, you can see theimprovements are really quite dramatic. There'll be a little bit of 2 steps forward, 1 step backbetween releases for those trying the beta. But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving,towards full autonomy.

And I hesitate to say this, but I think we'll do it this year. So that's what itlooks like, yes.George Gianarikas - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - AnalystMaybe on the dramatic change we've seen in EV-related commodity prices. Do you think it's areflection of any recent overcapacity in mining and refining? Or is that sort of a coincident indicatoron global EV demand? And how do you expect those prices to track over the next severalquarters? Elon Musk: I wish I had a crystal ball to answer your question.",,
2023/4/19,"- SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringThe only thing I would say on the, like, EV materials markets. They're not all super liquid and someof them, for example, like, less than -- like, single-digit percentage of the market is actually tradedon the spot market. And not only are they not super liquid, there's not -- like, storage isn'tparticularly facile for all of materials. So, like, small mismatches in supply and demand drive, likelarge price swings, not really -- real price swings, but just like temporarily large price swings. So it'shard to read into those price wings. I don't know, Karn, if you want to add anything.Karn Budhiraj -Yes. Well, this is Karn, by the way. We are seeing, as Elon mentioned, quite a bit of softening in thelithium carbonate market. This was -- 6 months ago, we were trading at like $85,000 a ton, andtoday's spot price is about 26%. So there's been a dramatic decrease in that. Of course, we were ableto take advantage of low lithium pricing earlier on with fixed-price contracts. And we find that thisis going to be another opportunity -- opportune moment to basically extend that into the later half ofthe decade.But we -- at the quantities we're procuring, we're not as impacted by the spot market because wehave all those contracts in place, and we're just going to be going and doing more of that. The otherthing that's happening is because of the price spike. A lot of the companies that are in this businessare becoming more ambitious about finding more upstream resources and exploring locations inAfrica as well as South America. So that's also helping the macro situation with pricing.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. But just on the lithium front, to emphasize, the choke point is more -- much more on refiningcapacity than it is on mining. Lithium is actually -- is very common throughout the world, includingin the U.S. and, really, it's just a very common element on earth. It's lithium. So it's much more aquestion of where is the refining capacity and can the refining capacity keep up. That's really whatmatters more than where is the lithium ore. It's everywhere basically.I think that same question also extends to refining of the cathode, and to some degree, refining ofthe anode.","Elon R.

2023/4/19,"And this is why we -- at Tesla, we're building our lithium refinery capability at CorpusChristi and our cathode refinery outside Austin.It's worth noting, like, I hope other companies do the same thing. We will have, by far, the mostlithium refining capability and the most cathode refining capability in North America, I think,probably more than everyone else combined by a lot. So can other people please do those work?That would be great. We're begging you. We don't want to do it. Can someone please?

2023/4/19,"Yes, we can. Yes.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystMaybe a first question for Elon, on your pricing strategy. So if I understand your message, you'resaying Tesla feels it's worth maximizing the volume, increasing the size of the fleet as fast as youcan because you'll be able to monetize this over the life cycle of the vehicle. Could you be a littlebit more specific around ways you would be able to monetize sort of, like, this existing fleet in thefuture? Obviously, I think Autonomous seems to be a big piece of it, but my understanding was thatrobotaxi would probably be for the next-generation vehicle, not the existing one? So I guess inwhich ways would you monetize it?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorSorry, the robotaxi terminology can be a bit confusing, because that's sort of like a generic term forour next-generation vehicle. And we obviously are working on next-generation vehicle. That'sgoing to be very compelling. This is just not the time to talk about it in details, the product. So weinternally call it robotaxi.But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware 3, which is the vast majority of our fleet, webelieve will achieve full autonomy. So there will be a -- like, a Model 3 or Model Y would be arobotaxi, a robotic taxi. So yes, that's -- to the best of my knowledge that -- we believe the currenthardware can achieve full autonomy.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystUnderstood. And then maybe a question for Zach. Back on the automotive gross margins. So Ithink, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that 20%automotive gross margin was still probably a reasonable floor.Obviously, the macro has gone worse and additional price cuts have happened. Is there anythingelse that has changed in terms of the outlook? Is it just the macro deteriorating? Is it the competitivelandscape? Anything else that's sort of, like, makes you think differently around the full year? Andis there a way, therefore, to frame a floor?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes. About half of the miss against that previous conversation last quarter is attributed toadjustments we made in pricing in the second half of the quarter.","Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystMaybe a first question for Elon, on your pricing strategy.

2023/4/19,"I mean, I guess you could arguethat, that lowers the floor in a sense. We've also made pricing adjustments so far this quarter. So thatbrings it down further.About the other half of the miss in Q1 was attributed to things that are nonrecurring. So I mentionedthese in my opening remarks. It's a warranty adjustment for cars that were previously produced butnot part of the pedigree of cars we're building now and some autopilot-related deferrals as we makesome technology changes here that this deferral should get recognized once some of the softwarecatches up. So those 2 things are nonrepeating. So hopefully, that helps answer your question.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, there are really 2 macro factors that are tricky, the biggest being the interest rate. So ifthere's a very high Fed rate or interest rates are very high, that -- that is -- every time the Fed raisesthe interest rates, that's equivalent to increasing the price of a car. It makes the cars less affordablebecause people are able to buy cars as a function of what they can afford on a monthly basis. Sothat's -- so it's just almost directly equivalent to a price increase is any kind of interest rate increase.Then the other factor is whenever there is uncertainty in the economy, people will generallypostpone new -- big, new capital purchases like a new car. This is natural human reaction. So ifpeople are reading about layoffs and whatnot in the press, they're like, well, they might be worriedabout -- they might be laid off. So then they'll be, naturally, a little more hesitant than they wouldotherwise be to buy a new car. Now this is just the nature of the auto industry. But there is -- therewill be a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for new cars, so -- but it goes through cycles.","Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorNo, it's really just like -- every day, we get a daily real-time update of how many cars were orderedyesterday, how many cars were produced yesterday. We must have -- if there's a company that's gotmore real-time data than Tesla -- I'm not sure there's any company on earth that has better real-timedata than Tesla, except maybe SpaceX Starlink.So -- because, like, we don't have to -- for the other car companies, they will make the cars, sendthem to the dealers, then the dealers will sell the cars. And then it takes quite a long time for themto get the data back to actually figure out how many cars were sold. Whereas we know how manycars were ordered yesterday throughout the world. So our fingers on the pulse is real-time and doesnot have latency, whereas the other car companies have a lot of latency in their data.As does the government, the government has a lot of latency in the data. So we're just looking at itand saying, okay, what does it take to achieve a clearing price for our vehicle production? And thenwe'll make a pricing change, and we see what happens immediately and adjust course.So we're adjusting course and we're thinking about it literally every day, 7 days a week.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, I think -- again, would really love to have a crystal ball here, but we don't have it. Dependingon what time scale you're looking at, most of the cars are variable -- so -- most of the car cost isvariable. So -- and probably, if I were to guess, I think we will see improved costs from suppliers.Yes, I think we will -- that is our expectation.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringAnd we're already starting to see that, Elon, I think you had mentioned before that we anticipated acrash in the lithium prices and some of that has flowed through by way of lithium carbonatereductions into battery cost. And the same thing will happen with lithium hydroxide. The length ofthe supply chain matters also because what we're talking about is very far upstream.So by the time it makes its way into the battery that slip in a car, it'll be several months. But beyondjust commodity pricing, as Zach mentioned earlier, we're also very focused on other metrics thatmake production very efficient. So for example, detention and demurrage, error expedites. I thinkour error expedites are down 90%. Detention and demurrage is down 93% from the peaks. That canbe hundreds of thousands of dollars per vehicle.

I think we've been able to balance it rather well. For example, inEurope, 50% of all of our supercharging stations are open to all EVs, and we've been able to do thatwithout any increase in wait times at all for anybody.

Let's go to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystI just wanted to, first, just follow up on your comments in your letter about leveraging your costposition as others struggle with unit economics and also taking into account the lifetime revenue,actually in a way that most other automakers will never see just given your service network andsupercharging and other attributes.Can you just maybe give us a sense of how far you'd be willing to take this?

And again, any color that youmight provide on the updated range of margins that you'd expect in the auto business?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think we may have answered this question or tried to answer this question a few times. But it'sdifficult to say what the margin will be. It depends on what the macroeconomic environment is like.So for example, if the Fed were to lower the rates, that would be super helpful for demand. If theyraise them, that just raises the interest costs that buyers have to pay for to buy a car. So it reducesaffordability and therefore, reduces demand.So it's -- but if -- like, if we look past, say, this year or, like, go sometime next year, middle of nextyear, so I think things are looking really -- I think, like I said, we'll weather through if there aresome major geopolitical wildcard that turns up.

Just based on your pulse taking of the consumer, do you have a view onelasticity of demand?Elon Musk: I can't emphasize enough the whole -- just fundamental question of affordability. For mostpeople, their ability to buy a car is a function of can they make monthly payment or not. So it's -- I think probably banks are not leaning forward in providing loans, I expect,these days.",,

And you'll notethat back in 1913, Henry Ford introduced the moving assembly line in Highland Park, Michigan.And the price of a Model T, which had already been undercutting cars around the time, fell another70% or 80%, and hundreds of rival car companies went bust. I'm wondering, if history is repeatingitself here, Elon, and that the recent pattern of cuts with you is way ahead of the cost curvecompared to competition, is this -- it seems like it's a calculated strategy, not just in reaction tocompetition or changing supply-demand in the market, but your -- could we catalyze someDarwinian forces in the EV market?Elon R.

And our final question comes from Philippe Houchois from Jefferies.Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Automotive AnalystIt's slightly longer term. I completely agree with your comments that we should look at Tesla interms of auto market share and not EV market share. But I'm just wondering, as you build up themarket share globally, is there a limit to the direct selling business model as you practice it? Andshould we think about -- going forward, you need to look into the agency or using importers tobasically develop market share more smoothly, I guess, globally?

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIt seems to be working well so far.Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Automotive AnalystBecause we hear different feedback from customers who miss the human interaction or unhappywith the service, and I'm just wondering if you're seeing some growth pains in there that would leadyou to change. You're not seeing that?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, I mean, there are -- since we're always going to have some growing pains where at times --and it depends on which geography we're talking about where sometimes service is behind sales,sometimes it's ahead of sales. This is -- I mean Tesla's growing, I believe, faster than any companyin history that makes a large complex manufactured object.So these are -- as you try to max -- it's always difficult to match exponentials. So -- but I think it ishelpful to have the feedback loop with a service, because that means we feel the pain of service, andthen we can adjust the design to make the car need less service. And I think that gives us the rightincentive structure, like, because the best service is no service. The car doesn't break.And whereas if you have, say, a dealer network that is reliant upon services revenue, then youarguably have a misalignment of incentives where they're making money on service. But actually,we want to -- the best thing for the consumer is the car doesn't need servicing, so.Philippe Jean Houchois - Jefferies LLC, Research Division - MD & Senior Automotive AnalystYes.

Actually, this one -- assuming I could wax on about for a while, because, really, people didn'tunderstand that the best short-selling argument against Tesla for the longest time was the fact thatTesla does not have an existing fleet and that the auto industry, the reason incumbents succeed andnewcomers fail, the biggest reason is that the incumbents have a large fleet, and they're able to sellnew cars at close to 0 margin and then sell spare parts at a very high margin, sort of razors andblades type thing.And so the only way to actually succeed, for a newcomer to succeed is to have a product that is socompelling that people are willing to pay a premium over the incumbent product.

2023/7/19,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast. My nameis Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhornand a number of other executives.Our Q2 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time, and the update deck, we published atthe same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you, Martin. So just a Q2 recap. In Q2, we achieved record vehicle production and deliveriesand record revenue of about $25 billion in a single quarter. And Model Y became the best-sellingvehicle of any kind globally in Q1, surpassing the likes of Corolla and Golf. So it was the #1vehicle of any kind, including vehicles that are sold at a far lower price. This was, I think, anincredible achievement by the Tesla team, and just a huge thank you to our customers for theirsupport.And this came in spite of high interest rates and a lot of macro uncertainty. And nonetheless, wemanaged to achieve operating margin of about 10%. We continue to target 1.8 million vehicledeliveries this year, although we expect that Q3 production will be a little bit down because we'vegot summer shutdowns for a lot of factory upgrades, so just probably a slight decrease in productionin Q3 for sort of global factory upgrades.And the long-term economy we think is going to just drive volume through the ceiling, next level.And our sort of future robotaxi products, the dedicated robotaxi products, we think have a quasi-infinite demand. The way we're going to manufacture the robotaxi is also itself a revolution. And soit's a revolutionary sign made in a revolutionary way. It will be, by far, the highest units per hour ofany vehicle production ever. And I'm so very excited about that.With respect to Autopilot and Dojo, in order to build autonomy, we also need to train our neural netwith data from millions of vehicles.","Tesla's Q2 results were announced at about 3 p.m. Central Time, and the update deck, we published atthe same link as this webcast.

2023/7/19,"The more -- I mean, this has been proven over and over again,the more training data you have, the better the results. And I mean, there are times where we seebasically, in a neural net basically, it's sort of, at a million training examples, it barely works at 2million, it slightly works at 3 million. It's like, ""Wow, okay, we're seeing something."" But then youget to like 10 million training examples, it's like -- it becomes incredible. So there's just nosubstitute for a massive amount of data. And obviously, Tesla has more vehicles on the road that are collecting this data than all other companies combined by, I think, maybe even an order ofmagnitude. So I think we might have 90% of all -- a very big number.So the success in AI and dev is a function of talent, sort of unique data and computing resources.And we have outstanding capabilities in all 3 arenas. And I really just don't know how anyone coulddo what we're doing, even if they had our software and had our computer, if they did not have thetraining data.So speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost ofneural net training. It is designed to -- it's somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need,which is a video training. So we just see that the need for neural net training, again, talking of beinga quasi-infinite of things, is just enormous. So I think having -- we expect to use both NVIDIA andDojo, to be clear. But there's -- we just see a demand for really advanced training resources. And wethink we may reach in-house neural net training capability of 100 [exoblocks] by the end of nextyear.So today, over 300 million miles have been driven using FSD Beta. That 300 million-mile numberis going to seem small very quickly. It will soon be billions of miles, tens of billions of miles. Andthe FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human. We see aclear path to full self-driving being 10x safer than the average human driver. And betweenAutopilot and Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of hardware 3,4. But it's really dedicated. It's a high-efficiency inference computer that's in the car.","The success in AI and dev is a function of talent, sort of unique data and computing resources.

2023/7/19,"And ourOptimus robot, Tesla's really at the cutting edge of AI development.With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build release candidates of the Cybertruck on ourfinal production line in Austin. I'm actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory. This is the first truckthat we're aware of that will have 4 doors over a 6-foot bed and will fit into a 20-foot garage. So it'sthe biggest on the outside, but it's even bigger on the inside. So I think that's -- one of the elementsof good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. And this is no smallcar, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last millimeter.So just trying to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small, and thenreally maximize the utility of the volume. And we can't wait to start delivering it later this year.Some other highlights. Our global Supercharging network now stands at over roughly 50,000connectors and over 5,000 locations. As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla chargingstandard, which we made open source, and it's now called the North American Charging Standard,we're deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use ourconnector and gain access to our charging network. We strongly believe in helping other carcompanies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right thing, in general. So that'sour goal there.Then I think what I want to emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point, is thatTesla, just as with the North American Charging Standard, although we're not licensing -- in thatcase not licensing, we're just making it available. But we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car companies. And we are already in discussions with --only just early discussions with a major OEM about using Tesla FSD. So we're not trying to keepthis to ourselves. We're more than happy to license it to others. And lastly, our new lithium refineryand cathode facility are progressing well.Now in conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can while maintaininghealthy financials.

Congratulationsagain to the Tesla team on the continued progress.As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility andconsumer confidence and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach.First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the coretechnologies that will drive the long-term value of the business. These include increasing spendingon AI-related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo; as well as new productssuch as Cybertruck, our next-generation platform, and the Semi, as evidenced by the continuedgrowth in our R&D spend. This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion notonly in our vehicle factories but also our supercharging network service, internal applications andbattery processes as we continue with meaningful capital expenditures to lay this foundation for thefuture.Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both our vehicle andenergy business but, most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue ourpace of R&D and capital investments. This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions ineach of our key businesses as well as working capital improvements on raw materials, work-in-process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2.If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction andremained healthy, despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter.We recognized -- we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, includingmaterial cost and commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidlyincrease the build rate in our Austin and Berlin factories. For our Energy business, we improvedmargins and gross profit driven by cost reductions in deal economics, particularly with Megapack.As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects andtheir specific revenue recognition milestones.As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon's comments on Q3 volumesdriven by planned downtimes for factory upgrades. These upgrades will also carry some amount offactory idle cost. However, we are working to minimize as much as possible.","Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOYes.

And let's go to investor questions. The first question on licensing FSD,we've already answered. So let's go to the second one. The second question is, what is the status of4680 cells? How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day? When do you expect toachieve what you laid out on Battery Day?Unidentified Company Representative -Yes. First, I'll just start with a little bit of a production update. So in Texas, 4680 cell productionincreased 80% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed 10 million production cells produced here inTexas. So congrats to the team for that. Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by 40% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a 25% reduction in cell COGS.Here in Texas, we're preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is 10% higher energy densitythan current production. That was accomplished through process and mechanical designoptimization. As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, weshould be in a comfortable place on cost per cell. Against our battery energy density targets, theCyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like electrochemistry basis. We're yet to integratesilicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring significantfurther energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day.Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on at Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment,factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texasscale-up to date.","In Texas, 4680 cell production increased 80% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed 10 million production cells produced here inTexas.

2023/7/19,"Thank you very much. The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energyproducts and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model? Given Tesla's AI capabilities,how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software margin fromAutobidder as this segment accelerates?Unidentified Company Representative -We can't comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update.Megapack continues to show strong demand globally, with Lathrop ramping successfully to meetour contracted projects in 2023. As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place,in line with our target market -- vehicle target margins.The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathropcapacity ahead of our full factory ramp in 2024. We have several exciting large projects inconstruction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, the Riverina project inAustralia, several projects in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we'll tour today,actually. We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with theseprojects.On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets likeAustralia, Texas, U.K. and California with over 6 gigawatt hours under Tesla's dispatch next year.In the U.K., our projects performed best in the industry in Q2. Autobidder does have softwaremargins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it's a relatively small contributor to revenues givenhow much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring. It's important toremember that this large project -- these large capital projects that have lifetimes of 20 years ofrecurring revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small.On the residential side, we have some fun things happening. We recently surpassed 0.5 millionPowerwalls installed. Just this week, we are launching Charge on Solar, which allows TeslaPowerwall and vehicle customers to charge their vehicles using their excess solar and drive only onthe sunshine that hits their roof. Yesterday, we began paying customers in Texas for participating inour virtual power plant to provide grid support to ERCOT. We expect these credits to lower ourmedian customer's annual bill by 1/3 and to increase these credits over time as ERCOT expandsmarket access.And today, we are expanding Tesla electric enrollment to new Model 3 owners in Texas, followedby all Texas vehicle customers over the rest of the quarter.","Megapack continues to show strong demand globally, with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet contracted projects in 2023.

On the first part of the question for IRA manufacturing incentives, weprovided previous guidance that we expect these to be, for the course of this year, in the range of$150 million to $250 million per quarter. We are staying within that foundry as we guidedpreviously, so that was the case in Q2 as well. I will note, and I think we've mentioned this before,that this includes a 50-50 sharing of credits for qualified cells from our long-term battery partner,Panasonic.On the commodity side, we are continuing to see improvements there, as we've discussedpreviously. Lithium is the most notable improvement so far. I think I commented on this on the lastcall because typically, we see this coming about a quarter before. It actually is realized in ourfinancials. And also just as a reminder, we're not fully exposed to the price of lithium. Our supplychain team has done a terrific job in partnership with another -- a bunch of other companies to putin place some long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up and down.We're also seeing benefits in aluminum and steel, which I think is great. Not as large as the lithiumimpacts, but they contribute nonetheless. So if we add up the total impact of this in Q2 relative toprior quarter, it's about the same size and magnitude as the IRA benefits that we also received.Just to put this in context, as you look at COGS per unit sequentially from Q1 to Q2, I think there's2 things to keep in mind there. The first is that our S/X mix for deliveries increased quite a bit fromQ1 to Q2. So as you think about fundamental cost reductions, it's important to adjust for that. Andthen secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin cost, which we did quite abit of that from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above Model Y production costselsewhere. And in the quarter, our mix of Austin- and Berlin-related builds increased.","The next question is, could you quantify the benefits to COGS per unit fromthe IRA battery manufacturing incentives; and secondly, battery raw material declines year-to-date?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOAll right.

As you mentioned, Zach, we've naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium positionbecause of the long-term contracts we have in place. But we have seen reduction in pricing acrossthe board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such as nickel, cobalt and graphite.And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact. We're taking advantage of the historically low commodity pricing in certain areas tokind of expand some of those fixed price contracts through the end of the decade.

Itdepends on how many are working and what phase. But it's sort of -- yes, there's more every month.There are a lot of interesting things about the Optimus bot.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, not a humanoid robot that can do something -- the things that a human could do. So we'veactually had to design our own actuators to integrate the motor, the power electronics, thecontroller, the sensors. And really, every one of them is custom designed. And then, of course, we'llbe using the same inference hardware as the car. But we, in designing these actuators, are designingthem for volume production, so that they're not just lighter, tighter and more capable than any otheractuators whereof that exists in the world. But it's also actually manufacturable. So we should beable to make them in volume. The first Optimus that is will have all of the Tesla designed actuators,sort of production candidate actuators, integrated and walking should be around November-ish. Andthen we'll start ramping up after that.In terms of when we'll be able to do some useful things, like we'll first be trying this out in our ownfactories and just proving out its utility, but I think we'll be able to have it do something useful inour factories sometime next year. I would be -- yes, I'm pretty confident of that. So yes, it's goingwell.I should say another cool thing about Optimus is that there's -- just in the U.S. alone, there are 2million amputees.

Conceptually, how does Tesladecide when is it appropriate to reduce prices or add other sales incentives to increase demand?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I guess demand has roughly tracked production, which is what we aim for, is we look at --something that we have that really, I think, no other carmaker has is that we have real-time demandand real-time production. Like, so 7 days a week, I get an e-mail -- order-generated e-mail whichshows output from all factories and orders globally. So it's like a real-time finger on the pulse ofearth basically. And we adjust course according to what the mood of the public is. Buying a new caris a big decision for a vast majority of people. So any time there's economic uncertainty, peoplegenerally pause on new car buying at least to see what happens.And then obviously, another challenge is the interest rate environment. As interest rates rise, theaffordability of anything bought with debt decreases, so effectively increasing the price of the car.So when interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car because theinterest payments increased the price of the car.

It's just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce thathas full autonomy capability as actually something that, in the future, may be worth as much as 5xwhat it is today.","Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOJust to add to what Elon mentioned, so the numbers that he mentioned are between R&D spend andcapital spend. And this is moving quickly. And so we provide a 3-year outlook on our capitalexpense. We are considering these expenses in that outlook. And as that moves up and down, we'llcontinue to update our guidance in the Q.Dan Meir Levy - Barclays Bank PLC, Research Division - Senior AnalystGreat. Just as a follow-up, I recognize there's sort of incredible macro uncertainty rightnow, but you're sticking with your near-term volume target of 50% CAGR. But to what extent are you willing to sacrifice onpricing to keep that 50% volume CAGr intact? Or are you thinking differently about margins?",,
2023/7/19,"Because average [pass-through] vehicle is doing like maybe 10 hours of driving aweek. If this is sort of -- if this says 1.5 hours a day on average, that's 10 hours a week-ish. If you'vegot on autonomous -- if that vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use -- so either dedicatedautonomous or partially autonomous, like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to beused by others, sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like doing Airbnb with a room in yourhouse, the value is just tremendous.So I think sort of it would be -- I think it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of makingmore vehicles because we think, in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuationincrease. I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point in which we can upload full self-drivingand is approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.","The average pass-through vehicle is doing like maybe 10 hours of driving aweek.

2023/7/19,"Thank you. Let's go to the next analyst. The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from DeutscheBank.Emmanuel Rosner - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division - Director & Research AnalystTwo questions from me as well. First, following up on the autonomy. So before you start launchingthese dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you're improving FSD incrementally. Whatis your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version thatwould trigger much higher take rates? And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of FSD?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWell, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me, and perhaps quite fairly have made fun ofme, my predictions about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past. The reasonI've been optimistic, what it tends to look like is we'll make rapid progress with a new version ofFSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically. So at first, logarithmic curve looks like this sort offairly straight upward line, diagonal and up. And so if you extrapolate that, then you have a greatthing. But then because it's actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series ofstacked logarithmic curves.Now I know I'm the boy who cried FSD, but man, I think we'll be better than human by the end ofthis year. That's not to say we're approved by regulators. And I'm saying then that, that would be inthe U.S. because we've got to focus on one market first. But I think we'll be better than human bythe end of this year. I've been wrong in the past, I may be wrong this time. And the price of FSD --so the way to think of the price of FSD is actually very low, it's not high. When you go back to whata singular -- the value of the car increased dramatically if it is actually autonomous. $15,000 isactually a low price, not a high price. And we will offer -- I think we do sort of offer FSD as a sortof monthly subscription. Although, like most people don't know that. So I'd recommend like maybetrying it out as a monthly subscription so you don't have to go with the $15,000 thing. But I thinkyes, obviously, if the car is worth several times its original price, $15,000 is actually a low price forFSD.","Elon Musk: I think we'll be better than human by the end of this year. $15,000 isactually a low price, not a high price.

I'd like to ask about -- so to stick on this AI topic, we've read with great interest thedevelopments in Dojo today, and you've spoken about FSD. But you've also -- Elon, you started thisx.ai company. And for investors that think that there might be quite a bit of value in the AI featuresand products of Tesla, it might be concerning to see you pursuing another endeavor where AI is thefocus. So can you talk about how x.ai might overlap, might perhaps compete, with Tesla or, in otherways, perhaps it enhances the value of what Tesla does?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, I think it will actually enhance the value of Tesla. There were just some of the world's best AIengineers and scientists that were willing to join a startup, but they were not willing to join a large,sort of relatively established company like Tesla. So I was like -- that's actually how it got started. Iwas interviewing a few people. And they're like, 'No, we want to do a startup."" I was like -- andthat's all -- I couldn't convince them to join Tesla. So I was like, ""Okay, well, better to start up that,that I run this, than they go work somewhere else.""

So it's -- like I said, I think there will be some value that xAI brings toTesla.Also, some of the very best people in the world, they really just want to work on interestingproblems. So if you take, say, our materials science group, really what convinced CharlieKuehmann to leave Apple, where he was very happy and well compensated, and both at -- to wherewe think is the best materials science group in the world, was that he got to work at both Tesla andSpaceX. He wasn't willing to leave Apple if it was just Tesla, but he was willing to do it if it wasTesla and SpaceX.

And what are the key puts and takes to get there?Zachary John Planell Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - Master of Coin & CFOThis is -- I think I was asked this in the past. This is very difficult to forecast. There's a series ofcosts that we manage, the series of cost in which we don't control. And so particularly on thecommodity side, where labor cost go, et cetera, it's just hard to say.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. And we saw very inflationary -- like strong inflationary pressures for a while last year, and now-- which obviously makes it very difficult to reduce COGS. And now we're seeing what seems to bedeflationary pressures, certainly deflationary -- deflation isn't pressure. But we're seeing commodityprices dropping as was mentioned -- as Karn mentioned a moment ago. And look, I mean what doyou think? I mean, basically, the trends seem to be deflationary at the commodity level.Karn Budhiraj -Definitely. There's that, and then there's also the unit economics improve as volumes grow. That'sthe other thing we're seeing. As we're becoming a bigger and better part of a lot of suppliers, theeconomies of scale come into play. There's equipment depreciation that comes into play. Equipmentthat was commissioned 5 to 7 years ago, that used to be a part of the piece price, that's completelyamortized. So we'll see situations where the piece price comes down because that equipmentcontribution has gone away.

During this call, we will discuss ourbusiness outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on ourpredictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to anumber of risks and uncertainties including those mentioned in our most recent filings with theSEC.During the question and answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and onefollowup. But before we jump into the Q&A, Elon has some openingremarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. So just a Q3 recap. Our last quarter was impacted by down time for global factoryupgrades that will help us reduce cost per vehicle as well as increase production. We remainfocused on 3 main objectives which is the cost reduction of our products, investments in artificialintelligence, and other growth projects like Optimus. And continued free cash flow generation.Regarding vehicle cost, our team was able to reduce the cost per vehicle further in Q3 despiteheadwinds from factory idle costs and ramp-up of new factories, and we believe there's stillmeaningful room for improvement there.Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicle has now driven over 0.5 billion miles with FSD Beta, FullSelf-Driving Beta, and that number is growing rapidly. We recently completed a 10,000 GPUcluster of H100s. We think probably bringing it into operation faster than anyone's ever brought thatmuch compute per unit time into production since training is the fundamental limiting factor onprogress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy.We're also seeing significant promise with FSD Version 12. This is the end-to-end AI where it's aphoton count in, controls out or really you can think of it as there's just a large bit stream coming inand a tiny bit stream going out, compressing reality into a very small set of outputs, which isactually kind of how humans work. The vast majority of human data input is optics, right from oureyes. And so we are, like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in themiddle.","Tesla's Q3 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update that we published at the same link as this webcast.

2023/10/18,"It's really interesting to think about that.We will continue to invest significantly in AI development as this is really the massive gamechanger, and I mean, success in this regard, in the long term, I think, has the potential to make Teslathe most valuable company in the world by far. If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fullyautonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it's not clear what the limit is.Regarding Energy Storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy, of storage products in Q3. And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest-margin business. Energy andservice now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit.The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about Cybertruck, I am too. I've driven the car.It's an amazing product. I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reachingvolume production with the Cybertruck and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive. This issimply normal for -- when you've got a product with a lot of new technology or any new -- brand-new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, youwill have problems proportionate to how many new things you're trying to solve at scale. So I justwant to emphasize that, one, I think this is potentially our best product ever, and I think it is our bestproduct ever. It is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cashflow positive at a price that people can afford.Often, people do not understand what is truly hard. That's why I say prototypes are easy, productionis hard. People think it's the idea or you make a prototype, you design a car. And as soon asdesigning a car is -- it's not just anyone can do it. It does require taste. It does require effort todesign a prototype. But the difficulty of going from a prototype to volume production is like10,000% harder to get to volume production than to make the prototype in the first place. And thenit is even harder than that to reach positive cash flow. That is why there have not been new car start-ups that have been successful for 100 years apart from Tesla.So I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck.

Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another recordquarter of profitability in our energy business. Congratulations to the Tesla team for their continuedfocus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, higherinterest rates and shifting consumer sentiment.As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planneddowntimes for our factory upgrades. This was necessary to allow for further factory improvementsand production rate increases. Despite those factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased toapproximately $37,500. We saw sequential decreases in material costs and freight. Reducing thecost of our vehicles is our top priority.On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continue to rise due to Cybertruck prototype buildsand pilot production testing, combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving Optimusand Dojo. We have and will continue to make investments in these areas and hence, our capitalexpenditure and R&D will continue to grow in the near term.However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations.This year itself we have generated operating cash flows of approximately $8.9 billion and free cashflows of approximately $2.3 billion.Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a stand-alone basis, with Energy businessleading the charge primarily from the growth in megabyte deployments. Our Services and Otherbusinesses, on a year-on-year basis, also continued to show positive momentum as we benefit fromour growing fleet.As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate thatmost car buying happens with one or other form of financing. And hence, we also view pricing interms of monthly costs for the customer. And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risensubstantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity.We've tried to offset such adjustments via our focus on reducing costs.","Tesla's Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planneddowntimes for our factory upgrades.

2023/10/18,"Thank you very much. And now let's go to investor questions. The first investor question comesfrom Craig. How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for 2024?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI scruple to make an accurate guess at this point, going back to what I said earlier that the ramp isgoing to be extremely difficult. And like I said, there's no way around that. If you try to make -- ifwe just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally 200 models that are slightvariations on a theme in the combustion engine world, just distinctions without a difference, thenit's really not that hard. But if you want to do something radical and innovative and somethingreally special like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because there's nothing to copy. You haveto invent it, not just the car but the way to make the car.So the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome. Now I can say that -- if yousay, ""Well, where will things end up,"" I think we'll end up with roughly 0.25 million Cybertrucks ayear, and -- but we're not -- I don't think we're going to reach that output rate next year. I think we'llprobably reach it sometime in 2025. That's my best guess.","Elon R.

The second question is can you provide a progress update on the 4680 cell, particularlyprogress towards performance improvements and cost savings outlined on Battery Day?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSure thing, Martin. 4680 cell production in Texas increased 40% quarter-over-quarter. Congrats tothe Texas team for producing their 20 millionth cell off of line 1. Texas is now our primary 4680facility. We're heavily focused on quality. Scrap is down 40% quarter-over-quarter. With theincreased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month over monthwithin the quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady-state goals. Andthat is our priority.The Cybertruck cell, with 10% higher energy than our Model Y cell, started production on line 2 inTexas. This quarter, we convert to building 100% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factoryas we ramp all 4 lines in Phase 1 over the next 3 quarters. Phase 2 of the Texas 4680 facility iscurrently under construction. The additional 4 lines incorporate further capital efficiencies overPhase 1, and our target is for them to start producing in late 2024.Lastly, in Kato, we're retooling to enable large-scale pilot runs of our next-generation cell designs.Kato's long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our massproduction facilities, enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp-ups of new designs.","The second question is can you provide a progress update on the 4680 cell, particularlyprogress towards performance improvements and cost savings outlined on Battery Day?Andrew D.

I am worried about the high interest rate environment that we're in. It's -- I just can'temphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment.And as interest rates rise, the proportion of that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally.So that's -- if interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it's that much harder to -- forpeople to buy the car. They simply can't afford it.So -- and we are tracking, I believe, at this point for Model Y to be the best selling car on earth, notjust in revenue but in unit value. If you compare that to the other vehicles that are #2 and #3 andwhatnot, they cost much less than our car. So we're just hitting the law of large numbers situationshere.I know people want us advertising. We are advertising. I think there is something to be gained onthe advertising front. I don't think it's nothing. But informing people of a car that is great but theycannot afford doesn't really help. So that is really the thing that must be sold, is to make the caraffordable or the average person cannot buy it for any amount of money.

And obviously, that same software and approach will enable Optimus to do useful thingsand enable Optimus to learn how to do things simply by looking. So extremely exciting in the longterm.As I've mentioned before, given that the economic output is the number of people timesproductivity, if you no longer have a constraint on people, effectively, you've got a humanoid robotthat can do as much as you'd like, your economy is twice the infinite or infinite for all intents andpurposes. So I don't think anyone is going to do it better than Tesla, not by a long shot. BostonDynamics is impressive, but their robot lacks the brain. They're like the Wizard of Oz or whatever.Yes, lacks the brain. And then you also need to be able to design the humanoid robot in such a waythat it can be mass manufactured. And then at some point, the robots will manufacture the robots.And obviously, we need to make sure that it's a good place for humans in that future. We do notcreate some variance of the Terminator outcome. So we're going to put a lot of effort into localizedcontrol of the humanoid robot. So basically, anyone will be able to shut it off locally, and you can'tchange that even if you put -- like a software update, you can't change that.

2023/10/18,"Sounds good. And the last question from Investors is neural net path planning represents asignificant advance in capability and safety for FSD. What steps is Tesla taking to make thistechnology available outside the U.S.?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes, our approach has been to try to get it -- like, the more places we're trying to make it work, theharder the problem is. So the reason we don't do it in all countries simultaneously is that it wouldtake much longer to make it work anywhere at all. So that's why it's currently just North America.And also for most parts of the world, you have to get approval before deploying things, whereas inthe U.S., you can deploy things at risk or at least you can take liability for what you're deploying.So it's a -- whereas most countries require some sort of extensive approval program. So we onlywant to go through that extensive approval program when we think it's kind of ready for prime timein that country.I apologize it's not out in those countries, but we keep finding ways to make it better. And it really --it needs to drive such that it exceeds even the unsupervised, significantly exceeds the probability ofinjury of a human or significantly better, a lower probability of injury than a human by far. I thinkwe're tracking to that point very quickly.Obviously, in the past, I've been overly optimistic about this. The reason I've been overly optimisticis that the progress tends to sort of look like a log curve, which is that you have kind of rapid initialimprovements that if you were to extrapolate that sort of rapid, fairly linear rate of improvement,you get to self-driving quite quickly, but then the rate of improvement curves over logarithmicallyas well as the asymptote. That's now happened several times. I would characterize our progress inreal world AI as a series of stacked log curves. I think that's also true in other parts of AI, like[LOMs] and whatnot, a series of stacked log curves. Each log curve gets higher than the last one.So if we keep stacking them, we keep stacking logs, eventually, we get to FSD.","The more places we're trying to make it work, theharder the problem is.

The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist.William Stein - Truist Securities, Inc., Research Division - MDWe learned earlier on the call, it sounds like you don't think the truck will ramp to significantvolume until its third year of production. Should we have a similar anticipation for the ramp of thenext-gen platform? Or is there any reason that we should be maybe more optimistic or pessimisticabout the ramp profile there?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, to be clear, it's not really the third year of production. It's kind of like the 18th monthof production is roughly my guess.

So I agree with you that asFSD improves, we should see its value increasing. But I guess like the ultimate values of FSD,which is to be able to handle like a robotaxi is not going to necessarily interest everybody, and youhave a bit of a degraded version that would be like a chauffeur service where the car drives byitself, but you still have to be in the car and around. And then there is like the hands-on, eyes-onversion of the service.

Yes.",,
2023/10/18,"Okay. Thank you very much. Let's go to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystReally nice to see the rate of vehicle cost improvement despite the downtime that you took. You'vetaken now about $2,000 out of the average vehicle costs over the past year. Can you give us maybea sense of the rate of improvement that you see from the changes that you alluded to, the factorychanges you alluded to? Is there a way maybe to convey the speed of improvement on your existingproduct from here? And then related to that, can you share the timing of your next gen -- the lower-priced product that you talked about earlier this year?Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOYes. So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you look into this.There are certain things which we control, and there are certain things which we don't control. Weget -- we expect that we'll get some benefits from our cost reduction efforts, which are all underway.But on the other hand, we just finished our factory upgrades late in Q3. Some of these factories arestill in the early ramp phase in Q4. We're still not up to where we want those factories to be. So theywill impact in the near term. Plus, like Elon mentioned, we're going to be ramping Cybertruck,which is going to be another headwind, which we will be dealing with.On top of all that, there's overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makesit harder to predict precisely as to where we land. But yes, this is something which -- it's anevolving thing which we're observing every day and reacting to it on a daily basis.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringI would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are not -- we are unflagging in our pursuitof additional cost downs for 2024. We do have a good pipeline of them and work on both theengineering side and the factory operations side. And our intention is to like maintain or exceed thetrend that you saw. We're trying as hard as we possibly can.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystThe timing of the next-gen product, can you share that?Elon R.

2023/10/18,"- Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorNot at this time.Rod Avraham Lache - Wolfe Research, LLC - MD & Senior AnalystOkay. And just as a follow-up, obviously, price is also a driver of demand, but that's obviously nothappening in a vacuum. And you mentioned that -- I think you mentioned at some point during thiscall that you're also maybe hitting the law of large numbers on some of your products. Can you justshare how you're thinking about price elasticity just at this point in this macro environment, and anythoughts along those lines?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorI think that there's very significant price elasticity. I mean to be totally frank, if our car costs thesame as a Rav4, nobody would buy a Rav4, or at least they're very unlikely to. It's worth noting thata lot of these incentives like the tax credit and whatnot, they're actually very difficult for the averageperson to access because they -- most people do not have $10,000 or even $7,500 burning a hole intheir bank account. A lot of -- a large number of people are living paycheck to paycheck and with alot of debt. They've got credit card debt, mortgage debt. So yes, it's -- that's reality for most people.It's sometimes difficult for people who are high income earners, and when I say high, it'd be likesomeone who's earning over $200,000 a year, to understand what life is like for someone who isearning $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a year, which is most people.So like, for a lot of people, like, this tax credit just -- they can't front $7,500 for 18 months or even 6months to -- for the tax credit, and they actually don't, in some cases even have that [an ancillary$7,500] in taxes. So it's really just the vast regard to people is how much money do they have to payimmediately and how much per month. That's it. You can stop right there. And our car is still muchmore expensive than a Rav4 when you look at it that way.Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOOne other thing which I'll add, when you look at car buying in general, we're trying to get to thenext set of EV adopters.Elon R.

2023/10/18,"- Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorNot an EV adopter, just who wants a great car.Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOExactly.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIt's not -- so now you get things like -- honestly, I would say, like, it somewhat correlates with thewhy doesn't everyone work from home crowd. I'm like -- I mean this is like some real MarieAntoinette vibes from people who say why isn't everyone working from home? Like, what about allthe people that have to come to the factory and pull the cars or all the people that have to go to therestaurant and make your food and deliver your food. It's like what are you talking about you -- Imean, how detached from reality does the work-from-home crowd have to be while they takeadvantage of all those who do -- who cannot work from home? So I mean, you have to say, like,""Why did I sleep in the factory so many times?"" Because it mattered.So I just can't emphasize again how important cost is. It's not an optional thing for most people. It isa necessary thing. We have to make our cars more affordable that people can buy it. And I keepharping on this interest thing, but I mean it just raises the cost of the car. I mean we're looking at itin an internal analysis, which I know we -- we think is more or less on track that when you look atthe cost -- or the price reductions we've made in, say, the Model Y and you compare that to howmuch people's monthly payment has risen due to interest rates, the price of the Model Y is almostunchanged.Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOIf you factor in the changing interest rates.Elon R.

2023/10/18,"It's howmuch money do they have to put down and do they literally have that in their bank account or theircheck balance? And then what is the monthly payment? And it doesn't matter how -- if that monthlypayment is principal interest or whatever, it's just a number, and that number has to not cause theirbank account to go negative.As it -- so going from near 0 interest rates to kind of the current very high interest rates, the actualmonthly payment is basically the same. It's just a bunch more of it is going to interest. And there aresome incremental challenges beyond that, which is the difficulty of getting credit at all hasincreased. And so there are a number of people who simply cannot get credit, period. Even ifthey've got a job and everything is solid, the banks are a little gun-shy on handing out credit giventhat a bunch of them kicked the bucket earlier this year.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. There's also just fewer options. Even if they hand out credit, there's fewer banks to go to.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIt's like does your bank still exist? Well, if your bank does not exist, you have to establish arelationship with a new bank. And so a lot of regional banks have died, and I mean even CreditSuisse, I mean, geez, that was a shocker. You've got a 160-year-old-ish Swiss institution that doesn'texist anymore. That's mind-blowing. And I think there's still quite a few shoes to drop on the badcredit situation. I mean commercial real estate obviously is in terrible shape. Credit card debt hasbeen rising significantly. The credit card interest rates are usurious. It's over 20% interest rates,meaning like -- which over time just becomes obviously extremely punishing. Because ifsomebody's paying 20% interest on their credit cards, it means they cannot pay them off. And if youcannot pay them off and you're still accruing interest at 20%, you're at best headed to a bad place.","Elon Musk: There are a number of people who simply cannot get credit, period.

2023/10/18,"Thank you. Let's go to next question from George from Canaccord.George Gianarikas - Canaccord Genuity Corp., Research Division - AnalystJust to focus on the cost per vehicle coming down in future quarters as you discussed in yourwritten remarks, I'm curious as to what the levers of that could be. Is it more scale, more factoryutilization? Is it material cost reductions? Are there things like Gigacasting? I mean can you justkind of give us some data points to give us confidence that that's going to come down over time?And if I can sneak one in, please, there are press reports, and I know how perilous it is to believesome of these, but they say that you've included radar as an option in some Model Ys in China. AndI'm just here to ask if that's true. And if so, why?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe've not included radar. We have radar as -- a Tesla-designed radar is an experiment in Model Sand X. That's it. We'll see whether that experiment is worth it, but there are no plans to integrateradar into 3 or Y . Just as humans drive well, and in fact, an excellent human driver can drive withamazing safety simply with their eyes, the car will far exceed the average human safety just withvisual, far, far, far. Because, I mean, the car is looking at all directions at once, and we don't haveeyes on the back of our head. So -- and the computer never gets tired and never gets distracted, getdrunk, hopefully.And so radar is -- what really matters is how much does it affect the probability of an accident. Andin order for the radar to be effective, you have to be able to do radar-only braking or you have to doactions that are radar only. Otherwise, you get this disambiguation problem between vision andradar. That's why we actually turned off the radar in cars historically that we had chipped. All 3 andY used to have radar, but we turned it off because the radar actually generated more noise thansignal.","There are no plans to integrateradar into 3 or Y .

That comesobviously on the engineering side as we come up with new innovations but as well on the supplychain side with our partners, we work with them to automate some of their lines, remove theirbottlenecks and their high cost as well.

2024/1/24,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast. My name isMartin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and anumber of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in theupdate deck we published at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some operating remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorThank you. So the Tesla team did an incredible job in 2023. We achieved record production anddeliveries of about 1.8 million vehicles, in line with our official guidance. And in Q4, we wereproducing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost 2 million cars a year. This is really aphenomenal achievement.Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made 560,000 cars. This is a record. In fact, it's thehighest output of automotive plant in North America. And people are often surprised that thehighest output factory -- car factory in North America is in the San Francisco Bay Area. It's a littlecounterintuitive perhaps.And the -- it's really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area. What would have been arun-down strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas. Think about that. It wasderelict when we got it, and now it's the most productive plant in this entire part of the world. Andit's enriched the community in so many different ways. It's really a gem. So I'm super proud of thepeople that work there.Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted, and the best-selling vehicle of anykind, not just electric vehicles, with over 1.2 million units delivered. The Energy Storage businessdelivered nearly 15 gigawatt hours of batteries in 2023 compared to 6.5 gigawatt hours the yearbefore, so tremendous year-over-year growth, triple digits. And yes, I think we'll continue to seevery strong growth in storage as predicted.","Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and anumber of other executives.

2024/1/24,"I said for many years that the storage business will growmuch faster than the car business, and it is doing that.Free cash flow remained strong at $4.4 billion in 2023 in spite of record spending on futureprojects. So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D.This brings us to 2024. There's a lot to look forward to in 2024. Tesla is currently between 2 majorgrowth waves. We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full self-driving and other projects, is executed as well as possible. For fullself-driving, we've released version 12, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to priorversions. This is end-to-end artificial intelligence. So [nothing but] nets basically, photons in andcontrols out.And it really is quite a profound difference. This is currently just with employees and a fewcustomers, but we will be rolling out to all who -- all those -- all customers in U.S. who request fullself-driving in the weeks to come. That's over 400,000 vehicles in North America.So this is the first time AI has been used not just for object perception but for pathfinding andvehicle controls. We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets. It's really quiteremarkable.So as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference.Out of necessity, we've actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardwarebecause hardware 3 at this point is several years old. So I don't -- I think we're quite far ahead ofany other company in the world in terms of AI inference efficiency, which is going to be a veryimportant metric in the future in many arenas.So see, the new Model 3 is now available globally, so we did an update in Model 3. While the carlooks similar, a lot of work has gone into the vehicle to make it better in every way. It issignificantly quieter, more refined, better equipped, has longer range and many other improvements,and I recommend taking it for a test drive. If you have not driven a Model 3 in a long time, youshould really try the new one, so steady improvements.And we're very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle. This is an earnings call, not aproduct announcement.","Free cash flow remained strong at $4.4 billion in 2023 in spite of record spending on future projects. Tesla is currently between 2 majorgrowth waves. We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full self-driving and other projects, is executed as well as possible. For fullself-driving, we've released version 12, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to priorversions. This is end-to-end artificial intelligence. So [nothing but] nets basically, photons in andcontrols out. It's really quiteremarkable. So I don't -- I think we're quite far ahead ofany other company in the world in terms of AI inference efficiency.",,
2024/1/24,"So there'll not be many questions that try to ask us about new productscoming, but we reserve product announcements for product announcements, not earning calls. So --but we're very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound not just in its design of thevehicle itself but in the design of the manufacturing system. This is a revolutionary manufacturingsystem, significant -- far more advanced than any other automotive manufacturing system in theworld like by a significant margin.Several years ago, I said the -- perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in thefuture will be manufacturing technology. And you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle.The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin,Texas. And then we'll follow that up with other locations around the world, probably our -- thefactory we built in Mexico will be second, and then we'll be looking to identify a third locationperhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America.In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries and a strong free cashflow in spite of a very high interest rate environment. And we are focused on exciting new projectsthat will -- I think, ultimately, if we execute on all these things, and it is very hard to do all thesethings, not a sure thing, but I do see a path where Tesla could 1 day be the most valuable companyin the world. I do want to emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now aset of possible outcomes. And previously, I would not have thought it is a set of possible outcome.So -- and thank you again to all of our investors, our employees and our suppliers for a strong yearand looking forward to a great 2024 and years to come.

2024/1/24,"Thank you, and our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOThanks, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone. As Elon mentioned, we had a record year in terms ofboth production and deliveries for our auto business as well as record deployments in our energybusiness. This was achieved despite 2023 being a challenging year in terms of higher interest ratesand higher inflation. Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period. Iwould also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout.In terms of our 2023 financials, we ended the year with over $96 billion of revenue and generated$4.4 billion of free cash flow to end the year with over $29 billion of cash and investments on hand.Our 2023 GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of onetime noncash benefit of $5.9billion from the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. This was due to ourrecent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have recentlygone through a similar change in their accounting.Accordingly, starting with Q1, our booked tax rate will now be more in line with other companies inthe S&P 500. In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despiteus being in the early phase of Cybertruck era. As a result, our auto gross margin improvedsequentially. That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are manymoving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control, like the change in tariffs orlocal incentives, to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approachingthe limits within our current platforms.On the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in 2023. We fullyappreciate the importance of customer education as we are still in the customer acquisition phase.Our data suggests that around 90% of our vehicle buyers in 2023 never owned a Tesla before. Weare being creative in figuring out ways to bring in new customers and educate them about thebenefits of owning a Tesla versus gas-powered vehicles, the key among them being total cost ofownership. This concept is mostly overlooked for just the upfront cost.","Thanks, Elon.

2024/1/24,"Thank you, and let's go through investor questions. Question #1 is from Michael. Given that youmoved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the time lineimproved so that we might see the next-generation platform vehicles in 2025?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorWe -- I mean I won't certainly say things with -- that should be taken with a grain of salt since I'moften optimistic. But I don't want to blow your mind, but I'm often optimistic regarding time. Butour current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025, sometime in thesecond half. That's just what our current schedule says. There's a lot of new technology, like atremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here.The reason I want to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because wereally need the engineers to be living on the line. This is not sort of off-the-shelf, just works type ofthing. And it's just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live on the line if it's in Austin versuselsewhere. So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half of next year. Thatwill be a challenging production ramp. Like I can't emphasize, we'll be sleeping on the linepractically. In fact, not practically, we will be.But I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any othermanufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world. It's next level. So it's always difficultto predict what that S curve of manufacturing looks like. It always starts off real slow, and then itgrows exponentially. So -- and predicting that intermediate S curve is difficult but -- so I don'tknow. It's hard to say what the unit volume would be next year. We're not going to make anypredictions on that front, but it does seem quite likely that we will start production next year.","Elon Musk: We are currently expecting to start production second half of next year.

Drew?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. First, I just want to allay any concerns regarding 4680 limiting the Cybertruck ramp becauseI've seen some people commenting about that. Today, 4680 production is ahead of the ramp withactually weeks of finished cell inventory. And the goal is to keep it that way not only for Cyber butfor our future vehicle programs. And as Elon said, it is an S curve here too. Like it's hard to predictthese things. But I'm just describing our goals.Elon R.

And as with any major new product introduction, the factory andengineering teams collaborated to ensure quality of the new design and the process changes as theirfirst priority. And now our focus returns to cost and production ramp in Q1.And in terms of what we're doing, we're currently running 1 production line, 1 assembly line, using2 assembly lines in addition for yield and rate improvement trials, and we have a fourth incommissioning, and 4 more will be installed starting in Q3 this year.

I guess let me explain why -- what my concern is here, which is that I see a path to creating anartificial intelligence and robotics juggernaut of truly immense capability and power. And myconcern would be -- I don't want to control it, but if I have so little influence over the company atthat stage that I could sort of be voted out by some sort of random shareholder advisory firm --we've had a lot of challenges with institutional shareholder services, ISS, I call them ISIS, andGlass Lewis, which there's a lot of activists that basically infiltrate those organizations and havestrange ideas about what should be done.So I want to have enough to be -- like if we could do a dual-class stock, that would be ideal. I'm notlooking for additional economics. I just want to be an effective steward of very powerfultechnology.And the reason I just sort of roughly picked approximately 25% was that that's not so much that Ican control the company even if I go bonkers.

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOkay. Well, it's really tough to find the unmute button on Teams, guys. I'm sorry for being late. Soyes, my question would be on like the cost reduction. You've talked about it already a lot. And if Ilook at it over the last like 5, 6 quarters on average, the COGS per car has been coming down likemore than 2% sequentially on average. So that means you are like on a trajectory of COGS per cargoing down 10% a year. So that's probably like unheard of in the auto industry. I don't think any carmanufacturer ever achieved that.But that's very, very mundane and very -- it's a good performance, but it's a very normalperformance in a lot of other manufacturing industry like microelectronics or consumer electronics.And so I'd love to hear your thoughts about whether you consider yourself closer to the latter, tolike a microelectronics business, where you have this ability to actually always improve costs, youhave more control on how things are pulled together into your cars, and you see yourselfsustainably taking costs down with that kind of pace. Or do you think your ability to take down costis actually going to become more like in line with the rest in the industry over time?Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOYes. I think I've covered this in a pretty lengthy detail even in my opening remarks and in aprevious question, but to just further clarify, we are constantly looking for what we can do to reducecosts. Like I said, it's a game of pennies. We've talked about it before as well. And the team isconstantly going and checking where can we reduce the cost further. And do I believe that we willhave the same pace which you've seen over the past few years? Probably not because, remember,we were coming out with a period wherein commodity prices were rising. So then we did seebenefits coming from that.So those are more or less taken care of, but there is more, which we're still chasing.","The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from NewStreet Research.

2024/1/24,"Yes, GPU's a funny word, like vestigial.So -- and a lot of our progress in self-driving is training limited. Something that's important withtraining, it's much like a human. The more effort you put into training, the less effort you need ininference. So just like a person, if you train in a subject, sort of class, 10,000 hours, the less mentaleffort it takes to do something. If you remember when you first started to drive how much of yourmental capacity it took to drive, it was -- you had to be focused completely on driving. And afteryou've been driving for many years, it only takes a little bit of your mind to drive, and you can thinkabout other things and still drive safely.So the more training you do, the more efficient it is at the inference level. So we do need a lot oftraining. And we're pursuing the dual path of NVIDIA and Dojo, but I would think of Dojo as along shot. It's a long shot worth taking because the payoff is potentially very high but it's notsomething that is a high probability. It's not like a sure thing at all. It's a high risk, high payoffprogram. Dojo is working, and it is doing training jobs, so -- and we are scaling it up. And we haveplans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2, Dojo 3 and whatnot. So I think it's got potential.I can't emphasize enough, high risk, high payoff. So I think it still makes sense given the -- even ifit's a low probability of success for the -- I think anyway -- I'm belaboring the subject. It's a veryinteresting program. It has the potential for something special. There's also our inference hardwarein the car, so we're now on what's called Hardware 4, but it's actually version 2 of the Tesla-designed AI inference chip.And we're about to complete design of -- the terminology is a bit confusing. About to completedesign of Hardware 5, which is actually version 3 of the Tesla-designed chip because the version 1was Mobileye. Version 2 was NVIDIA, and then version 3 was Tesla. So -- and we're makinggigantic improvements from 1 -- from Hardware 3 to 4 to 5.I mean there's a potentially interesting play where when cars are not in use in the future, that the in-car computer can do generalized AI tasks, can run a sort of GPT4 or 3 or something like that.","We're pursuing the dual path of NVIDIA and Dojo, but I would think of Dojo as along shot.

Or should we kind of be modeling that itkind of stays at this level into '24?Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOWe are definitely aware of the cost increases, which are coming through because of the wageincreases. But like I said, we keep looking at other cost opportunities and try and figure out whereelse can we cut down. So there is definitely more opportunity to bring down costs further. I won'tspecifically guide to a number, which we will try and get to, but there's definitely more opportunitythere.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes, we're chasing lots of cost opportunities on the design side still for 2024. North of 8 figures iswhat we're -- just in my organization. Lars has got a bunch. And then from a commoditiesperspective, it's such a long cycle time through the whole material supply chain that even with whatwe've already seen to this point, there's more to come on commodities reductions.Unidentified Company Representative -And there's still some tailwind left on the commodities.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringThat's what I mean. Yes.Unidentified Company Representative -Aluminum and steel.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. And battery materials.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Technoking of Tesla, CEO & DirectorIt boggles my mind to think that if we make a 1% improvement in cost, that's $1 billion. So it's like,on average, if we reduce the cost by $0.01, $1 billion. What? I mean we started off not long ago thatwe're only making like 10 cars a week.","Andrew D.

With goodexecution -- like I said, it's not a slam dunk, but with -- if we execute very well, I think Tesla couldbe the most valuable company in the world.","With goodexecution -- like I said, it's not a slam dunk, but with -- if we execute very well, I think Tesla couldbe the most valuable company in the world. And yes, where does it lead ultimately? With good execution, it could be a very, very valuable company. It could be one of the biggest companies in the history of the world, if not the biggest. It's a very exciting time for Tesla, and I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes from here. I think we're going to see a lot more of this in the coming years, and it's going to be very exciting.",,
2024/1/24,"Thank you. Colin, do you have a follow-up question?Colin M. Langan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division - Senior Equity AnalystYes, just a quick follow-up. In the commentary, you mentioned the taxes would go to the S&P 500level. I think you've been trending slightly below 10%. S&P, I think it's typically 25%-ish. Is thatgoing to -- should we expect that to jump right up next year when we're modeling next year? Orwould it be like a gradual change over the next few years? And any cash impact from that taxchange as well that we should be considering?Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOYes. So there's no impact on cash taxes from the release of the valuation amount, which I spokeabout. What it does is it's how you account for taxes on your books. So it's basically an accountingchange wherein there are certain jurisdictions because we had enough NOLs, et cetera, wherein wedidn't have to accrue book taxes. Now that the valuation allowance has been released and we haverecognized deferred tax assets on the books, that means your tax rate immediately goes up.","Vaibhav Taneja - Tesla, Inc. - CFO, Corporate Controller & CAOYes.
