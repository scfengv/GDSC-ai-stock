At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jeﬀ Evanson. Please go ahead. Jeﬀ Evanson Thank you, Patrick and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Teslas fourth quarter Q&A webcast. Im joined today by Elon Musk, Teslas Chairman and CEO, JB Straubel, our CTO and Deepak Ahuja, Teslas CFO. We announced our ﬁnancial and operational results today in a shareholder letter thats available at the same link as this webcast and a replay of this webcast will be available later today at the same link. The shareholder letter includes GAAP and non-GAAP ﬁnancial results, as well as reconciliations between the two. Our non-GAAP measures add back deferred revenue and related expenses for cars delivered where the cash has been or will soon be collected. These non-GAAP results also exclude stock-based compensation and non-cash interest expense. Revenues and cost associated with cars leased directly through us are treated the same in our GAAP and non-GAAP ﬁnancial information. During the call, we will be discussing our business outlook and making other forward-looking statements, which are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could diﬀer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties including those mentioned in our most recent 10-Q ﬁled with the SEC. And now Patrick, if you could assemble the queue and have our  question please? Question-and-Answer Session",

Elon Musk Thank you. Andrea James So just quickly can you help me get to a free cash ﬁgure, looks like you can do $1.5 billion in CapEx, but whats going to be the operating cash to oﬀset that? Deepak Ahuja Yes, we will have clearly signiﬁcant - Deepak here, hi Andrea. Andrea James Hi. Deepak Ahuja We would have signiﬁcant positive operating cash , obviously as our business --our volume gross and our gross margin continues to improve. Well also have some cash used on our direct leasing program. Our expectation is that we will establish shop via warehouse line for leasing cars and that will continue to grow and fund the big portion for leasing funding required. So overall, we feel pretty comfortable where we are in terms of our 2015 look from a cash burn perspective. Andrea James So maybe about $1 billion is that about inline of cash burn? Deepak Ahuja Should be less than that. Andrea James Okay. Deepak Ahuja Yes, considering that we will have a lease warehouse line which continues to expand. Andrea James Got it. And so then another point, it looks like you expanded your residual value guarantee into extra markets late last year. And then I saw last week youre giving and recharging, home charging to focus in China. So I guess my question is it looks like you have really pretty good demand, global wait times increases, so why continue to give incentives to buy the cars if demand is so high? Deepak Ahuja Sorry Straubel. JB Straubel Well, I think fundamentally in China, we want to make sure we are not creating any hurdles or issues that create a negative customer experience. And charging installation given the varied regulations and challenges there has been a customer experience and they want to overcome that by providing [indiscernible]. Elon Musk Yes, but this is also something thats considered standard in China, just like buying an BMW i3 or Elite something that considers the standard things. So were just matching what competitors do. But this whole China thing has been blown way out of portion. We didnt execute people well on China last year, but it didnt really matter or people couldnt quite get that, like its not like the all these extra cars we could have produced and its only wed had bunch more customers in China, we could have [indiscernible] those cars.",

Essentially, it didnt matter whether we, meaning to the company as a whole, whether we saw a lot of cars in China or a small number of cars in China, [indiscernible] couple of cars to U.S. or Europe as in China. So it wasnt a high priority for the company, because it wasnt a constraining factor. Now obviously, in the long-term we do want to succeed in China and make sure were doing a good job. And I think just like the rest of the world, China wants to have the best products and we think the Model S is the best car in world and thats indicated by a multiple outside assessment. I am pretty sure that people in China want the best car in the world. So thats something we got to make sure, we take that right foundation for future growth. But it was essentially irrelevant to last year. Thats an important point. And the biggest issue which were still ﬁghting to address is this perception that is as to charge your car in China. This is false it is not to charge your car in China. Unfortunately, this sounds kind of brain dead but our sales team was telling people that it was to charge in China. Even though this is not true like that is pretty silly. And so I put the guy who was in charge of the supercharger rollout in China, is doing an awesome job, an engineer basically, hes not a sales person, in charge of China to make sure that charging is super easy and excellent. Hes not a marketing guys or sales guy, he is like, he is an engineer and hes an operations guys and hes going to make sure that people have, where customers are trying to have a fantastic experience and then just like in other countries those customers become our sales force and the product sales grow by word of mouth. Andrea James So, is this a company philosophy because it seems like you are putting engineers in charge of customer service even globally, with Jerome, I mean is customer service an engineering problem? Elon Musk I think if you have got people that are good at creative problem solving and they will – theyll be good at creative problem solving.",

And I am conﬁdent that soon, by the end of this year that will be in really good shape in China and yes Im pretty optimistic about it. I dont think thats some sort of unique issue in China and if you look at sales, sales, our sales in Hong Kong our sales in Hong Kong are excellence. But we dont have that misconception of charging issue in Hong Kong. And everybody lives in apartment building as well, so it is not like it is super easy to get local charging. . And so Im conﬁdent that just as weve seen high demand in every other part of the world that well see it in China as well. Andrea James And just to the point that thank you for the clarity on China. Just to my point on the residual value guarantee. Is that something that you plan on keeping and why keep it and what are your thoughts about that? Elon Musk Yes. Thats a good question. Ive actually debated like should we keep it or shouldnt we keep it because it is moot. The residual value guarantee matches what other premium sedans. And see after three year time period but our actual residual values are substantially above that, so never actually matters. And we are not like paying up residual value guarantee are actually volumes especially about that so never actually matters, we are not going to paying out residual value guarantees because the car is worth more than the residual value and - this kind of messes up our accounting because we have to treat it like a pseudo-lease. On the other hand, if we withdrew it, then does that mean – would people take that as a lack of conﬁdence in our product and if they might, they might misconstrue it as such.",

So, I think its really important, because we get some criticism about GAAP versus non-GAAP, as though like when we do non-GAAP were actually trying to trick people, and so thinking something is better than it is. But actually its not true, I dont - I think that the way the accounting rules currently work dont give a correct picture, were trying to give a more correct picture of non-GAAP, not a less correct picture. The between -- from our gross margin GAAP and non-GAAP were basically the same. So, when we look for revenue the between the GAAP and non-GAAP its just - it comes down to just two things, this residual value guarantee, where we - as we just talked about, it moot . But because of the pseudo-lease we have to recognize the revenue overtime, even though we got the cash immediately. So our cash with non-GAAP is the accurate representation of cash , which is what really matters. And yes, so and then even in non-GAAP, we dont - for leases that we do internally, they actually arent even covered in non-GAAP. JB Straubel And we didnt receive the full cash up front. So its aligned with our cash . Elon Musk Exactly, exactly it is aligned to cash . JB Straubel Right, whereas in some other auto company the moment they sell the car to a dealership, we understand they recognizable full revenue, but even though the ﬁnancing entity might lease that car and so they dont have the cash s, but they have a GAAP revenue. So in some sense our non-GAAP revenue is pretty clean and it aligns up well with our cash . Elon Musk Yes, this is really important, because were into one point to emphasize, because like - because there might be -- are we perhaps exaggerating our revenues relative to how other car companies may represent their revenues. And what Deepak just said is a very good point. What the other car companies will do is they will sell the cars to the dealer groups, but then they will then turn around and reﬁnance those same cars. So they are sending it through the laundromat, it is basically what theyre doing.",

So yes, and then even for leases that we do ourselves, we can securitize those leases whenever we want. So, we can take those leases, fund them and put them into a securitization program or just get a warehouse loan to recover the capital. The reason were using our existing capital is just basically common sense, because weve got a big bank balance thats earning a 0.1% or basically nothing, actually minus whatever the inﬂation rate is. And so, it makes more sense for us to put that capital to work with consumer leases and current 2% to 3% thats basically what it amounts to, but whenever we want to recover that capital we can do so through warehouse balance securitization.

I wanted to explore a bit where you see the trajectory of CapEx and OpEx. You gave some guidance for next year, but as we kind of think ahead to the Gigafactory and as we think ahead to the model -- the Gen 3 launch, how do you see those trends going over the next several years. JB Straubel We are going to spend staggering amounts of money on CapEx. I mean for a good reason and with the great ROI. And its important to not look at the CapEx in isolation because like that CapEx obviously is being done for reason in order to capture substantial future revenue . I am just saying the back-of-the-envelope -- if you make certain assumptions I emphasize these are just certain assumptions. Im not saying they are true although they will occur, but I bet that they do occur, personally, that is my personal opinion. I mean if you take this years revenue around $6 billion or thereabout and if we are able to maintain a 30% growth rate for ten years added to your 10% proﬁtability number and have 20PE, our market cap would be basically the same as Apple today. Now thats going to require a bit - on the order of $700 billion#. Obviously, getting [indiscernible] acquire some signiﬁcant CapEx. But Im hopeful that we can do this without any signiﬁcant dilution to the company. So maybe minor dilution, but nothing serious. Brian Johnson And how about in terms of operating expense and do you have a target for reported margins versus kind of thinking about your remarks in the second press conference at [indiscernible] where margins would be if youd stop growing? Is there a between the margins on the non-GAAP basis wed actually see, versus what they would be if you werent making those kind of investments? Deepak Ahuja You mean proﬁt margin as opposed to gross margin? Brian Johnson Yes, yes the operating margin. Deepak Ahuja Yes, I mean, we could easily get to 10%, 15%. I probably if we - say somewhere between 10% or 15%. Because some of that gross margins that this year will probably, by the end of the year be somewhere around 30%. Then if 20 of those points go to sort of ﬁxed cost and R&D and what not and then at least 10 leftover for proﬁtability.",

Deepak Ahuja Yes Id like to emphasis that doesnt mean [indiscernible] proﬁtable, it means really proﬁtable. It to pass your question Brian in terms of separating OpEx between the fast growing company like Tesla versus steady-state, clearly we want to invest in the future, but we want to do it eﬃciently and we are going to focus on being eﬃcient with our OpEx fundamentally this year. Elon Musk That is a key thing. The simple math of headcount requires this. Were basically little over 10,000 people aiming for somewhere over 55,000 cars this year. Just get to 0.5 million cars a year if we do not improve our productivity per person, we would need 100,000 people. I am not sure we would really park. So clearly there need to be dramatic improvement in productivity which are underway. Brian Johnson Right, and so when you said 10% was that 10% whilst still growing to the millions of cars target you talked about in 2025, or thats kind of 10% when you get to that millions of cars target? Elon Musk Yes I think its important were actually to be able to maintain 10% proﬁtability in spite of nutty growth, because you just run out of way to spend money. It is good to become like Apple. Theyre just running out of way to spend money. They spend money like it is water over there and they still cant spend enough of it? JB Straubel I think for us we are a single vehicle platform company at this point for our engineering expenses have their ebbs and s. So that has an impact, but as we grow will become a portfolio of vehicle platforms even with nutty growth we can get to a very good operating margin. Elon Musk Yes, its sort of planned like we are doing this -- and its mentioned in the letter , but there is massive infrastructure expansion going on like really massive like setting up service centers worldwide, creating an ubiquitous Supercharger network worldwide, just across all these countries growing with customs and the unique elements for each country. We are massively increasing this sort of scope and scale of Tesla in order to lay a foundation for future growth. Brian Johnson Okay, great.",

When does CapEx slow into depreciation and gross margin, what kind of timeframes for the CapEx in terms of depreciable life spends, are you assuming on things like Gigafactory, factory drilling and so forth? Deepak Ahuja So to answer your question, when assets are put to use for production and delivery of cars, thats when depreciation kicks oﬀ, so a lot of our spend this year is on production capacity expansion and Model X tooling. Those the assets saw depreciation when Model X starts producing. The Gigafactory assets clearly will go into -- would be depreciated when we start producing cells that are being used for production and it depends on our revenue growth. And the life of -- the depreciation life depends on the kind of asset. It can vary from ﬁve years for tooling to longer if its equipment, and if its facility then it could be for 15 to 30 years.

First back China, do you have any concerns about your ability to pursue business in China on terms that protect your interests? What I mean is like, if you look at the German manufacturers, they dont seem to have any problem with 50/50 JV structures or with bit local partners and not having control on selling through franchisers. Are you able to - are those terms that you are comfortable doing business with in China? Deepak Ahuja Well, I think we deﬁnitely going to - want to have local manufacturing or some amount of local R&D as well in the future in China. Its not going to make a ton of sense for the long term to be building a huge number of cars in California and shipping them to China. But right now were still at the early stages, so its to say exactly what happens in the future. I mean, our goals in the short-term in China is just very straightforward which is just to build out our service and Supercharger infrastructure and just get the basic foundational elements there, and we are not going through dealers as we are not going through dealers anywhere in the world. So our activities in China currently are housed and Tesla-owned and it sort of depends on what the evolving landscape is in China as to whether, where, and how a JV would have to be setup . Adam Jonas Okay, Elon just on the patents, its been eight months since you opened up the patents for competitors to use, any takers of any signiﬁcant technology? Im not aware of any. Are or you surprised there have not been more, and is this just a function of just -- kind of is it hubris and pride, or your competitors they just dont have the kind of intellectual capabilities or software engineering depth to kind of contextualize what you have to oﬀer. Elon Musk Im quite sure that there will be -- and that actually manufacturers are currently [indiscernible] use our patents, but just important to remember the design cycle from the point of which you can use intellectual property, youve got sort of incorporate the design, that designs got to -- youve got to do detailed engineering and design, you got to tool things out, and then youve got to go to production.",

First question is your cash burn continues to be pretty aggressive here. So the question is, if demand is strong as you guys are saying, and really the issue is on the supply side, why wouldnt you raise prices in all regions to at least set oﬀ - oﬀset the FX headwinds. And the reason Im asking this is, if you get more demand than you can handle, this wont hurt deliveries, it should also clearly beneﬁt cash and investors and it will also support the residual values for your current owners. So it sounds like a win-win all around, so can you just address that please? Elon Musk Well, I actually kind of think our car is expensive as it is. Its really not a cheap car. For a huge number of our customers, its the most expensive car that they have ever bought, and they didnt think they would ever buy a car that costs $100,000. So Im reluctant to raise that price as we start running into fundamental aﬀordability limits. As it is, we are expecting to be signiﬁcantly - have signiﬁcant positive cash in the latter half of the year. So yes, I mean, therell be sort of a short-term debt, but its clearly quite positive at the end of the year, and then going into 2016, even more so. Deepak Ahuja And I think thats completely linked to a major product launch. Especially in the automotive industry, you have to invest in the CapEx for manufacturing capacity and then the cash comes through when you launch. Elon Musk Yes. John Lovallo Just to be clear on that, when you say youre going to be cash positive by the end of the year, thats after CapEx? Deepak Ahuja Thats our - yes, that is expectation and I think we got to have focus on the long-term, while this is a short-term issue in terms of timing of CapEx versus revenue. Elon Musk But yes, - but to answer your question, yes, even in the face of signiﬁcant CapEx, we expect to be cash positive in Q4. John Lovallo In Q4? Okay.

John Lovallo Okay, thanks. And then the next question is - there has been a lot of discussions about persistent drivetrain issues, and weve heard everything from diﬀerent customers from persistent humming noises to complete failures, so the question is, I mean how pervasive is the drivetrain issue? What is the cost to replace a drivetrain? And I was a little surprised to see that the warranty reserves would not move up quarter-over-quarter? Elon Musk Yes. I think there is a lot of noise on the forums, but its not quite as bad as people make -- –for most people, they dont experience any drivetrain issue at all. There was a period of time, basically for a month or two about a year ago where – it was kind of getting into the weeds, but the application of grease on the spline of the motor was incorrect, and that caused the spline to wear out and stripped the spline on the drag in on the motor. So that particularly aﬀected sports, and unfortunately it happened to coincide with a - when a whole batch of cars headed for Norway. So unfortunately – it disproportionately aﬀected the Norwegian customers. Weve taken great pains to try to address. Essentially what it amounted to ﬁx that issue for example is just to youve got a full drive unit and then send it to get remanufactured where we replaced the rotor and... JB Straubel And maybe to the warranty, this is JB, to the warranty reserve question, weve actually improved quite a bit a lot in our eﬃciency at repairing the drive unit. So it might be swapped for a given customer, but that unit doesnt get trashed, it gets repaired. And the elements that need to get repaired are increasingly narrow, and we are really targeting them quite directly, even the rotor can be repaired at this point. Elon Musk Yes. And there was a diﬀerential clunk that was causing a diﬀerential clunk which can actually be ﬁxed with a two-part shim in the service center, so we were able to ﬁgure out the service center ﬁx to address that without even dropping the drive unit.",

And then ﬁnally, Elon, I just wanted to ask you about your comment about GAAP proﬁtability not being reached until 2020, and I know you guys say that the non-GAAP ways – is way to think about it, and Im not disagreeing with that here, but what I am suggesting is that if theres not going to be GAAP proﬁtability until 2020, and we kind of walk down from The Streets consensus non-GAAP number to a GAAP number by adding back stock comp, adding back non-cash interest expense, and making an assumption on the leasing, my estimate would suggest that Street estimates are 30% to 60% too high because the GAAP component of that non-GAAP number would need to be eliminated. So if you guys could just help me think about if that math is incorrect, and more importantly, what is the path to proﬁtability for Tesla? Elon Musk Sure, I think people read too much into my comment because I was asked, when do I think Tesla will have full-year GAAP proﬁtability, and sort of then you are going to the sort of residual varying [indiscernible] question like do we continue doing that or do we not continue doing that, because the half of the cars are ﬁnanced, right. So, that basically chops our revenue in half in a lot of cases. John Lovallo Leasing as well. Elon Musk I mean leasing, so if leasing and residual value guarantee of half the cars that would basically [indiscernible] aﬀect revenue recognition, and then is it – if it is a quarter basis or is it a full year. Thats why I said its probably 2020, its the full year, and its GAAP. Thats - what that actually means is that Teslas free cash is incredible in 2020, its able to overwhelm even the non-GAAP stuﬀ. So, I think people didnt understand that what I said was extremely optimistic, not a pessimistic statement. John Lovallo Okay, thank you guys.",

A couple of diﬀerent ones, kind of a lower level one, as far as the X goes in timing, could you just talk about -- I know you reiterated deliveries in Q3 and just your conﬁdence level around that, and then maybe one of the questions we get a lot is if we extend that to the Gen 3 and your 2017 timeframe, can you just talk about what work youre doing there and how conﬁdent youre getting to that timeline? Elon Musk Yes, its fair criticism, implied criticism. –This feels like this paradox here is like were sort of halfway there at any given point, but really at this - the X design is done. So, its just a question of tolling and supply chain at this point, and then making sure as we do the ramp up on X that out quality is excellent. It doesnt [indiscernible], obviously we want to make sure we have a really great experience, we dont have them - have any sort of issues or problems, but it is really – just like I said, it is just tooling and supply chain, and were trying to make that go as fast as possible. So, were highly conﬁdent of delivering our customer cars this summer and then spooling up to signiﬁcant volume in Q4. Now with respect to Model 3, we deﬁnitely dont want the delays that aﬀected the X to aﬀect the Model 3, and were really – we are being quite contentious about this, and I mean there are things that we could do with the Model 3 platform that are really adventurous but with the schedule risk. So what were going to do is were going to have something that is going to be an amazing car, but it wont be the most adventurous version of the Model 3 to begin with, but we will then have the more sort of diﬀerent version of the Model 3 on the Model 3 platform following the initial version, so that we can stay on track for Model 3.

And question on innovation and releasing new features, what did you learned from the dual motor as far as the timing of new releases and how that impacts demand and how you do that going forward. I know you guys are constantly innovating on the car, but does that disrupt demand at all and how do you do that that you are now speciﬁcally during Model years, big advances. Elon Musk This is a problem that we struggle with. Its really tricky because -- we basically have one car with variation. This would be much easier if we had diﬀerent cars. Its tough for us to announce [indiscernible] in advance that there is going to be some new version of the car because then we are like worried about starting near term sales. A lot of people wait to see what it is. So it is a real tricky thing and then we also, it is to forecast the exact demand since we havent [indiscernible] the car. We really have to guess, like how many people want P85D, we have no idea. It turns out a lot, okay, really a lot.

Deepak Ahuja I think one thing in particular that we are working toward is to be sure that we are really ready to meet the production demands at a much higher percentage mix if we announce something new, or an innovative new feature.

Elon Musk Actually [indiscernible] I mean there were a bunch of things that coincided, because we had to expedite - [indiscernible] expedited shipping [indiscernible] make those numbers, we had massive [indiscernible] shipping.

So if you added ZEV credit on top of that it would be, I dont know, 29% or 30% something like that.

Can you just give us a sense of what some of these characteristics and features are that you might have at one point been considering for the initial version that maybe put in place for a later model upgrade.

Getting that right and making sure it works really well and [indiscernible] mechanic, but is a fundamental improvement in utility and aesthetics for cars is extremely .

Should we look at the 40,000 deliveries or maybe its 46,000 if you annualize what you did and add in the delayed Model D? Is that a run rate, and then to get from here to 55,000, where is China now?

It isnt totally necessary but I think and it could be pretty interesting, I could [indiscernible] dealers. Rod Lache Okay. And just one last question I had, you mentioned in your letter that the margin was pressured half by revenue and half by cost factors. The FX part of this was pretty clear but there was a comment in there about deferred autopilot revenue, could you just explain, maybe just elaborate a little bit on what you meant actually in that description of the margin variance? Deepak Ahuja On that particular one, Rod, we announced several features that the autopilot functionality or hardware will deliver. Those features - although the hardware is in the car, some of them will get activated through software releases later this year. And so based on the [indiscernible] aspect of revenue for accounting we had to defer some of that revenue into 2015.",

I just had a question on the delivery guidance, if you adjust that for in this additional in transit vehicles I am just trying to get a sense of whether you feel like thats your best guess on kind of your max production for 2015 because my sense coming to the year around a 1000 a week is you could produce a lot more than that. So I am just getting a sense of - what part of that is demand constraint and what part is production constraint? Elon Musk Well, I mean we are all going to try to do a little better than the 55 number. So were saying 55 plus, but were going to try do a little better than that. But it is - its really dependent on how the X ramp goes that can have quite a – if it happens, okay, later, its going to [indiscernible] that could aﬀect the delivered number quite signiﬁcantly, also when I say delivered, its like we got to also factor in, its like lots of cars in ships… Deepak Ahuja Correct, the gap between production and delivery time. Elon Musk Yes. Deepak Ahuja And then we need to consider there could be disruption during launch of X and so when you are looking at that broad number of 55,000 or [indiscernible] there are things we need to consider through the year what happens. Elon Musk Yes, this 55 is like a number were pretty comfortable with achieving on deliveries and, yes, we are [indiscernible] making a conscious decision to focus on productivity this quarter, not just on ramping production, [indiscernible] production stability, in order to get that eﬃciency, like when we need to be building a ﬁrm foundation before future growth. And if we just in helter-skelter, production ramp, trying to just grow production numbers is really hard to get productivity and that kind of ﬁxes the foundational elements. So the conscious decision this quarter to [indiscernible] improve our core productivity. I mean running at [indiscernible]. Our Fremont plan is pretty big and its hard to park. So we need to just get these productivity improvements in place so we can grow our production volume without proportionately growing headcount. Dan Galves That makes a lot of sense.

Elon Musk Yeah, used cars also aﬀect the capital - [we dont have] [ph] any capital in there really, [indiscernible] turnaround capitals [indiscernible], so its actually like the used car - your margin is actually - its on a ROI basis is extremely good. Deepak Ahuja Right, when the dealers do make lot more gross margin on used cars than new cars, and thats not our intention but the ROI is still really good for us. Elon Musk Yes. But were going to separate that out so that we can see new car gross margin versus used car, service and other things. Deepak Ahuja Which brings up a good point that as we said at - towards the end of our shareholder letter, starting for 2015 ﬁnancials we are going to show our income statement slightly diﬀerently, the automotive revenues and cost of goods sold is truly new-car sales and then we have services and other sections of the income statement that has all these other things including trade-ins and….

We see a lot of similarity between Apple and Tesla, both cos - both companies go for perfection, performance and design. But we dont see Apple making a $30 iPhone. I was just wondering instead of focusing on Model 3, and we just focused on say Model S, say Model X, but made them even better, you just focus on increasing the range to say 400 miles, 450 miles, you already have the roadster which is at 400 miles now, I think that would make Tesla very diﬀerentiated. Elon Musk Not quite 400 miles. The Roadster is sort of more like 360, but close to 400 miles, yes, with the upgrade. Capable of doing LA, San Francisco, but yes. And so, yes, I mean the goal of Tesla, from the beginning, has always been to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport, and to make electric cars happen much faster than what was [indiscernible]. So in order to do that we have to make lots of cars and we need to make them a heck a lot more aﬀordable than S and X are today. Even with the Model 3 though, I mean it is sort of a mass market premium car. Its not – its still premium, but its mass market premium, at 35K, its not a, yes, its above average car. JB Straubel Yes, I think its also not an either/or decision. We deﬁnitely will keep making S and X better and we will keep improving that platform really as much as a technology rollout. So were going in both of those directions. Trip Chowdhry Perfect, thank you.",

So the Gigafactory seems to be making some good progress in terms of construction. Could you provide an update on how the development of the battery supply chain is progressing and perhaps any notable challenges or perhaps positive surprises that have occurred with that process. JB Straubel Sure, I can take that one, this is JB. So far weve been pretty pleased with the supply chain development. Were spending a lot of time visiting more and more of the supply chain partners and understanding and learning about all those diﬀerent markets. That learning is progressing quickly and I think were getting a much more clear picture of exactly how we will achieve the cost reductions weve talked about. I dont want to go into too many speciﬁcs on exactly sort of what weve learned in which places. But I would say there is a lot - maybe more incremental positivity on some of the commodities and some of the ways I think we can secure and procure pricing on some of the larger commodity prices that go into the cell. Andrew Fung Great, and any sense of when you guys may announce additional either suppliers or partners for the Gigafactory. JB Straubel We want to be a little bit cautious about doing that too soon. There is obviously a lot of work going on and discussion with all of those partners, but I think we just - we want to be careful to make sure that all the agreements and decision on the - where that partnership is headed is very clear.

Andrea James Thanks for taking my follow-up, why did you guys promise the Roadster 3.0 this year? Elon Musk Its just a long-standing obligation we have, its not something that economically is a win for us, but its just an obligation to our early adopters of Tesla; we said wed provide a signiﬁcant upgrade to the roadster and thats what were doing. And I think – its okay, I mean its not a big, big thing one way or the other, slightly economically just [unfavorable to] [ph] Tesla. Andrea James And so if I read through on the range communication on the Roadster 3.0 and I just apply that sort of same range gain to the Model S I guess I get a 350 mile to 400 mile range Model S by say 2017. Is that the right, I mean, is that - is all the gains there translatable? Elon Musk Its not simple to put an exact time on it, if you, like 2017, probably not in 2017, at some point, yes. I dont know if that - whether thats 2017, but its not 2017 but it might be say 2019 or 2020 or something like that. [Indiscernible] We can make the Model S go 400 miles today, if we wanted to by just increasing the pack size. Andrea James Great. I mean at the same - I meant at the same cost, same pack cost say give $22,000 pack, will be 400 mile range the next couple of years, but seems that is a bit too aggressive. Elon Musk Next couple years is a bit too aggressive. If you go ﬁve years out, that might be the case. Thats not a prediction, thats just speculation. But Id say its not two years but it might be ﬁve years. Andrea James Okay, and then just I feel like we should just generally ask your thoughts on oil, although its a pretty broad question. So may be just general thoughts on oil, but then more pointedly what it does to the residual value of the cars and then also maybe the corresponding oﬀset with lifting the value of ZEV credits as more gas guzzling cars are sold, I dont know, there you go.
