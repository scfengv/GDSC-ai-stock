"Sure thing. Our first phone question will come from the line of Dan Galves withCredit Suisse.Daniel Galves So if you -- if we assume Model S volume of 50,000 in 2015, deliveries need to average over 14,000 perquarter in Q3 and Q4. What's the biggest challenge to get there? And do you have order rates today thatsupport that level of volume in the back half?Elon R. MuskSure. So yes, I mean, that's about right. I mean, obviously, with the Model X production ramping upquite heavily in Q4, depending upon how that ramp goes -- and obviously, it's difficult to predict that withperfect clarity. But the -- our volume essentially doubles in Q4. So depending upon how the ramp goes,I do want to emphasize that -- sorry, what sometimes people don't totally appreciate is that there areseveral thousand unique parts in the car. And if even one of those parts is not available for any reason,then you cannot ship, you cannot scale production. So -- and so it's essentially the production ramp goesaccording to the unluckiest and worst-performing supplier or part of Tesla. But that said, we do expectto see a significant ramp in Q4 for the X and have something that may be as much as 2x other quartersin Q4. And as far as the demand for that, we do not see that being a problem. There are huge advancedorders for the X, and we see a steady climb in demand for the S.Daniel GalvesOkay, got it. And just as a follow-up, you've improved the Model S a whole lot in the last couple ofyears. Does that make it easier to launch Model X at a high quality level? And does it allow you to moveengineering and design resources towards Model 3 faster than you moved resources to Model X?Elon R. MuskYes. In the case of the X, the X ended up having a lot -- being a lot more different than the S than weoriginally anticipated. So the development took a lot longer, and we were distracted solving all sort ofissues with the S during that time, which made it difficult for us to allocate engineering resources to theX when there were issues to be solved with the S.","Elon R. MuskSure. So if you -- if we assume Model S volume of 50,000 in 2015, deliveries need to average over 14,000 perquarter in Q3 and Q4. What's the biggest challenge to get there? And do you have order rates today thatsupport that level of volume in the back half?"
"So I think we'll do a lot better with the X and we'repaying close attention to some of the things that are different about the X to make sure that they're notan issue, particularly the Falcon Wing door and the second row seats. And yes, so I'm feeling pretty goodabout things. But because that production ramp just scales exponentially, depending upon where thatexponential curve falls across a quarterly boundary, it can actually make quite significant -- make quitea significant effect on the production and deliveries in that quarter. So that's why it's like -- it's easy --it's a lot easier to predict it sort of continuous than if it's discrete with offshore [ph] quarterly cut-offs.But I really think the X is going to be -- it's really going to be a great car. I just drove the latest prototypetoday, and it's like, wow, this is by far the best SUV.","The production ramp just scales exponentially, depending upon where thatexponential curve falls across a quarterly boundary.

"Next question comes from the line of John Lovallo with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.John Lovallo First question is, do you guys earn 4 or 9 ZEV credits per vehicle? And how many vehicles are participatingin your battery swap beta program?Deepak AhujaThe amount of credits, ZEV credits, we earn depends on the size of the pack, different for what we'redoing for the 60 versus 85, and now the new ones at 70. That has been varying over time, the amount ofZEV credits we earn. So I'll need to confirm that before I give the official number here.Elon R. MuskThe ZEV credits thing, it's not like -- I mean, it sort of moves things by like 2%. It's like not supermaterial. So I'm not sure what the point of your question is.John LovalloWell, yes, here's the point of the question is that assuming you guys sell 10,000 vehicles in ZEV states thisyear, that would mean that you would need 400 programs -- sorry, 400 vehicles involved in this batteryswap program if you assume that each of them swapped 25x each, so a minimum of 400 vehicles. So I'mcurious if there are 400 vehicles involved in the battery swap program.Elon R. MuskWell, I mean, you do realize like ZEV credits don't sell for 100 cents on the dollar. They sell for like $0.50or sometimes less. And there are not always customers for the ZEV credits.John LovalloYes, I'm just asking about what you guys are actually earning per vehicle. Okay, and I guess the next...Elon R. MuskIt's not a big deal, yes. And as more of our production goes overseas, obviously, there's no ZEV statesoverseas. And as our sales increase outside of California or Canada, those are not ZEV states. So this islike -- the ZEV stuff is like an increasingly small part of the picture over time.Jeffrey B. StraubelWe have hundreds vehicles in the battery swap pilot program.Elon R. MuskYes.Jeffrey B. StraubelIt's not like 10 or something like that. It's hundreds of vehicles.Elon R. MuskYes. We've steadily increased the invitation list. We've just found like it's -- there just is not a lot ofinterest in people doing pack swap. So we make the invitations, and we get a very small percentage thatactually take us up on the invitation. John LovalloRight. The only point is there's a difference of 5 ZEV credits per vehicle. That was the only point.","The amount of credits, ZEV credits, we earn depends on the size of the pack, different for what we'redoing for the 60 versus 85, and now the new ones at 70.

"Mysecond question would be, my the final question, there is some news report saying that SolarCity hassaid that they're not going to use the 7 kilowatt hour battery. In fact, I think there was a quote from aspokesman -- whether it's true or not, we don't know -- saying that it doesn't make economic sense. Imean, can you guys comment on that, please?Elon R. MuskYes. I mean let me just sort of talk more broadly about the response to the power wall and powerpack because I don't think that's the really the question you should be asking. But the response hasbeen overwhelming, okay, like crazy. The -- In the course of like less than a week, we've had 38,000reservations for the power wall, 2,500 reservations for the power pack. The power pack, it should benoted, typically this is bought by utilities or large industrial companies for heavy industrial work. Sotypically, power pack it's like at least 10 power packs per installation. So if there's 2,500 reservations,it's actually 25,000 power packs. Power wall also is -- we suspect is probably an -- average of number ofpower packs is probably 1.5 to 2 per installation. So 38,000 reservations is more like 50,000 or 60,000actual power walls. So I mean, there's like no way that we could possibly satisfy this demand this year.And we're basically like sold out through the middle of next year in the first week. It was just crazy. Wehad 2,500 requests from companies that want to distribute and install the power wall and power pack.We can't even respond to them. This is -- we have to like triage our response to those who want to be adistributor. So it's like crazy off the hook, yes. And it's just -- it seems to have gone super viral. For thespecific case of SolarCity, what they're referring to is that there's 2 versions of the pack -- of the powerwall. There's the daily cycling version and there's the power backup version. One's energies optimized andone's daily cycling optimized. So the daily cycling optimized one, the economics, it is true in the U.S. withrare exception, are more expensive than utility. So if somebody wants to do a daily cycling basically gooff grid. It's going to be more expensive than being on grid.","Elon Musk: The response hasbeen overwhelming, okay, like crazy. In the course of like less than a week, we've had 38,000reservations for the power wall. And we're basically like sold out through the middle of next year in the first week. So it's like crazy off the hook, yes."
"This doesn't mean that people won't buy itbecause there are people who want to go off grid on principle, or they just want to be independent. Andthat's what the SolarCity comment is about.Jeffrey B. StraubelIt might also be worth noting that SolarCity doesn't yet operate in Europe. the main target applicationfor the daily cycling battery pack was actually -- were several markets not in the continental U.S. Andparticularly, Germany and Australia are very strong markets where it does make economic sense todaybased on the feed-in tariff and the electricity rate structures in those countries. So SolarCity's comments, Ithink, need to be put in the regional context.Elon R. MuskYes. SolarCity is only operating in the U.S. And the power wall, it will be available from SolarCity and fromother installers in both configurations. But if someone is doing a daily cycling application, they're doing itout of -- because they specifically want grid independence. And there's some number of people who willwant to do that, and that's good. And it's also important to appreciate like even to say the power backupsystems, so that you always have power in the event of a power outage, if -- like let's say that appealsto like 2% of households in the U.S. or 1%. Let's say 1%, that's 1 million households. Like is there oneperson in 100 care about having battery backup in the event of utility outage? Probably. We couldn't evensupport a small fraction of that, so -- right now, so it's kind of a moot point.",SolarCity doesn't yet operate in Europe. The main target applicationfor the daily cycling battery pack was actually -- were several markets not in the continental U.S. Germany and Australia are very strong markets where it does make economic sense todaybased on the feed-in tariff and the electricity rate structures.
"Our next question comes from Andrea James with Dougherty and Company.Andrea Susan James Just to build on the Tesla Energy conversation, what are your revenue and gross margin targets on thatbusiness? And how do we look at the 2015 ramp?Elon R. MuskWell, I mean, the gross margin revenue obviously is going to change with time. So when it's low volumemade in Fremont, it will be relatively low margin. Once we get to Gigafactory up and running and -- highvolume and get the economies of scale working, this is just a guess right now, but I mean like maybe it'ssomewhere around 20%. It's not like -- it's like we just don't have enough information to say exactly thatwould be, but probably 20% is a reasonable guess. And then in terms of volume, I mean, we're going totry to scale it as fast as we can -- as the slowest manufacturing constraint. So I mean, it's easier to saywhat's the long term without saying like exactly which quarters it's going to be, and I don't know. But Ithink we'll see demand for stationary storage as measured in sort of megawatt hours or gigawatts hoursto be approximately double that of the car. That's our best guess for long-term demand yet.Andrea Susan JamesHow do you think about your capacity or even your cost per kilowatt hour? Because it's different than acar, right? The duty load is way different for a stationary storage application. So can you educate us a littlebit on how we look at analyzing that business and the difference between that and the energy needs ofthe car business per pack?Elon R. MuskYes, there's 2 applications which are quite different. One is backup power or peaker -- sort of theequivalent -- on a utility scale of like a peaker plant, which is a high-energy application. And then there'sthe daily cycler application. There are different chemistries depending upon which one you have. So thebackup power chemistry is quite similar to the car, which is like a nickel cobalt aluminum cathode. Thedaily cycling control [ph] constituent is nickel manganese cobalt, so there's quite a lot of manganesein there. And there's just one's meant for, call it maybe 60 or 70 cycles per year. And the other one ismeant for daily cycling -- daily deep cycling, so it's 365 cycles a year.","Elon R. Musk: Ithink we'll see demand for stationary storage as measured in sort of megawatt hours or gigawatts hoursto be approximately double that of the car. And then in terms of volume, I mean, we're going totry to scale it as fast as we can -- as the slowest manufacturing constraint."
"And the daily cycler one, I mean, weexpected to be able to daily cycle for something on the order of 15 years. Obviously,, the warranty periodwould be a little bit less than that, but we expect it to be something that's in the kind of 5,000 cycle-range capability, whereas the high-energy pack is more like around the -- maybe depending on how it'sused, anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 cycles. And they have comparable calendar lives. And yes, so that's-- now for the high-energy one, it's important to appreciate that this is actually -- has a lot of interestfrom utilities, because utilities have to maintain these things called peaker plants and for like when there'slike a sharp increase in usage. Like if you can imagine, like the highest-energy day in California on likea hot summer day where there's a heat wave, the energy consumption there is very high compared to apleasant spring night, where nobody's air conditioning or heating is on or for very little and like commerceis not happening and people are asleep and lights are off. That can be a huge delta. Depending upon thesituation, it can be anywhere from like a 5 to 10x difference. So then having a battery pack that can takeout those like very sort of weird sharp peaks like the heat wave day. You could either have a battery packwhich requires basically no maintenance and doesn't require any fuel, and it's going peak shave thosereally troublesome days. Or you could have like a power plant that requires fuel and maintenance, and it'sgot to be -- it's always got to be maintained at it's-- it takes time -- it's not -- you can't just start it up in 3seconds like it -- you've got have notice. The high-energy pack is actually very economically competitive inthose sort of situations. And then the high cycling pack is really great for -- if you've got some sort of windor solar situation, that's where the high cycling one is really great on the utility scale. I should say like the-- we expect most of our stationary storage sales to be at the utility or heavy industrial scale. It's probably-- again, just a guess because it's early days, 5 to 10x more megawatt hours will be deployed at the utilityand heavy industrial scale than at the consumer scale.","The high-energy pack is more like around the -- maybe depending on how it'sused, anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 cycles. And the daily cycler one, weexpected to be able to daily cycle for something on the order of 15 years. Most of our stationary storage sales to be at the utility or heavy industrial scale."
"So the power pack would be the one that's like the heavy duty, the big production sales one, not so much the power wall. The power wall is great, but it'sprobably only 10% to 20% the size of the power pack demand.Jeffrey B. StraubelMaybe one point on the cost structure. There's definitely a lot of commonality in the supply chain and evenin the manufacturing base on how we do the modules themselves for the Tesla Energy products, alongwith the vehicle products. So as we ramp up production on the Tesla Energy products, there definitely arebenefits to the vehicle costs of energy storage from scale and from just generally moving more materialand kilowatt hours through that whole chain. So both businesses benefit each other.Elon R. MuskYes. I mean, clearly given the very high demand that we're seeing for Tesla Energy products, we'reactually trying to figure out if we can go from like our current production target of like 35 gigawatthours at cell level and 50 at the pack level in our Nevada plant to maybe 50% more than that or evenhigher because just the sheer volume of demand here is just staggering. We could easily have the entireGigafactory just do stationary storage.Andrea Susan JamesRight. So you have some capacity. I think you said maybe 15% of your capacity might be reserved forstationary storage. Maybe I've read that in an article somewhere, I'm not sure.Elon R. Musk15 gigawatt hours or 1/3 of the 50 gigawatts hours that's targeted at the pack level, so 15% at the 15gigawatt hours or roughly 30%.Andrea Susan JamesOkay. And you might add now maybe -- you're looking at doing another 50%, In growing the capacity50%, and you have the space, I guess there in Nevada to do that?Elon R. MuskWe do. I don't want to make that a prediction. But that seems like the thing that we should do, so we'reinvestigating that. It seems like the logical thing to do, so we're going to probably try to do that, yes.Because we're fairly confident at this point, that the entire Gigafactory output could just do stationarystorage. It's like wow, okay, we need to make cars, too. So we should try to make the factory bigger.That's like the total logic.",Elon R. Musk: We're trying to figure out if we can go from like our current production target of like 35 gigawatthours at cell level and 50 at the pack level in our Nevada plant to maybe 50% more than that or evenhigher. We could easily have the entireGigafactory just do stationary storage.
"It's not more complicated than that.Andrea Susan JamesBut given the choice between making -- sorry, but given the choice between making a pack for a car andmaking a pack for a stationary storage application, how do you pick which one gets the priority?Elon R. MuskWell, I guess we'd pick cars because we got this whole other plant here in Fremont making cars. So carswould get the priority, yes. That would be the logical priority. And yes, but I mean, it really feels like, man,the stationary storage demand is just nutty like worldwide, it's just crazy.Jeff Evanson Huey, we actually have a question e-mailed in from one of the analysts that is out of the country, so I'llread that -- those next. And it will start with the energy storage questions.So guys, do our years in R&D work in vehicle batteries contribute benefits into this Tesla Energy business?Where have we've drawn some learnings from the vehicle business for Tesla Energy?Elon R. MuskWe've learned a lot about battery packs, I mean obviously, how to make them, and have them last for along time, and work in high temperature ranges and that kind of thing. I think there are a few points ofclarification that should be made with -- regarding the power wall because a lot of people are confusedabout the whole inverter issue. So there's -- the power wall does include a DC to DC inverter. And thatcan interface directly with a solar panel installation. And if somebody has a solar panel installation, theyalready will have a DC to AC inverter for the solar power system. And so no incremental DC to AC inverteris needed. Like in some of the analysis we've seen online by people who think they are experts, they don'tseem to realize that there is a DC to DC inverter, and we haven't been, I guess, quite clear about that,which we need to be. But like if you already have a solar installation, or you're going to get one, the DCto AC inverter is already there. That's an important point concerning the cost of the system. And then theoperating temperature, it's actually capable of operating at a much wider band of temperature. So we'vegot to fix that specification that's stated on the website.Jeffrey B. StraubelIn general, most of the learnings from the car R&D and engineering carry over. I mean part of why we cando this so quickly and...Elon R.","Elon R.

"MuskAnywhere the car works, the pack will work. And the car works pretty much everywhere. So -- in fact itdoes work everywhere, so the pack will work everywhere, obviously.Jeffrey B. StraubelIf anything, it's quite over-engineered for a battery pack that doesn't have to move. It gets mounted onyour wall. So I think that's going to be a great benefit for reliability and just longevity of the pack.Jeff EvansonAnd one for Deepak. Would you be willing to provide any breakdown of the capital -- the CapEx spendingin Q1?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThe CapEx spending was primarily driven by the capacity expansion that we're doing for Model X,including the tooling spend. And then, of course, we are putting in the new paint shop, which is a verysignificant investment. That will be ready in Q3. And then we have also had investments in the Gigafactoryand our sales and service network. That's probably the order in which we've been spending.Jeff EvansonGreat. Thank you.","If anything, it's quite over-engineered for a battery pack that doesn't have to move. So I think that's going to be a great benefit for reliability and just longevity of the pack.

"Next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.Colin LanganI guess first question is staying on the stationary storage topic. I mean, how do you view the -- youmentioned there's 2 different chemistries. How does that work with the Gigafactory? Does that require allseparate lines? Is there any more complexities or all within the same facility? And how do you view yourchemistries versus other competitive options out there? There are other people who are bullish on thingslike zinc and other more basic chemistry?Jeffrey B. StraubelWell, they could still be both be built in the Gigafactory. It doesn't -- we have multiple lines operating inthe Gigafactory, so if one line is building nickel cobalt aluminum chemistry and another is building nickelmanganese cobalt, that still works just fine. A lot of the cell assembly and then the processes that happenafter that are almost identical.Elon R. MuskYes, I mean, they look the same at the module and pack level. You can't really tell by just looking at them.Jeffrey B. StraubelYes.Elon R. MuskIt's just kind of the internal chemical constituents. I mean you can think of like the -- sort of breakdownthe problem like -- the cell is a chemical engineering problem. It's like a little can of chemicals. And thenthe module and pack problem is a mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineeringproblem. And if you have just like a small number of cells, then as an overall engineering problem, it'slike mostly about the cell. But once you get -- have a lot of cells, then it's -- then the intellectual propertychallenge, the intellectual challenge becomes more at the mechanical, electrical and software level, whichis where Tesla does quite well. That's why you don't really see -- like nobody else has like -- has a packlike ours. There -- the cells are relatively generic, but the module and pack is not.Jeffrey B. StraubelYes. And we've looked at pretty much every chemistry couple that could possibly be relevant for this.We're confident what we're using is going to be the best. But if there's something better, we can alsoadjust and change over time. So there's a lot of flexibility.Elon R. MuskYes, I mean I'm not sure if like the exact -- the right analogy would be, but like if you had like a laptopand it's like you could say, ""Whoa, a laptop's really just like Intel CPU and some Micron DRAM chips."" Like,big deal.","Elon R. MuskYes, I mean, they look the same at the module and pack level. You can't really tell by just looking at them. We're confident what we're using is going to be the best. But if there's something better, we can alsoadjust and change over time."
"What's any computer company actually doing? They're doing a lot.Colin LanganSo what do you view your competitive edge? So it sounds like you think it's the software and electronicintegration, the competitive advantage? Because in your presentation, you actually mentioned youencourage other companies that build -- to enter the market as well. Elon R. MuskYes. And I think we are -- in terms of the electrical engineering, the mechanical, the software and theoverall aesthetics and just having something that really just works and is easy for consumers and utilitiesand large industrial applications to just order and it just works, and it's just there as a fully integratedsystem. That's what's the value that Tesla is adding.Jeffrey B. StraubelI think there's also a substantial benefit to the track record of the automotive fleet. That's something thata lot of the sort of newer start-up companies or different technologies in the space really struggled with,especially in the utility application, where you need to be sure that it's going to work for 15-plus years.And we have a sense of scale and have a great track record on the vehicle fleet that you can really pullfrom data -- and pull data from and understand how it's going to work.Elon R. MuskI shouldn't say like we're like wedded to a particular chemistry or anything like that. We just want to usethe best chemistry. Like whatever little can that contains a cathode, an anode, a separator and electrolyte,whatever that -- the best constituents of that can are -- that's what we will want to use. So we'd love itif somebody could come up with a better internal chemistry for the cell. But it's worth noting like nobodyhas sent us anything, a sample cell, that's better than the cell we're producing. So -- or that -- somethingthat we will produce in the Gigafactory. So we'd love it if somebody would do that. They just haven't.And so it's like all these things which are big on promise and short on delivery when it comes to batterychemistry. And it's just a real hard problem. And then hardly a week goes by that there's not some allegedbreakthrough in batteries. But what they'll do is they'll cite the power, but not the energy. Or they'll forgetto mention that it will only last 50 cycles or uses incredibly exotic raw materials...Jeffrey B. StraubelOr one component out of the battery pulled separately.Elon R. MuskYes, exactly.","Elon R. Musk: We just want to usethe best chemistry. Like whatever little can that contains a cathode, an anode, a separator and electrolyte,whatever that can are. So we'd love itif somebody could come up with a better internal chemistry for the cell."
"It's just not like a -- it's not the full picture. So it's not like we don't want a better chemistryto exist than what we're using. We'd love it if there was such a thing. And I'm sure there will beimprovements over time, and we'll implement them as soon as they are remotely production-ready.Colin LanganJust one last final of question. Any color on the -- on a financial question, other expenses is up quite a bit.It was $22.3 million, What was really just driving that in the quarter?Deepak AhujaYes, that was essentially revaluation of primarily our foreign currencies that we had at the end of thequarter. The dollar was particularly strong against foreign currencies there, and it's also, in most cases,unrealized losses. So as the currency moves in Q2 in different directions, that could have an impact aswell, a positive impact is what I mean.Colin Langan Okay. So we should kind of consider most of it as onetime in nature because of FX, balance sheet effect[ph]?Deepak AhujaYes, they're not related directly to operations. It's simply the revaluation of our currencies into company'sitems.","It's not like we don't want a better chemistryto exist than what we're using. We'd love it if there was such a thing.

"Next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheA couple questions on stationary storage first. One is it seems like utilities move quite a bit slower thanother markets. So I was wondering when you are thinking about the expectations for the trajectory ofgrowth, if you had the capacity today, how long would do you think it would take for you to get to that15 gigawatt hours? Also related to this business, it seems like you're using third parties for most of thedistribution, installation. So if you achieved maybe a 20% gross margin, can you pass along any thoughtson how we should we be thinking in terms of SG&A is allocated?Elon R. MuskI think it's pretty early days to -- I mean, we're being super-speculative at this point. So it's...Jeffrey B. StraubelYes. Maybe one point on the distributors. We're only focusing on that approach for power wall in most case-- in most cases. So with utilities, we're building those relationships directly. That's not something thatis really effective to go through a distribution channel, and it's something we have also been doing for anumber of years. It didn't just start last Thursday. And we've built these relationships partially throughvehicle infrastructure and charging questions and back and forth, supercharging as well. So there'sactually quite a lot of trust built between Tesla and many of the utility companies, which is very helpful togrow that business faster.Rod Avraham LacheAnd just a clarification on the comment about the fact that a DC/AC inverter is already there for solar.Does the fact that it needs be bidirectional change the nature of the cost? Or not really?Jeffrey B. StraubelNo, not in most cases because if you have already solar, typically, the energy to charge the battery cancome from the solar panel. So I think maybe one way to think of it is, if the battery pack, the power wall,with its internal DC to DC converter, can act much like a solar panel. It can match voltage with the solarpanel array and it can feed power back into that. So the existing inverter doesn't particularly see a bigchange.Rod Avraham LacheOkay, got it. On the auto business, do you have any preliminary expectations on the mix of the 70Dversus 85? Any thoughts on how that affects margins? And lastly, a question for Deepak.","If you had the capacity today, how long would do you think it would take for you to get to that15 gigawatt hours?

So if you achieved maybe a 20% gross margin, can you pass along any thoughts on how we should be thinking in terms of SG&A is allocated?"
"In the past,we were able to look at your supplemental information on leasing where you disclose the value of theleases delivered and the value that you're booking this at on the balance sheet, which is presumably your cost. And it sort of approximated your gross margins, but this quarter, when you do the math, the impliedmargins were something like 44%, not like 29%, 30%. Is there something unusual there?Deepak AhujaI'll answer the second one. No, there's nothing unusual in those numbers as the overall. What you'reseeing in the supplemental information is the new cars we've delivered. What's coming through ultimatelyis the cumulative impact of all the leasing that we have done. But to my knowledge, there's nothing elseunusual.Rod Avraham LacheOkay. It seems like a pretty high margin, though, when you look at it that way. Anything on the mix, 70Dversus 85?Elon R. MuskI mean, it's still pretty early to be predicting mix because you have to distinguish between what's sort ofinitial demand versus sustained demand. So I mean, it looks like there may be -- going to be comparablenumber of 70s versus 85s. But it's -- this is difficult to -- this is extrapolating on very little information.And yes, I think a key point I should make before this call ends is we're really optimizing, at this pointgoing forward, we're going to be optimizing for the operational efficiency of the company as opposed tospecific quarters. This is -- I feel like what we've done in the past, where we've really had to scramble atthe end of quarters and sometimes have not a great customer experience at the end of quarters. It's notreally the right thing for the company. And so we're going to be operating more for sort of steady-stateefficiency. And that means the quarterly fluctuations could be a little higher, but in the long term, it will bebetter. So that's an important consideration. Also sort of unlike other car companies, Tesla sales are onlyrecognized when they arrive at the end customer and we've received payment and all the regulatory docshave been processed and all that. So our sales are always kind of true -- they're always true sales. They'renot sales to the channel. Whereas the other car companies are -- they're sales to the channel. So it'spossible to sort of -- for them to make numbers work, where they're selling to their channel as opposed toend customers.","In the past,we were able to look at your supplemental information on leasing where you disclose the value of theleases delivered and the value that you're booking this at on the balance sheet. And it sort of approximated your gross margins, but this quarter, when you do the math, the impliedmargins were something like 44%, not like 29%, 30%. Is there something unusual there?Deepak AhujaI'll answer the second one. No, there's nothing unusual in those numbers as the overall. What you'reseeing in the supplemental information is the new cars we've delivered."
"In our case, it's always end customers. And -- as we're shipping to Asia and Europe andacross the U.S., it's fairly easy for there to be a plus/minus 5% difference in deliveries just due to logisticsissues. So it's not a huge variation, plus/minus 5%, but that's kind of like the -- if a ship is late or early,it can affect the -- there could be 500 cars that are affected, and then that's 5%, so -- which we've seenin the past. So that's an important thing to bear in mind. The number that's much more controllable forus is the production number. So that's -- our production predictions, I think, are, for the vehicles, are -- atleast for the Model S, not so much for a new vehicle but for an existing vehicle, our production predictionsare a lot more controllable. And then, as I think people have similar drives [ph], demand is different fromproduction. Like there's -- our cars are almost all ordered in advance. So we really don't see any demandissue, but you can sort of see that by the delivery times of the cars on our website. So it's like sometimespeople will interpret a quarterly delivery number as somehow being related to demand. This is not thecase. This is usually related to like just that's how many -- we produced a certain number, and then wewere able to deliver a certain number in the quarter, and so -- and there's so much cars on ships or ontrains or on trucks. And so that's -- because Tesla is different from other car companies, applying theother car companies' template can lead to incorrect conclusions about Tesla. Is this making sense, I mean,or [indiscernible]?Rod Avraham LacheYes, it makes sense.Elon R. Musk Okay.Deepak AhujaYes, and to add to what Elon said, to be more efficient operationally, we are shipping more by trainrather than trucks. It's more cost efficient and creates less damage to the car, gives a better customerexperience. So we are taking all these actions.Rod Avraham LacheI guess my question is more geared to trying to assess the effect on ASPs and margins as you're changingthe mix a little bit. But I appreciate that.Elon R. MuskYes, I -- to sort of answer your question on margins, I think there's 2 things that are happening.","Elon R. MuskYes, I -- to sort of answer your question on margins, I think there's 2 things that are happening. The number that's much more controllable forus is the production number.

"Theaverage sales price is going to decline a little bit, but the -- but our costs are improving as well. So -- andwe see that more or less netting out, so that efficiency improvements offset approximately any averageselling price change.Deepak AhujaAnd if in the process we are growing the market, which we truly are by hitting the right sweet spot,then we are doing the right thing with the 70D. And the 70D has a higher gross margin than the 60,for example. And 60 was just not hitting the market. It just didn't have the right attributes that ourcustomers like. It was a low take rate. And we've got a product which is far more compelling and muchmore competitive with other cars.","Theaverage sales price is going to decline a little bit, but the -- but our costs are improving as well.

"Our next phone question will come from the line of Colin Rusch with Northland Capital Markets.Colin William RuschAs you look at the growth of the organization, the integrity of the culture and the workforce, I know thatyour employees are extremely motivated. But could you talk about, as you grow, how that's growing andchanging and what you're doing to maintain that integrity as we go forward?Elon R. MuskI mean, it is tricky, as companies grow, to maintain a consistent culture. I think we're doing okay. I thinkas measured, yes, relative to most companies. But we do need to get people to think differently and havean expectation of innovation. And I mean, I think we're doing okay on that front.Jeffrey B. StraubelYes, I think having a general mix of people that have been here for a very long time and have seenmultiple programs and seen the company when it was even much smaller than today and more scrappyand had to go through even tighter financial difficult launches, things like that, really helps maintain thatculture. And we try and pair different managers up with new groups so that, that culture sort of infusesthroughout.Elon R. Musk Yes. And our growth rate, like this year, personnel-wise is sort of, I won't say leveled off, because it's stillfairly significant, but it's like our net personnel growth this year will probably be 20% to 30%, which is Ithink a manageable number for kind of integrating with people that already have kind of the Tesla culture.And I think it's also -- it's a pretty big improvement in productivity. Because we're looking at, let's call it,like if it's up at the upper end of that 30% personnel increase, but 100% increase in vehicle volume. So Ithink that's a pretty good indicator of productivity improvements, just like how many people do we haveand how many cars are we making.Colin William RuschGood. And the second question is really around some of the choices that you made with the batteryproduct and why choosing 10 kW and the size. 220 pound is actually pretty hefty for a garage wall. Andthen also the battery management system.","Elon R. Musk: It is tricky, as companies grow, to maintain a consistent culture. I think we're doing okay. But we do need to get people to think differently and havean expectation of innovation. And I mean, I thinkWe're doing alright on that front."
"I think there's a lot of confusion around where it's locatedand what the real functionality is, as you look at it interfacing with utilities and the signals that you getfrom the market, in terms of looking at demand trying to offset demand response and some of the otheradvanced functionalities that are going to be able to be monetized in business models with the product.Can you just clarify where that BMS system is, where it resides and who owns that technology, and whyyou guys made those choices along with the weight and size choices?Jeffrey B. StraubelSome of the different revenue streams you're talking about are kind of mixed between power pack andpower wall. The BMS system lives inside the battery pack in both cases. But with the power pack, inthe more utility-sized installations, there, we often will have sort of a site master computer or mastercontroller that controls multiple power packs. And that site controller is what then interfaces to theutility or maybe a commercial customer to sort of run the scheduled charge and discharge that wouldbe appropriate for a given application. On the power wall, it's a bit of a different situation. Still, the BMSlives inside the battery pack. But in some cases, the inverter may be the system that's deciding how tomanage energy in the overall house, and that can depend on which type of inverter we're using and howthat works. And in terms of the size, we really -- for power wall again, we optimized the size around whatwas the most common photovoltaic size and also what we felt was kind of the smallest modular incrementfor backup. And it's pretty key to note here that you can install multiple power walls together. So having10 kilowatt hours doesn't mean that you can't very easily put in 20 or 30 or 40. And in many cases, Ithink people will, to have the backup kind of matching that they want to see. But we felt 10 kilowatt hourswas the lowest kind of common element. And if you go smaller than that, you start to run into worseeconomies of scale and more the system that's not related to storage.Jeff EvansonHuey, before we go to the next question, I just wanted to give everybody a status update. A lot ofimportant things to talk about on this call, but we-are 50 minutes into the call and we still have 7 callers inqueue.","There's a lot of confusion around where that BMS system is, where it resides and who owns that technology.

"Our next phone question will come from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionFirst question, on the Model S and the release candidates. How many release candidates have youproduced? What have been some of the issues with the recent production? And why the slight -- am Iseeing a slight further delay by [indiscernible] late 3Q from what I thought was kind of more of an Augusttime horizon for initial deliveries? Anything that kind of might be behind that you'd highlight?Elon R. Musk I think we're past almost sort of answering super-detailed questions about the X ramp. But look, the thingthat really matters is not like when do the first deliveries of the X occur, but rather when do significantdeliveries of the X occur. And for the S, we had quite a long ramp from -- we had like 6 months fromthe very first deliveries to significant volume. We're trying to compress that to maybe like 2 monthsor 3 months for -- at most, cut that in half or more for the X. And we want to make sure we really aredelivering a product that has been thoroughly validated in hot and cold weather and through millions ofmiles of travel and everything. So it would be easy for us to kind of do some initial deliveries in August,that would be pretty easy. But then -- like we don't want to have like -- if we have had door handle issues,like people are aware of that with the S. They don't want to have Falcon Wing door issues with the X. Wewant to iron everything out, make sure it's good and then deliver at high volume. So effectively, we'dcreate like a captive fleet and iron out the issues with that captive fleet. They're quite big, several hundredvehicles basically. And maybe that addresses your release candidate question. And just make sure thatthose several hundred vehicles really work well in all circumstances before we start delivering cars enmasse. Because we're going to go from just 1 of our cars to like 1,000 a week pretty fast.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionOkay. And just a second question, in the interest of time, and final question. Apple has kind of still,unofficially perhaps, been making inroads into building up its vehicle engineering and transportationcapabilities, according to a lot of sources, and making investments both in physical and human capital.","Elon R.

"Areyou starting to feel a greater sense of competition with Silicon Valley parties versus your ability to attractand retain key software and automotive engineering talent? And if Apple were to get into the electric carbusiness, would you see this as a positive for broader consumer acceptance of electric vehicles?Elon R. MuskActually, I certainly hope Apple gets into the car business. That would be great. But no, we're not reallyseeing significant attrition of engineers to Apple for anything, car or otherwise. And actually, anyone canlike figure this out by just going on LinkedIn. LinkedIn can produce statistics on what the relative flowof people is from one company to another. And I think it's like, something like 5 -- if you look at like thetrailing 12 months, I think Tesla's recruited 5x as many people from Apple as Apple has recruited fromTesla. So it's like some fairly high number.","Elon Musk: We're not really seeing significant attrition of engineers to Apple for anything, car or otherwise.

"Our next phone question will come from Brian Johnson with Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonJust really want to ask about the balance between stationary and automotive. It's not unusual for growthcompanies to change their focus as they evolve. I think at least one of the stories around PayPal, itwas going to be a cryptographic PDA-focused company, until it refocused perhaps through your help,Elon, on web-based payments. It just -- I'm hearing you talk about stationary storage as being able toramp faster perhaps, although you didn't [ph] answer this kind of maybe with a lower CapEx and OpExratio than the auto business. Yet at the same time, auto takes a lot of capital, takes a lot of OpEx. AndSergio Marchionne pointed out there's a lot of value-destroying capital spent in the legacy industry. Is itconceivable that instead of say being 70/30 auto/batteries, it could go the other way?Elon R. MuskIt's possible. I mean, this is -- we're, like, really super in guesswork territory here. All we know rightnow is like we have demand, like, well in excess of our production ramp. So we know like, right now, Ithink we should work on is trying to increase our production ramp, not trying to increase demand. So that's kind of like the only thing we know for sure right now. And then if you look really long-term what'sthe total energy -- like how many battery -- what's the total terawatt hours of installation -- of batteryinstallation that's needed to go to a fully renewable global economy taking into account transportation,current electrical needs, full electrification of transport, electrification of all heating and cooling, and thenthe current industrial uses and commercial uses of electricity like to go fully electric -- transport is abouthalf the size of everything else. That was sort of our global macro calculations. So ultimately, we thinkthings will get there, it could take a long time, but that's kind of where we think things will end up. Andyes, that's where we get to like the kind of 2 billion power pack number. Whether it's made by Tesla orother companies or some combination, that's kind of the number you need to get to go fully electric. Butwhere things -- how things track between now and then, it's difficult to predict.Brian Arthur JohnsonIn terms of the ROIC, would you be thinking that stationary could be a better ROIC business than saymass market or mass affluent automotive?Elon R.","Elon R.

"MuskIt might. I mean, I'd -- it would be nice to get like maybe a couple of quarters of experience after makingthe big announcement to really -- before we -- our degree of uncertainty will diminish quite substantiallywith each passing month. Certainly a year from now, we'd have -- we're going to have like I think a reallygood idea of it. But it's like super-speculative at this point. But we just know that like, man, there's just noway we can meet the demand that we're seeing right now. And so we've got to scale stationary storage asfast as possible.Brian Arthur JohnsonAnd you mentioned last time that some CapEx was going to product development, in the shareholders'letter, for Model 3 -- Model 3 wasn't in this. Does that mean you might be delaying some Model 3investments? Or just the other things kind of swamp it?Elon R. MuskIt's just the other things kind of swamp it. We need to make sure -- we're doing quite a bit of advancedwork on Model 3, but this just doesn't amount to a lot of CapEx.Deepak AhujaAnd just to clarify, Model 3 spend in the initial stages is more engineering spend.Elon R. MuskIt's like, basically, design studio.Deepak AhujaExactly.Elon R. MuskLike very early engineering prototypes. It's just not very -- it's just not very cash-intensive.Deepak Ahuja Yes. CapEx comes at a later stage when you have all the designs finalized, you're kicking off tooling again[ph].Elon R. MuskYes.Deepak AhujaSo we are in the early stages as to be expected at this point in time.Elon R. MuskYes.Jeff EvansonWell, Brian, you might want to ask the follow-up, does this impact our Model 3 timing, so I'll throw thatout.Brian Arthur JohnsonWell, go ahead.Elon R. MuskWell, I mean, we are hoping to show off the Model 3 in approximately March of next year. Again, don'tsuper hold me to that month, but that's like -- that's our aspiration, and then be in production with Model3 in the -- I'd like to say mid, but probably closer to the late 2017 time frame. Late 2017 is probably morerealistic.Brian Arthur JohnsonOkay. And in the meantime, the Gigafactory sounds like it may be ramping up faster.

"Our next question will come from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.Ryan J. Brinkman I have a 2-part question on cash. Firstly, on the last call, you mentioned reaching free cash flow positivein 4Q this year. I'm just wondering, with 1Q behind you, how you think you're tracking relative to thatgoal? And then secondly, if you could perhaps comment on your capitalization and liquidity overall and thepotential for, or desirability of, raising any additional capital.Deepak AhujaWe do expect to be free cash flow positive in Q4, that doesn't change. And as we go along, clearly, we areoptimizing for efficiency, which results in increase of our finished goods inventory. It makes sense for usto then establish some asset pipelines of credit, which is backed by our finished goods inventory or rawmaterials. So we'll take those actions to make sure we have a solid balance sheet.Elon R. MuskYes, I mean I think it's -- yes, I think things are looking pretty good for Q4. But it's hard to predict fullquarter exactly because the whole quarterly boundary and where does the sort of the sort of exponentialramp of production fall exactly on that start of Q4 boundary. But it's -- I think it's extremely likely thatthere's -- that cash flow is really good at the end of Q4.","On the last call, you mentioned reaching free cash flow positivein 4Q this year.

"Our next phone question will come from the line of Trip Chowdry with Global Equities Research.Trip ChowdhryA quick question, 2 quick questions. First is regarding the residences which may not have the solar panels,and, say, that residence goes and buys 2 power walls. Does that customer have to buy 2 inverters or 1inverter is sufficient for as many power walls the customer buys?Elon R. MuskIt's basically whatever the capability of that inverter is. So typically the inverter would be capable ofhandling -- 1 inverter is probably capable of handling, depending on the situation, up to maybe 4 or 5power walls.Trip ChowdhryThe second question I had was regarding the double-back tour you had in 10 cities, and that was -- ourresearch indicated that it was a very successful event with the reservations and orders really skyrocketing.And I think it was only in Canada and U.S.A. Wondering if you could expand that tour to other continents?Elon R. MuskYes, absolutely. I mean, we have actually -- we just did a big thing in Europe through Germany. And thereactually, I think, there is like quite a big a tour happening from Slovenia, I think, through most of Europe.So there's actually quite a lot happening. Actually, our sales in Europe lately have been pretty, prettygreat. I mean, like, yes, really strong.Deepak AhujaAnd we did the tour in Germany, too -- in Europe, too, sorry, with your motor.Elon R. Musk Yes. So the 85D has been a big hit in Europe.Trip ChowdhryIf I can ask one last question. I was at your Lathrop factory the other day. And there was some interestingconstruction happening behind it, with huge metallic frames being installed. What kind of production couldbe happening there? And it seems like the factory size has increased almost 40%. And what is happeningthere? Any thoughts you can share with us? And that's all for me.Elon R. MuskYes, we're establishing a big casting foundry and machining facility there. And yes, that's intended tosupport activity in Fremont.

"Our next phone question will come from the line of Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultJust wanted to build on, I think, Ryan Brinkman's question, on the fourth quarter cash flow guidance. Doesthat include income from those warehouse facilities to offset leased vehicles? Or is that exclusive of that?Deepak AhujaWell, our projection, as Elon said, was the end of the quarter, as we ramp up production, we should befree cash flow positive on a pure sense. But frankly, our operations should be looked at without the impactof leasing. And that's a purer measure of operations, which is a lower threshold, I get it, but that's aunique or distinct decision we've made to be in that business.Jeff EvansonHold on a second, Pat. Deepak, do you want to explain about the classification of cash inflows within thestatement of cash flows?Deepak AhujaSure. Yes, if you look at our Q1 cash flows, for example, we received $155 million from our, either thewarehouse line or banking partners related to our leasing business. But that cash flow does not show upas an offset in our cash flow from operations. It shows up in our financing activities. So our cash flow fromoperations shows up $131 million negative. But if you offset that against the $155 million that we receivedon the leasing business, we were slightly better than breakeven purely on an operations basis. And so ourreal cash flow in Q1 was driven by the strong CapEx spend ahead of the Model X launches, the way wetend to look at the business internally.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultOkay, I appreciate that clarification. The other quick question I had is just I was a little surprised by the-- I think you guys had obviously very good gross margins this quarter relative to some of the headwindsthat you were facing. And I guess I was surprised to see that x ZEV, they go from 26 to 25. With someof the increases in pricing that you're putting through and some of the components that you're buyingoutside of the U.S. with a stronger dollar now, which -- where there was a little bit of a lag, I understand.I -- it just -- that seemed a bit conservative, and I don't know, maybe it ties back into Rod's earlier pointabout mix, but I guess that was one area that I was a little surprised.","Deepak, do you want to explain about the classification of cash inflows within thestatement of cash flows?Deepak AhujaSure.

"Deepak AhujaSo just to clarify, the price increase that we've announced is not going to help us in Q2 given our book ofbusiness. It's going to primarily affect us in Q3.Elon R. MuskYes.Deepak AhujaAnd also in April, for most of April, the dollar was pretty strong. It's just trended in the last week or 10days or so, and we were continuing to deliver cars. So that strong dollar impact does roll over sequentiallyinto Q2 for us despite the lag effect of good news from a strong dollar. And as we said in the letter, wefully expect the mix impact to be offset by cost reductions that we will achieve. So it's really related to FXthat we see the sequential drop.Elon R. MuskYes. The FX was really -- that was really a tricky thing to deal with. We had a quite strong European sales.And then the FX impact was quite significant. So obviously, if you've got a car that is, like let's say, 25%gross margin, and you've got -- and you see a 20% change in currency, it's like, wow, okay? That's notsuper easy to make up that difference.Deepak AhujaYes. And to your point, and maybe this is a broader comment to make, that as we look at our Q1 non-GAAP loss that we have of $45 million, a big chunk or most of it could be attributed to the dollar strengththat has happened over the last 6 months. As we've indicated, our Q1 top line came down by about 3percentage points. And then we had the $22 million unrealized losses, from currency. You combine those2, and there's an offset in gross margin due to lower cost of parts we buy in foreign currencies. Butconsider this whole mix and you can see the foreign currency change over the last 6 months can explainmost of the losses we had in Q1.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultAnd, yes, maybe just like that last piece is kind of interesting. How much are you able to take advantageof that natural hedge you just described, right? Because you are buying components in currencies thathave also depreciated, right? Batteries are one obvious thing. I'm sure you're sourcing a lot of stuff inMexico. Are you close to optimizing that? Or is that something that can be kind of exercised more?Elon R.","The price increase that we've announced is not going to help us in Q2 given our book ofbusiness. It's going to primarily affect us inQ3. And as we said in the letter, wefully expect the mix impact to be offset by cost reductions. So it's really related to FXthat we see the sequential drop."
"MuskFor better or worse, one can look at it as a pro or con depending on the situation, basically, about 60%of the car, maybe a little more than 60%, is U.S. and Canada. So it would -- we may have -- we certainlyhave, like, lots of, say, European companies that supply us, but they will supply us from plants in the U.S.or Canada or sometimes Mexico. So that's -- this really is a North American built car, like not -- for real.So it's like, as Deepak is saying, it's slightly helpful if the dollar strengthens relative to the yen. But then,since we have, like, quite strong European sales, this is -- I think it's like 5% of our parts or somethingcome from Europe. It's pretty low.Deepak Ahuja Right.Elon R. MuskSo if our sales are 30% in Europe, then obviously there's not as much an offset as one would like. Iactually thought it would be higher than that. But it's like -- because I'm looking at the names of thesuppliers, but not -- what matters is where -- not the name of the supplier. If their headquarter's inGermany, but where is the plant? So yes. I've got to go into another meeting, so if there are...","Elon R. Musk: About 60%of the car, maybe a little more than 60%, is U.S. and Canada.

"Our next question will come from the line of Brad Erickson with Pacific Crest Securities.Bradley D. EricksonJust a quick follow-up from the last one on the automotive gross margins. I think just x currency, can youjust quickly talk maybe a couple of examples where you're looking to remove more costs from the caritself? I think we can all kind of appreciate there's continued scale advantages over time. But maybe if youcould talk about other cost savings opportunities we should be thinking about with both the S and the X,and sort of what inning we're in, in terms of achieving those savings?Elon R. MuskYes, a big factor is labor hours per vehicle. That has steadily improved. It was sort of quite bad in Q4,particularly with the P85 ramp, P85D ramp. We've made good progress on that in Q1, we'll continue tomake good progress on that through the rest of the year. So it's like labor and like direct overhead in thefactory.Deepak AhujaYes, we're focused across every line item of our COGS, so material cost reductions, freight, both inbound-- we spoke a little bit about outbound freight efficiencies...Elon R. MuskYes, we had a lot of expediting.Deepak AhujaYes.Elon R. MuskBecause you know there was that big port strike was super-unhelpful. That also hurt pretty badly. It waslike the, I think, the worst port strike of the 21st century. And so we're also soldiering through that. So wehad like -- had to airfreight a ton of stuff...Deepak AhujaExactly right.Elon R. MuskWhile everyone else was simultaneously trying to airfreight a bunch of stuff. Deepak AhujaThat's right. It cost us $7 million.Elon R. MuskYes. Just airfreight, yes. So like well, so cutting back on airfreight is really helpful, direct labor hours. The-- just...Deepak AhujaWe continue with several engineering and promotional actions on material costs. It's a long list, notappropriate to go through. But yes, as a company, I think we are focused on Model X. But S is alsocertainly improving gross margin there, it's part of our priorities.Elon R.

Baird.Benjamin Joseph KalloThis is Ben, very quickly, you mentioned the Gigafactory and then a lot of talk about stationary storageand increasing the size of the Gigafactory. Does that change in any way that you're looking at partnershipsand bringing partnerships in, and maybe an update on timing there? And then, Elon, you talked abouthaving a fleet of a couple hundred X to get out and test. And you mentioned Model 3 showing it nextMarch. When should we see the Model X in it's final version?Jeffrey B. StraubelWell, no particular change to the partnership model for the Gigafactory. I think as Elon said, it's early dayson trying to make some of those changes in direction. But largely, it's just a bigger scope of opportunityfor a lot of the people we're already working with. And it is continuing to go well. We're actually beginningto hire operational people at the Gigafactory and beginning to staff up on that ahead of -- starting to trainand then ramp up production of the stationary products early next year.Benjamin Joseph KalloJust on the Model X, when we could see that?Jeff EvansonElon, do you want to talk about Model X? We've had a number of questions here from investors and Ben'squestion here about when you'll be able to configure Model X online, when we'll show that to the public,how that will actually deploy.Elon R. MuskYes. Probably 3 months from now -- no, actually, I'm sorry. We're in May, so it's like -- this is probably Julyis when we'll ask people to do the configuration. And it will be very similar to the S, like, it's not going to be super -- no big surprises there. It's very similar to the S. And yes, we certainly have a lot of customerswho have been waiting a long time. So there will be quite the need to get the car.Benjamin Joseph KalloGood, we look forward to that.Elon R. MuskYes, I think this is really a great car. I mean, it's like -- because it has like such a low center of mass. Imean, it handles like a sports car even though it's an SUV, with battery packs in the oil pan. And it's gotincredible acceleration because there's like basically a performance version of it like there is for the P85D.The performance is just surreal.","Elon R.
