Whatopportunities do you see from monetizing the installed base other than via FSD?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorRight now, by far, FSD is just overwhelmingly the most important thing. I think the upgrading ofthe ﬂeet to Full-Self Driving, especially with an over-the-air software update, I mean, may go downas the biggest asset value increase in history as a step change. Maybe there's something bigger, butit certainly would be one of the biggest -- I can't think of anything bigger. So overnight, 1 million --depending exactly on when it happens and when it's allowed in various regulatory jurisdictions,you'd have like, I don't know, at least a few million cars suddenly becoming 5x more valuable orsomething like that, something like 5x higher utility. They go from like 12 hours a week of utility,something like that, that's hours of use, to 60, something like that. So everything else is pretty smallby comparison.Now when things do become Full-Self Driving, so what are people going to do in the car? Well, Iguess they're probably going to want to do productivity and entertainment of some kind. Watchmovies, play games and do work. That's in the future. Yes. We're already putting some games andstuff on the car, just for fun.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, we have been experimenting on that. And so FSD remains, by far and away, the biggestopportunity in the near term. But we're putting the plumbing in place to be ready to scale otherareas when the time is right. So premium connectivity subscription is something that we've put inplace. And the ability to upgrade your vehicle through the app, for example, on Acceleration Boost,or upgrading a Standard Range Model 3 to a Standard Plus, adding rear-heated seats. So these arethings that we have, and we're continuing to get feedback from the ﬁeld and other things that wecan launch, and we'll trickle those in with time.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. But they're all very tiny compared with like the step change to Full Self-Driving, dependingupon how you calculate it, is probably worth at least $100,000 per car.

And now we can jump straight into questions from Say Technologies.The ﬁrst question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from beingthe market share leader in solar?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So we're actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year. And we hadour best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4. So we do expect to become the market share leader insolar and then go far beyond it. It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had todevote the whole company to Model 3 production and building. And so we actually basically takethe whole company, including a lot of people that were on solar, and have them work on cars. Butnow we got a little more bandwidth, we're putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growingrapidly. So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOAnother really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure,which then allows us to have industry-leading pricing. And so that's something that we'veaccomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the place that it needs to be.And as Elon mentioned, this is a really important part with industry-leading pricing to become theleader in the space.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And actually, an important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwalland the Tesla retroﬁt solar and Tesla roof. And we're conﬁdent we'll have excellent integration --excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar, whether it's retroﬁt or the Tesla SolarglassRoof before the end of the year.So it's really -- I think we've got a good strategy. As Zach mentioned, we're focused on reducing theamount of time and the complexity of the install, and we're making great progress in that regard.And I think we'll have something that's really dialed in this year.",

As I'm saying, it's not remarkable at all for the car tocompletely drive you from one location to another through a series of complex intersections. It'snow about just improving the corner case reliability and getting it to 99.9999% reliable with respectto an accident.Basically, we need to get it to better than human by a factor of at least 100% or 200%.

And really, as we transition each net to video, the performancesbecome exceptional.So this is like a hot thing. The video -- the labeling software that we work for, video labeling,making that better has a huge effect on the efﬁciency of labeling. And then, of course, the holy grailis auto labeling. So we're putting a lot of work into having the labeling tool be more efﬁcient whenused by a person as well as enabling auto labeling where we can.Dojo is a sort of training supercomputer. We believe it will be -- we think it may be the best neuralnet training computer in the world by possibly an order of magnitude. So it is a whole thing in andof itself. And this is something we can offer potentially as a service. So some of the others needneural net training. We're not trying to keep it to ourselves.So I think there could be a whole line of business in and of itself, and then, of course, for trainingvast amounts video data and getting the reliability from, say, 100% to 200% better than averagehuman to 2,000% better than average human.

The ﬁrst question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet topurchase or experience FSD despite most vehicles having all the necessary hardware. What leverscould you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage? For example, could youconsider offering FSD as a premium subscription?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards theend of this year. I should say it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as, in our view, buyingFSD is an investment in the future. And we are conﬁdent that it is an investment that will pay off tothe consumer and to the beneﬁt of the consumer. In my opinion, buying FSD option is somethingpeople will not regret doing.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOI agree. And ﬁnancially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in thevehicle or a lease is -- will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preservethe option value of increased value of time. But we do understand that some customers who haveownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront. And so this will enablethose customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely. As you may be like, at a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area underthe curve of customer happiness. That is our goal. And we think that that's the kind of thing that allcompanies should try to do. And it's what results in long-term value creation. And loyalty begetsloyalty.

How much revenue have yourecognized so far?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSo there's a couple of things on the ﬁnancials for Full Self-Driving. So currently, in North America,it's sold for $7,000 as an option. We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of itgoes into deferred revenue. That's associated with features that will be released with time. Ourdeferred revenue balance is continuing to grow. It's a little bit over $600 million. And so as werelease features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have beenreleased, the associated value, and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into ourﬁnancials for that quarter. And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we canrecognize that revenue. So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenuewithin period. So I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful grossmargin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorAbsolutely. There's also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the ﬂeet out there that couldupgrade to turn on Autopilot -- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving. And that's something that wewill enable just as simple in-app purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the end of theyear, as a subscription. So that's just a lot of untapped potential there. That's not in the deferredrevenue line, obviously, but is -- which is certainly a great deal of deferred potential that we think is-- a large portion of which is likely to reach fruition.",

So we started with deliveries of performance initially. And so thathelps create some of the margin.

But it's similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model 3when we launched that product in Fremont 2 years ago.On the cost side, I think you hit on a couple of the buckets. The commonality",

Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringI was just going to say, I mean, I think one of the things we focused on with the Model Y and nowModel 3 heat pump system was learning how to build a tightly integrated system capable of movingheat to and from anywhere really, powertrain, battery, cabin, the environment, in -- outside ambienttemperatures, all the way down to like negative 20 C, so 30 C. And that's deﬁnitely applicable to thehome needs of heating and cooling the home and the water in your house, so certainly applicable.Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely. I think like the heat -- for heat pump in the car, being able to use the batteries bothas a thermal and an electric energy reservoir is very signiﬁcant. Same thing could be applied to ahome with the water heater, so -- and the back of pack itself, of course. So I think there's potentialfor an integrated home system that kind of does power generation/storage, heating/cooling, airﬁltration, water puriﬁcation in a really tight package. We don't actually have like a prototype oranything, but I think conceptually, that is something that would be probably good to have.",
