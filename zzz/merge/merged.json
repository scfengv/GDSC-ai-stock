As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director of InvestorRelations. Sir, you may begin.Martin ViechaThank you, Sherri, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2018 Q&A Webcast.I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and Doug Field.Our Q1 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter we published at the samelink as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differmaterially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filingswith the SEC. Before jumping into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectI think our letter says most of it, but I think we're going to spend extra time on Q&A, try to answer asmany questions as possible. I think we should really answer -- so we're going to go as long as there aregood questions to answer.The thing I'm most excited about is the rapid increase in output. We got -- just in the last 24 hours atGigafactory managed to achieve a sustained rate of over 3,000 packs per day -- sorry, per week, andactually reached the peak hour with -- if extrapolated outward would be a rate of around 5,000 cars perweek. And obviously, you can't take a peak hour and assume every peak is -- every hour is as good asthe peak. But it's -- if you can -- if you're going to achieve it even once in an hour, then with continuedrefinement of the system and improved operational uptime of the machinery, it means that you canachieve that sustained rate with more refinement. So if we spend essentially a month or 2 improving theoperational uptime and the system as a whole, we'll be able to do well over 5,000, I think.I mean, what's interesting is that, at least in the case of pack production, we were able to do this withminimal CapEx.",

        "original_text": "And I think, in general, our understanding of production is improving dramatically --exponentially, in fact, and we are seeing ways to achieve improved volume with dramatically less CapExby simplifying the production line, by really engaging with our associates, no matter how junior, andimproving the way that parts are made. It's amazing how everybody's got good ideas. Just need tosolicit those ideas and implement them and then making ongoing design improvements so that when wediscover that something is not well designed for manufacturing, that we will very quickly change that partdesign and introduce that into the flow.One of the things we also found is that there are some things that are very well suited to manualoperation and some things that are very well suited to automated operation, and the 2 should not beconfused. So I should be clear that the vast majority of the Tesla production system is automated.However, as I mentioned in a tweet a few months ago, we did go too far in the automation front andautomated some pretty silly things. One example would be we have this -- so this is sort of ironicallyfoolish. We had these fiberglass mats on the top of the battery pack, but basically like -- they're basicallyfluff. So we tried to automate the placement and bonding of fluff to the top of the battery pack, whichis ridiculous. Like so we had fluffer bot, which was really an incredibly difficult machine to make work. 5Machines are not good at picking up pieces of fluff, okay. Human hands are way better at doing that. Andso we had a super complicated machine using a vision system to try to put a piece of fluff on the batterypack. That same -- and one of the questions asked was, \"Do we actually need that?\" So we tested a carwith and without and found that there was no change in the noise volume in the cabin, so we actually hada part that was unnecessary that was -- of course, the line kept breaking down because fluffer bot wouldfrequently just fail to pick up the fluff or put it in like a random location. So that was one of the silliestthings I found.We were also -- and this still remains to be fixed, but -- in a lot of cases, but we're overgeneralizing thedesign.",

        "original_text": "So for example, the current battery pack has a port for the front-drive units, which we then puta blanking plate, a sealed blanking plate on. So essentially, we punched a hole in it and put a blankingplate at the hole and do that for all rear-drive unit cars, which is kind of crazy. We've added cost. We'veadded a manufacturing step, better failure mode, and for something that is unnecessary. So that issomething that's -- or example of some things. That's changed. So -- and then result is we've had aradical improvement in production -- battery pack production went from taking 7 hours to make a pack 3weeks ago to under [ 70 ] minutes now, so just to show that it's like really radical improvement. It's R&Dpossible.We also saw a modest improvement in Zone 4 of module production. This, I should point out, is a clearlyautomated zone, and we're able to also achieve a sustained rate of 3,000 vehicles a week. So we'reactually slightly ahead in battery module and pack production than expected. And with some work atthe Fremont vehicle plant, primarily in the general assemble -- general assembly area, I'm confident wewill very soon exceed the 3,000 mark in Fremont. So we're already there in the body shop, which is alsoalmost entirely automated, where we weld up the body. They were already capable of over 3,000 cars aweek, and the general assembly, with some improvements, which will include reductions on -- reduction-- I should say, temporary reduction in automation in a few places, then we should be able to do 3,000.So basically I'm feeling really good about the Tesla production of Model 3, and I'm very proud of the workthat the team has done. It's been an amazing amount of hard work and sacrifice by some very talentedpeople to achieve this outcome.It's worth noting the -- you see a chart in the Model 3 market share versus competitors in midsizedpremium sedans. We are almost the best-selling sedan in the United States in this category and -- as ofApril, and we will certainly be there in May, unless something really odd -- I mean, be there in May, andthen we'll really be there later this year, right.",

Want to talk a little bit about some of the -- first of all, if we talk about the -- sort of all relate to theproduction ramp. If we talk about the 5,000 per week run rate, is that assuming 7/24 ? Or at what pointdo you think you'd get to sort of 5-day, 2-shift operation?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, first of all, I think a 5-day, 2-shift operation is a ridiculous way to operate because that wouldbe a very poor use of CapEx. Nor is it the way that we have operated in -- for most of Tesla. So themodule production -- the cell module and battery pack production and powertrain production have alwaysoperated on a 24/7 basis. And the exception has been general assembly, which has operated on typically 2to 3 shifts, so about a 5- to 6-day, 20-hour shift; and paint, which has operated on kind of a 6-day basis.So I think it just makes sense to operate the whole company on the same basis, but a majority of Teslais always operated -- a majority of Tesla production has operated around 24/7 basis since we startedproduction.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. And this is J.B. I can chime in. As Elon said, it really makes great use of the CapEx and the lines, andthat's why we did it, starting way back at the beginning of S. But aligning everything to the same shiftschedule makes it so much more efficient because we don't have the seesaw of inventory, the underlyinginventory between the different shops.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectExactly. And one of the key things to improving the capital efficiency of the system is reducing work inprogress -- work in process. And if you don't have -- if the shifts are not aligned, then you have to buildup inventory in kind of a storage warehouse and then -- yes. So it's pretty foolish to actually operateon a 5-day, 2-shift in any way. But it's -- this is sort of a -- we're using the chip fab approach to capitalefficiency, so it's called [indiscernible]. I don't know where it says what. I'm not sure what it's called. Butlike this is something called...Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerUltimate workweek.Elon R.

So to the extent that you're adding humans incertain automated processes, can you just help us interpret the extent to which these changes affect theeconomics on Model 3? And to the extent that you've done some competitive analysis, all of these effortsin the Tesla production system, how do you stack up competitively against other OEMs in terms of laborhours per vehicle or depreciation per vehicle?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, I'll just say something -- so a few things, then I have -- Deepak can elaborate. Let's see. So thething that I've noticed is, if you have a really complicated machine like the fluff bot that I was talkingabout earlier, in order to keep it operating, you have to have a ton of maintenance engineering. So youhave like basically pretty expensive maintenance engineers that have to maintain the thing and fix it, like,basically 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. The cost of the maintenance engineer may not be incorporateddirectly into -- or fully incorporated directly into gross margin, but it's nonetheless a cost that far exceedsthe labor cost of simply placing the fluff on the battery pack, which, as I said, that was unnecessary. So Ithink to actually -- I do not see this having a much of a long-term impact in our cost. I actually see it mostlikely our cost will decrease, or we consider the cost to producing the vehicles will decrease by getting ridof production stations that are really poorly suited to robotics because of the very expensive cost of robottechnicians.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerRod, we are very CapEx efficient, or let me just start from that point. And if we look at our depreciationcost on a per-unit basis at steady run rate of 5,000 or so cars per week, we are, in my mind, well belowa lot of our -- I mean, most of our competitors, well below $2,000 per unit depreciation cost.

Although it is remarkable -- although the amount of money spent in the beginning is really quite lowin the beginning of a development program, decisions made at the beginning of a development programhave massive implications for future CapEx.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThe answer is yes, and it'll come down to what other economics come into play from currencies tocommodities, and how much more cost we take out from labor.

I think you had said lastquarter that once you got to 5,000 units, you felt that you could get to 25% gross margins on Model 3, sothat feels like at least a 6- or 9-month delay relative to what you thought a quarter ago. And I'm trying tounderstand what the key drivers are. Is it really the labor for capital substitution? I don't think currencysequentially has changed much. I understand it can be a headwind. But I think relative to when you madethose statements, it hasn't changed. So perhaps you can help us understand what has changed in termsof the gross margin ramp for Model 3 relative to what you thought before. And I have a follow-up, please.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, it's along the lines of what we said in the letter. If we look at the combination of the recently imposedtariffs, Section 232 and countervailing duties plus commodity price increases as well as the weaker dollar,that is adding significant material cost. And then temporarily, we are using more labor. So when youcombine those 2, that's what led to our guidance. And certainly, the material -- the labor cost piece, wewill address and that will come out.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. But I mean, we're only talking about a 3% to 5% difference.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectSure. So I mean, that's -- thank you for an interesting question. The launch involve -- where things areobviously going towards is a shared electric autonomy model. So the -- in order for this to -- obviouslyfor the whole sort of system to work, you need all the pieces in place. You need to have full autonomy,full 4 or 5, whatever you want to call it, and obviously a lot of cars in the road and then build the softwareinfrastructure behind that to enable shared autonomy, so to help enable people to share their cars andbe able to offer their cars as effectively kind of a robo Lyft or robo Uber. It's sort of like a combination oflike, I guess, Uber, Lyft and Airbnb type of thing, where you can own your car and have a higher percentusage of an autonomous electric car. You can say it's available generally to anyone who wants to use itwhen you're not using it. You can recall it at will. You can restrict usage to only friends and family or onlyusers who are 5-star. Like this is like the obvious thing that's going to happen. But in order for that to bein place, we have to obviously sell full autonomy, and we're making a really good progress on that front.I believe that the current production of -- the vehicles that we are currently producing are capable of fullautonomy, but the only thing that would really be, like, might be needed or maybe is probably neededis a computer upgrade to have more processing power for the vision neural net.

The thing that's tricky withautonomous vehicles is that autonomy doesn't reduce the accident rate or fatality rate to 0 . It improvesit substantially. But the reality is that even though we think our -- when we think autonomy, even carautonomy reduces the probability of a death by 30%, which would be incredible because this is like, ifapplied broadly, there's over 1 million, I think, 1.2 million automotive deaths per year. And how manydo you read about? Basically none of them. However -- and but if it's an autonomous situation, you --it's headline news. And the media fails to mention that, actually, they shouldn't really be writing thestory. They should be writing a story about how autonomous cars are really safe, but that's not the storyif you want a click on, so they write inflammatory headlines that are fundamentally misleading to thereaders. It's really outrageous. So -- and this would be true like even if electric cars were -- I'm sorry, ifautonomous cars were 10x safer. So instead of 1 million deaths, you have 100,000 deaths, there's stillgoing to be people who will still sue and say, \"Hey, you're responsible for the death here.\" And it's like,well, the 90% of people who didn't die are not suing. They're not -- they're still alive. You just don't knowit, so you -- we've got to deal with that. And then obviously regulators respond to public pressure andthe press. So if the press is hounding the regulators, and the public is laboring on misapprehension thatautonomy is less safe because of that -- of misleading press, then this is where I find the things to -- thechallenge of predicting it to be very difficult. And yes, it's really incredibly irresponsible of any journalistwith integrity to write an article that would lead people to believe that Tesla -- that autonomy is less safebecause people might actually turn it off and then die.

And you need only a small crew to operate the train.However, trains don't go everywhere. So you have to like have a truck to deliver things to the train railspur and then pick stuff -- pick it up. And then at the destination, the truck's got to pick it up from the railspur over there. So you still have trucks plus train plus transfer. So I think platooning of trucks will quitedramatically affect the rail industry in a negative way.Galileo RussellOkay. Last one, I promise. On Tesla Energy, I assume that you guys are basically supply constrained, notdemand constrained on that side of the business. So I'm wondering how you're prioritizing residentialversus utility scale. And in particular, how has this successful project in South Australia sort of changed theindustry's perception of what batteries can do?Elon R.",

The -- there's -- South Australia took a chance on doingthe world's biggest battery. That's worked out really well. If you read the articles, it's worked out farbeyond their expectations because the battery's able to respond at the millisecond level, far faster thanany hydrocarbon plant. And so it's value and good stabilization is much greater actually than even a gasturbine plant, which can normally respond quite fast. So it's kind of like you get in a Tesla and you can --you have that instant acceleration. Feels like you like have -- also like a mind meld with the car. It's justlike the car is you. And then that same rapid response is true of the battery pack. So the customers that --the utilities that worked with us thus far have really loved the battery pack. And I feel confident that we'llbe able to announce a deal at the gigawatt-hour scale within a matter of months. So it's a 1,000 gigawatts-- megawatt-hours -- 1,000 megawatt-hours for [ zeroing gigawatt-hours ].Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, maybe just for the first part of your question also, it is absolutely accurate that we are still -- there'smore than enough demand. And we are still building under our demand backlog and actually increasing itslightly. And we're trying to do our best to prioritize customers between residential Powerwall and utilityand commercial. I'd say our longer-term strategy is to shift a little bit of our focus and really catch up onour Powerwall demand backlog, which is quite -- it's too long right now. We know people are waiting toolong. So that's -- I think that's generally the direction we're trying to take that. But Model 3 has taken alot of focus in the last few quarters, and that trend is going to be reversing in the second half of the year.Martin ViechaLet's go to the next question, please.",

Can you give us any color from what you'reseeing in your data as it relates to the confidence that your consumers have in the Autopilot functionality,whether they've used it more or less frequently in their existing vehicles or whether they've opted topurchase the functionality more or less in lieu of these accidents?

Mr. Viecha, you may begin.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2018 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and a number of otherexecutives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter wepublished at the same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectThanks, Martin. Last year was definitely the most challenging year in Tesla history, but also themost successful. Thanks to the incredible work of the Tesla team, Model 3 became the best-sellingpremium vehicle in the U.S. for 2018. And in fact, when considering battery electric vehicles, Teslaachieved an 80% market share of U.S. sales in the last year. I think this point is perhaps not wellappreciated. All other electric vehicles combined were 20% of sales in the U.S. in last year. So Ithink that's not bad.We also delivered -- also made vehicles last year as we did in all prior years combined, which is atremendous achievement by the Tesla team. The -- if you track Tesla vehicle production year-over-year, cumulative sales deliveries year-over-year, it is about the cleanest exponential I've ever seen.We've basically almost doubled our fleet every year. Every year, we make as many cars as we did inall prior years. So this is a very unusual thing to see for -- especially for a large complexmanufactured object. I think it may be the fastest that a complex manufactured object like a car hasgrown in history, or at least I'm not aware of anything that is faster. Martin, are you -- do you...?Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRI'm not sure.",

So with the deliveries this year being -- even inthe face of -- if there's a global recession -- even if there's a global recession, we're expectingdeliveries this year to be about 50% higher than last year. And this -- it could be a lot more thanthat. But even with tough economic times, to receive 50% growth is pretty nutty.Over Q4, we achieved GAAP profitability for the second quarter for the first time in the companyhistory, and we increased our cash on hand by more than $700 million, even after paying debt,ending the year with a total of $3.7 billion of cash. This means we have enough cash to settle ourconvertible bond that will mature in March.In addition, our operating margin remains strong at 5.7%. Operating margins in the fourth quarterare usually lower in the automotive industry, but this was not the case for Tesla.2019 is going to be an amazing year for Tesla. As I mentioned, we're expecting to increase sales by50%. Perhaps it could be a lot more than 50%, but I think 50% is a very reasonable number. Butthat's crazy growth for the automotive industry.I want to note that one of our major priorities this quarter is improving service operations. So really,from my standpoint, when I think about what my priorities are this quarter, it's improving service inNorth America. That's #1. And I think there are some very exciting initiatives we're going to rollout with regard to that. We're going to get cars to China and Europe and make sure that we havegood logistics for the whole delivery process, from factory gate to the customer. That's obviouslypretty far from California to get to Europe and China and then get to -- get product to ourcustomers. So we're working every aspect of that logistics chain. And I think we've -- I think it'sgoing to be good.I'd say at this point, I'm optimistic about being profitable in Q1. Not by a lot, but I'm optimisticabout being profitable in Q1 and for all quarters going forward.So let's see, we've opened 27 new store and service locations, bringing our total locationsworldwide to 378.

So the car has already notified Tesla emergency services, and a service loaner, atow truck, are on their way before your car has even come to a stop.

We just have to -- it's like automatically going to happen,you just press cancel.We're also improving product distribution. So I think we made a strategic error in the past about nothaving service parts located at our service centers.

So unless you have an unusual color, we can literally replace yourfascia in 15, 20 minutes, and there's none of this, like, weeks at a body shop stuff.Let's see, in terms of the new products, with Model Y , we've completed [ensuring] of and design ofModel Y , and the products are -- the tooling that's going out for production of Model Y , 3/4 of theModel Y is common with the Model 3, so it's a much lower CapEx per vehicle than Model 3.

And we're most likely goingto put Model Y production right next to -- in fact, as part of our main Gigafactory in Nevada.

So we're going to take the first questions from our retail investors who have beensubmitting their questions on say.com. So the question that has been submitted has been aboutservice, which I think you already spoke at length about. So let's go to the second question.The second question would be, how are you feeling about demand right now across the productline? Is 500,000 to 700,000 units at $42,000 ASP still a realistic annual target for Model 3, evenconsidering Model Y and its impact on demand? And do you continue to see S and X demand of100,000 annually?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI mean, my best guess, this is just a guess, my best guess for demand of Model 3 worldwide issomething -- in a strong economy, is something on the order of 700,000 or 800,000 units a year.That's my best guess for demand of Model 3 in a strong economy. If the economy goes into arecession, then I think that could be something on the -- 40% less. But I think even in a recession,worldwide demand is still something in the order of 500,000 for Model 3. For S and X, we dideliminate the 75 kilowatt hour version of S and X and to provide more differentiation relative to 3and then Y that's coming out. I think we could see a slight decline in total vehicles, but I think thenet cash flow from S and X is likely to be very similar. So probably no major change in net cashflow for S and X.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The next question from Alex is, can you please share an update on full self-driving and TeslaNetwork development? When will customers start to see full self driving features? What's the bestcase time line for Tesla Network to go live?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectSure. We -- we already have full self-driving capability on highway. So from highway on-ramp tohighway exit, including passing cars and going from one highway interchange to another, full selfdriving capability is there. In a few weeks, we'll be pushing an update that will allow the option ofremoving stalk confirm in markets where regulators approve it, which we believe that will be thecase in the U.S., for example.",

So it's really quite profound to have that experience. Then the next part of fullself-driving would really be to -- is traffic lights. So it's hard. So stop streets are pretty easy becauseyou can essentially geocode those and it's easier to recognize stop signs. Traffic lights andintersections will be the next really tricky one.

Is there any guidance you can provide us in terms of how tothink about CapEx for this facility going forward? And can you discuss the source of funds for theproject? I think you've spoken in the past about the potential to raise debt locally in China. Is thatstill your thinking? And what kind of terms might you be able to raise that capital?Deepak Ahuja - Tesla, Inc. - Former CFOYes, Deepak here. You're right. The purchase of the land is a 50-year lease with the government ofChina. So it's not CapEx, but it's operating lease that shows up as cash flow from operations.However, the CapEx that we will invest is our equipment, and we fully own it. So that will show upas capital expenditures. The plan, as we have indicated in the letter, is still to get funding for amajority of debt capital spending from local China banks.

And the theme of our conversations here is, how do we reduce cost all the time? And howdo we run our business with a very high level of financial discipline? And Elon alluded to that andso did Jerome, I think. That if we do that, we believe that even in some of the scenarios of lowervolumes and pricing, tight pricing, we do have a good chance and a good shot of being profitableand generate free cash flow. So that's the best way to manage the business, be frugal.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes, I don't want to be a broken record about this, it's costs, costs, costs, cost, because reducing ourcosts -- by the way, while making modest improvements to Model 3, I want to emphasize, theproduct is getting better by slight degrees despite lower cost, in hundreds of small ways, that youactually wouldn't -- most people wouldn't notice explicitly, but they would appreciatesubconsciously. And getting those costs down, variable costs and fixed costs, is what allows us tolower the price and be financially sustainable and achieve our mission of environmentalsustainability.

As a reminder, this conference may berecorded.I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Senior Director of Investor Relations, MartinViecha. Sir, you may begin.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Latif, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2019 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of otherexecutives.Our Q3 results were announced at about 1:45 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter we published atthe same link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So last quarter, we delivered more than 95,000 vehicles, which is a record for Tesla. Putthat in perspective, it's nearly an 80% increase in deliveries compared to the second quarter of lastyear. I think it's sometimes hard for people to appreciate when you have a large manufactured itemwith a complex global supply chain just how difficult that is. I'm incredibly proud of the Tesla teamfor being able to do that.I think this level of growth is possibly unprecedented. It might be the fastest that any large complexmanufactured item has grown in history. So just, I think, really great work by the Tesla team toachieve that outcome, and we expect growth to continue in the future at -- for several years to comeat the 50% to 100% level. So as I said, I think that is not well appreciated how the quotas grow atthat rate.But achieving record number of deliveries is an important milestone and shows the rapid progresswe've made in managing a global logistics and delivery operation at high volume. And as I said, allof this was achieved thanks to the tremendous hard work of the entire Tesla team.Model 3 is once again the best-selling premium vehicle in the U.S., outselling all of its gas-powered equivalents combined.",

        "original_text": "In Europe, Model 3 is approaching sales levels of its established premiumcompetitors, and it was awarded a 5-star rating from Euro NCAP earlier this month. This is inaddition to Model 3 receiving an overall 5-star rating in the U.S. from NHTSA and -- includingearning 5 stars in every category and subcategory and achieving the lowest probability of injury ofany vehicle ever tested.Motor Trend also recently selected Model S as the best vehicle they have ever tested in their 70-year history across all other cars. So Motor Trend, which is arguably the leading authority inevaluating vehicles, the Motor Trend Car of the Year is the most coveted award. It's prettyincredible that they would say that Model S in their entire 70-year history is the best vehicle theyhave ever evaluated. This is despite Tesla not buying any advertising in Motor Trend, and it speaksto their journalistic integrity. That's something special.So -- and since the vehicle that they evaluated, we've actually made -- committed to advancementsof both Model S and Model X, including our recent update of a new suspension with activedamping capability and an all-new drivetrain that's capable of a 370-mile range in the Model S anda 325-mile range in the Model X. We've also issued numerous software updates and improvementsthat have made Model S and Model X faster, safer and added dozens of new features. Just likeModel 3, Model S and X have the hardware needed for future full self-driving capability.As we look ahead to the rest of the year and into 2020, we remain focused on launching newvehicle and energy programs, further expanding on manufacturing operations and continuing toimprove customer service. We remain focused on international expansion because local productionis essential to being cost-competitive. By the end of this year, we will -- we expect to be producingModel 3s in volume out of Gigafactory Shanghai. And as you can see from the photos in ourquarterly letter, the equipment installation there is progressing well. We also have to finalize alocation for our European Gigafactory before the end of the year.Here in Fremont, preparations for Model Y production have already begun. Since Model Y has highcomponent overlap with Model 3, it should be -- we expect it to be a lot easier to ramp. It'ssomething in the order of 3/4 of all the parts are common between Model 3 and Model Y .",

        "original_text": "And weexpect many manufacturing costs for Model Y , despite additional content, to be approximately thesame as Model 3.This quarter, we opened 25 new service locations and added more than 100 Mobile Service vehiclesto our fleet. And although our fleets have a total -- Tesla fleet size has doubled in the past 12months, which is again just kind of a crazy thing to consider that Tesla is almost doubling allcumulative production every year. This is a totally mad thing to make as many cars in a year aswe've made in our entire history and to have that be an ongoing trend, I think it's difficult for peopleto really feel an exponential. We didn't evolve to feel an exponential. We can feel a linear, but wecan only understand an exponential at a cognitive level.But Tesla is expanding at an exponential rate. And in fact, if you look at the Tesla cumulativedeliveries chart like year-over-year cumulative deliveries, it's about the cleanest exponential graphI've ever seen. So obviously, if that trend continues, the results, I think, are going to be prettyamazing. And I think that will continue.So we've been able to improve service considerably. You can imagine that if -- obviously, if we'redoubling our fleet every year, managing service is quite difficult. It's like a total -- because servicescales as not just with new production but as the total fleet scales, service needs to scale. And wewant to scale service in a way that's sensible from a cost standpoint. But it's really quite a difficultchallenge to scale.Nonetheless, we've made massive improvements in service, especially in parts waiting -- time towait for parts and collision repair. And we've in-sourced a great deal of the collision repairactivities, which has had, I think, quite a good effect on customer happiness. And this will continuein the months to come.So it's a very important milestone. I think we believe Tesla has -- is now at the point of being self-funding, and we expect to be cash flow -- free cash flow positive in future quarters with the possibletemporary exceptions around the launch and ramp of new product. From a profitability standpoint,we expect to be probably around breakeven this quarter and profitable next quarter. So that's -- I feelpretty confident about that.And then in terms of deliveries, we expect deliveries to be between 360,000 and 400,000.",

So people often confuse deliveries, production and orders for Tesla, and they'reactually 3 different numbers. So yes, you obviously cannot deliver more than you make, and sotypically, we will make more than we deliver. And then demand generation activities kind of movein kind of like -- to get together with production like it doesn't make sense to put a lot of effort intodemand generation if production can't meet the demand.And likewise -- so what tends to happen is that we'll solve the production issues, then say, okay, weneed to increase demand -- address demand then we may increase production, then increasedemand. And like I truly get caught up in these details a lot, but if you look at the actual results, likeI said, look at cumulative deliveries over time for Tesla, cleanest exponential we've ever seen,extrapolate that curve.So there's a tremendous amount to be excited about at Tesla, and we'll have more share in thecoming weeks and months. Zach, is there anything you'd like to say about our results?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, sure. And thanks, Elon. A few things I want to highlight before moving into the Q&A. Overall,Q2 was a strong quarter for Tesla. I'm extremely proud of the team for the progress we've made.We've achieved record vehicle production and delivery, record storage production and deployment,record services and other revenue with a corresponding reduced loss. As we've mentioned a fewtimes, we stabilized international logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes. And we sawgross margin improvement in nearly every aspect of the business, adjusting for the impact ofregulatory credit revenue.As a result of these accomplishments, we once again achieved strong free cash flows, which is onlypartially attributed to working capital benefits. We also successfully raised roughly $2.4 billion innet proceeds in May. Thus, we exited the quarter with $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, thehighest in our history. Our net loss reduced significantly relative to Q1, aided by higher volumes inprogress on cost efficiencies.A few things to note. There's $117 million within operating expenses for restructuring. We had asequential reduction of $104 million related to regulatory credit, which is inherently lumpy. And inour other income line, we saw a $66 million reduction.",

Adjusting for the impact of credits,automotive gross margin improved materially. For Model S and Model X, ASPs are impacted bypricing actions applied to inventory of vehicles built prior to the launch of our powertrain andsuspension upgrades in April, the majority of which were sold and delivered in Q2.For Model 3, global ASPs stabilized during the quarter at roughly $50,000, a sequential reduction,yet gross profit per Model 3 improved, representing the continued success of our cost managementefforts. Note that we continue to defer a significant portion of revenue associated with full self-driving, which will be recognized in future periods upon the release of additional features.Operating expenses, net of restructuring, continues to improve as well despite the increases involume, reflecting the immense focus on improving our operating efficiency. And while operatingexpenses and capital expenses may appear to be unnaturally low this quarter, that's not the case.Rather, these reflect continued progress on cost efficiency and ability to scale our core technologiesand processes.If we take a step back here, I think it's important to remember that Tesla is on a long-term journey,and it's difficult to see the full picture looking quarter-to-quarter. We committed that Model 3 willbe a transformative product, both for the industry and our business. 3 years ago, we unveiled theModel 3. 2 years ago, we brought the product to market. 1 year ago, we demonstrated our ability tobuild the Model 3 at high rate.So far this year, we've demonstrated our ability to manage global deliveries and logistics at a higherrate, but the most important thing is that we've demonstrated our ability to generate significantorganic demand as nearly all orders generated in Q2 were nonreservation holders. And thus far inQ3, our order pacing is ahead of where we were at this point in Q2. And as we noted in our Q2production and delivery release, our order backlog increased over the course of Q2.Ultimately, the Model 3 is accomplishing what our business needs it to do.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorSure. There's a number of things to consider here. The -- there's really 2 key dimensions fordemand. There's value for money, and then there's affordability. Obviously, if somebody simplydoes not have enough money to buy the car, it doesn't matter how much the -- how good the valuefor money is. You can have infinite value for money, but if someone does not have the funds to buythe car, they simply can't get it. So it's very important to parse those 2, and I think there's like --there's tremendous amount of desire to buy our cars, but people -- obviously, if they don't haveenough money to buy them, they cannot. So we have to make the cars more affordable.And effectively back in the U.S., our cars got almost $2,000 more expensive with the expiry of thetax credit on July 1 -- or the partial expiry.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOGenerally on ASP, as we noted in the letter, it was roughly, even over the course of the quarter,stabilized around $50,000. And we have good visibility into where our ASPs are going based onorder data. And so that gives us 1 to 2 months of lead as to where our actual recognized ASPs willbe. And so I would expect some adjustment to our Model 3 ASPs as a result of this pricing change,but the trim mix will offset some of that. And we continue to make great progress on costefficiencies. And so overall in net, our expectation is that the Model 3 gross margin will continue togrow.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. On the gross margin point, like the full self-driving is just an extremely important part of themargin calculation, and the features for full self-driving are -- only a portion of them have rolledout. So the revenue recognition on the full self-driving option is limited at first until those featuresroll out. And also, the demand for the full self-driving package is limited because the features aremostly prospective instead of current. But as those features roll out, I would expect the take rate forfull self-driving to increase significantly as well as the recognition -- revenue recognition of fullself-driving to obviously match the rollout of the product. So the gross margin over time will bereally quite compelling when factoring in the full self-driving option, which is, yes, accounted to$7,000 in mid-August. And that number will increase over time.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThe second question is many of us who follow Tesla closely are incredibly excited about Batteryand Powertrain Investor Day and its technology implications.

Mobile Service is really great because it's like we just come to youand fix the car wherever you are. And it's hard to beat that for convenience.

As you pointed out, the best service is no service. So we're trying to continue improving thequality of the cars. And we track this daily, and fewer and fewer service visits are required from themost recent cars that we're building. So we're on a good trend there. We also need a lot fewer workto finish the cars in the factory. Besides that, we stock way many more parts in all the servicecenters, and we ship everything same day pretty much so that people don't have to wait for cars --for parts.

If they sell more EVs, then there's not really a need to do a deal with Tesla, and if they sell fewer,then there is. And the --I Think the Z EV Credit Situation, I Think really needs Reform.

How much is coming from externally?And what's your expectation around cost per watt hours as you start to ramp?Elon R.

I mean I think we probably need to like just do like a reset like -- I'm not saying master planpart 3, but it's really like, to some degree, the Battery Day will be kind of like master plan part 3,which is like, okay, how we get from kind of in the tens of gigawatt hours per year to multipleterawatt hours per year. That's a pretty giant-scale increase. And so yes, it's an increase of sort ofroughly 100. Like if we're at 28 gigawatt hours right now -- well, actually, there is more than thatwhen you count the factories in Japan.

Obviously,you guys have some ideas around how big that market is. How should we be thinking aboutsustainable volumes and pricing on those volumes? Obviously, we're seeing some lower numbershere, and I think that's a core element of what's going on with the story that as we see pricing dropand volumes drop, what are the right numbers to think about for you guys from a planningstandpoint in terms of sell-through on both the Model S and Model X?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think it's probably a bit too much focus on S and X. And the S and X are -- they are nice, butthey're not -- and I think it's like without them, we couldn't spell sexy. So like the main reason --well, not the main reason, but a reason is we want to keep spelling sexy. So that's -- not that I like --that is a reason, I should say, not the main reason to keep going with S and X.But the story for Tesla future is fundamentally Model 3 and Model Y . And I think -- so like myguess is like long-term sales of -- long-term meaning couple years type thing, the demand for --sales demand for 3 is like on order of 0.75 million units a year, and it's probably 1.25 million units ayear for Model Y .

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureI'd like to ask you, Elon, about distribution. So you made like -- you guys made a big change at thebeginning of the year, going from like an almost 100% online distribution model. You tried to pushback on test drive and get people to buy the car, try it and return it if they don't like it. So could yougive us an update on how it is progressing? Do you see this start becoming mostly like an onlinedistribution -- following an online distribution model? And I saw you opened 25 new retaillocations in the quarter. So how do you see your retail footprint evolving over time?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorAs I said, we opened 25 service locations. I think really what we find is that the word of mouth forTesla is incredibly good. So once there's an increase of customers in a particular area, they love thecars and they talk to all their friends about it. And that's really what drives sales. So if you think oflike a retail location is kind of like a viral seed in an area. It would grow organically by itself, butthe retail location is actually is like a viral seed. It's not that -- they aren't needed. They're like anaccelerant.But what is needed for sales in any given area, and I'd say this worldwide, frequently we've beentold like this country is different or that country is different. I'm like people around the world prettymuch want the same thing so -- in my experience. But they have to have a service location that'sconvenient. So it can't be like you've got to drive 5 hours to a service location. You have to haveservice. You have to have supercharging and charging all sorted out. You've got to have goodconsumer financing. And then the price must make sense. And any place where those 4 things aretrue, our sales are great. So we're rolling out service centers like crazy.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. We expect to be able to offer full self-driving actually everywhere except EU because there'sjust some committee rules that were put in place years ago that need to be changed. It's up -- from atechnical standpoint, it's very doable, but we just need to work through the regulatory committees toget the regulatory approvals and rules changed. It's just -- it all just takes a bit longer than in otherplaces. But I think we'll see a lot of pressure from our customers in Europe to have these ruleschanged so they can have access to full self-driving. And I think at the end of the day, the regulatorswill answer to the public. So I think it's just a temporary thing, and it's quite specific to EU rules.And we're just not present really when those rules were drafted.

They've done an incredible job, and it's an honor to workwith such a great team. I mean there were so many challenges, too numerous to name, but they gotit done. And just what a great group to work with, like I said, it's just an honor to work with such agreat team.So -- and as a result, we were able to achieve our fourth consecutive profitable quarter. Andalthough the automotive industry was down about 30% year-over-year in the first half of the year,we managed to grow deliveries in the first half of the year. So despite that massive industry decline,we actually went up.We're also very excited to announce that we're going to be building our next Gigafactory in Texas.It's going to be right near Austin. It will be about -- I'll just go into a bit of detail on this, and thenI'm sure there'll be a lot of questions. But the location is 5 minutes from Austin InternationalAirport and 15 minutes from Downtown Austin, and it's about 2,000 acres, and we're going to makeit a factory that is going to be stunning.

So it's alreadyunderway, started this weekend. Let's see, moving on to other subjects.Solar. We recently adjusted the pricing of our retrofit solar. So Tesla Solar is the lowest cost solar inthe United States. And we added the lowest cost guarantee and a money-back guarantee. So we'revery confident that people will have our solar product, whether it's the solar retrofit or Solar Roof.Our solar is now 30% cheaper than the U.S. average. After the federal tax credit, Tesla Solar nowcosts $1.49 per watt. And it's a very simple, highly automated single-click experience.

So the current Tesla Model S now has an EPA-certified range of 402 miles. I mean youbasically can drive from L.A. to San Francisco nonstop and still have some miles left over whenyou arrive. And this is at highway speed. So you don't have to do anything, drive slowly oranything, drive -- you can just drive normally and go very long distances.And then for Full Self-Driving, we launched traffic lights and stop signs, and we continue toimprove that to make them more robust. And we're currently testing Full Self-Driving software forintersections and city streets and narrow streets. So I personally tested the latest alpha build of theFull Self-Driving software when I drive my car. And it is really, I think, profoundly better thanpeople realize. Yes, really profoundly better. It's like amazing. So it's almost getting to a pointwhere I can go from my house to work with no interventions, despite going through constructionand widely varying situations.

This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operationsof our U.S. factories and field operations around the world. To ensure the business remains healthy,we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to personnel and noncriticalpatent projects. The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown waslargely offset by these cost savings actions, although the costs were concentrated in COGS, and thecost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses.On automotive gross margin, excluding regulatory credits, this reduced sequentially from 20% to18.7%. This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operationalefficiency due to the various shutdowns. Despite these charges, we continue to make progressreducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont and Model 3 in Shanghai. Given the globalmacroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass through savings to customers aroundthe world on some of our products.With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $48 million ofdeferred revenue in the period. The full profit impact on our P&L is less than half of this due tocosts associated with FSD computer retrofits in the field.Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $428 million. While difficult to forecastprecisely, our best estimate of 2020 credit revenue is roughly double that of 2019.Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement.In the energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit.",

This is driven almost entirely by an expense related tothe next tranche of the CEO grant as well as early vesting of the first tranche, which is reflected inSG&A within operating expenses.On cash flows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of $8.6 billion, which includedfree cash flows of over $400 million. This is a strong result on its own despite an increase in capitalexpenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin as well as movements in working capital.A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables. While our AR balance isusually about 20% of revenue, it can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors. First, overall,less than 30% of our receivables is associated with new car sales. Second, due to payment termsassociated with financing and enterprise customers, settlement time lines for certain methods ofcash payments and geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated receivablesare impacted significantly by how many cars are delivered in the final weeks and days of thequarter. Third, roughly 40% of the balance is attributed to payment terms on regulatory credit salesand statutory EV incentive programs, both of which have been increasing. Customer depositsreduced slightly as well. Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the averagedeposit per order will continue to reduce, driving down this balance.As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture.We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and closeworking capital management. This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scalingour operations and preparing for the launch of 3 new factories over the next 1.5 years.",
        "summary": "Stock-based comp increased from Q1 to Q2. This is driven almost entirely by an expense related tothe next tranche of the CEO grant as well as early vesting of the first tranche. We remainproduction-constrained in this business and are continuing to work towards building additionalcapacity. And our solar installation business was impacted by permit office closures limitinginstallation volume. On cash flows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of $8.6 billion, which includedfree cash flows of over $400 million. This was a strong result on its own despite an increase in capitalexpenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin. A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables."

        "original_text": "Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much.Let's go to questions from institutional investors first. The question #1 is, as Tesla continues itsjourney towards the long-term goal of selling 20 million units per year, what are the most importantvehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next 3 to 5 years beyond Model 3, Y andthe Cybertruck: cheaper, smaller versions of 3 and Y or region-specific vehicles or anything else?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I don't think we can comment on our detailed product road map beyond what's announcedbecause I think we want to reserve that for product launches. But it would be reasonable to assumethat we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher capacity vehicle ofsome kind. These are likely things at some point. But I do think there's a long way to go with 3 andY and with Cybertruck and Semi. So it's a long way to go with those. I think we'll do the obviousthings.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The second question from institutional is, what is your vision for software at Tesla? Whatopportunities do you see from monetizing the installed base other than via FSD?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorRight now, by far, FSD is just overwhelmingly the most important thing. I think the upgrading ofthe fleet to Full-Self Driving, especially with an over-the-air software update, I mean, may go downas the biggest asset value increase in history as a step change. Maybe there's something bigger, butit certainly would be one of the biggest -- I can't think of anything bigger. So overnight, 1 million --depending exactly on when it happens and when it's allowed in various regulatory jurisdictions,you'd have like, I don't know, at least a few million cars suddenly becoming 5x more valuable orsomething like that, something like 5x higher utility. They go from like 12 hours a week of utility,something like that, that's hours of use, to 60, something like that. So everything else is pretty smallby comparison.Now when things do become Full-Self Driving, so what are people going to do in the car? Well, Iguess they're probably going to want to do productivity and entertainment of some kind. Watchmovies, play games and do work. That's in the future. Yes.",

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, the actual major milestone that's happening right now is really a transition of the autonomysystem of the cars like AI, if you will, from thinking about things in, I call it like, 2.5D. It's like --think of taking like isolated pictures and doing image recognition on pictures that are harshlycorrelated in time but not very well and transitioning to kind of a 4D where it's like -- which isvideo essentially. You're thinking about the world in 3 dimensions, and the fourth dimension beingtime. So that architectural change, which has been underway for some time but has not really beenrolled out to anyone in the production fleet is what really matters for Full Self-Driving.So what we've been doing thus far has really just been with like 2D -- mostly 2D. And like I said,not well correlated in time. So it's just hard to convey just how much better a fully 4D system wouldwork -- does work.",

I think part of the Alien Dreadnought concept is not justautomation but minimizing the number of process steps and complexity involved in themanufacturing system, which involves really integrating design and manufacturing across from likewhen the raw materials enter the factory to the finished goods exit. And we're learning so muchthrough doing that.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Vertical integration is extremely important for this. But the supply chain -- if you put like aGPS tracker on a molecule from when it got mined to when it was in a usable product, it wouldlook insane. It would be like, wow, it went around the world like 6 times. So with verticalintegration, maybe you can only go around the world once.

And now we can shift to retail investor questions on say.com. The first one is, Tesla Energyseems widely ignored by Wall Street despite Elon comments about growth rate exceedingautomotive. Could Tesla share more detail on calendar planned projects to help investors betterunderstand the business outlook? How disruptive is Tesla's Autobidder technology?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I can't emphasize enough, I think long term, Tesla Energy will be of roughly the same size asTesla Automotive. So I mean the energy business collectively is bigger than the automotivebusiness. So it's like how big is the energy sector? Bigger than automotive. So -- and in order toachieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think isgoing to be primarily solar and followed by wind. And those are intermittent. So you need to have alot of batteries to store the energy because the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't alwaysshine.So there's like 3 elements of the sustainable energy future: wind and solar sustainable energygeneration; battery storage; and electric transport. Those 3 things. And the mission of Tesla is toaccelerate sustainable energy.So I can't emphasize enough. The -- like yes, the battery and solar will both be enormous. And theykind of have to be in order for us to have a sustainable future. And we've got a great product roadmap on that front as well. So we're going to ship in the Megapack. It's very well received.

And just there's like 2 general classes of cell. There's like the iron phosphate and then thenickel-based. Nickel-based cells have higher energy density, so longer range.

Like are you dealing with -- are you forced to assess people statistically looking in therear-view mirror? Or can you assess people individually, looking ahead with smart projections, andinform the driver that -- of how they may reduce their -- what actions they can take to reduce theirinsurance. As Zach was alluding to, it's like, okay, you're driving too fast, you're doing this or thator the other thing, it's like if you want to pay more for insurance, you can. But if you want to payless, then please don't drive so crazy. Then people can make a choice. Like, okay, they want to driveaggressively, in that case, it'll be higher insurance, or if they want -- they're more careful in theirdriving, they pay less.This was actually very helpful for us to have a feedback loop to see what is driving insuranceexpense.",

Just on thequarter, if you could give us an update on gross margin. Was China accretive to gross margin in thesecond quarter? And give us an idea of how far off Model Y gross margin was versus FremontModel 3?And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in-sourcing is varying byregion. You're in-sourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you're relying a lot more on the supply chainin Shanghai. What do you expect your approach to be on insourcing when you eventually open upBerlin and what your Texas factory is going to be?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Just to start with the gross margin questions. We did see progress on gross margins in China,and that was despite pricing action that was taken. The factory is still not running at full capacityyet as it continues to ramp. So we think there's a continued opportunity to optimize the coststructure there.Model Y , as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production. And despitethe inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see a pretty substantial improvement inthe Model Y margin. And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structurewill converge. They're not quite there. Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, andit's not yet at full production. And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kindof back into the math there on the relative gross margins.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory. But -- and it's continuing to do more andmore internally. But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton ofparts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from everypart of the world. And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to thecost of the vehicle. And I mean the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like 5%to 10% a month.",

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystYou mentioned in the slide deck a couple of times that you were pleased with gross margin, withPTI margin progress and you expect it to achieve industry-leading operating margins over time.Maybe you could shed a little light on that. Industry-leading for luxury vendors is 8% to 10% PTI.For Porsche, smaller, at 17%. For mass market vendors, it's 5% to 8%. What do we think about?And how much, ultimately, do you believe that EV credits will contribute to that margin? Because Iknow your margin has been 5% over the last 12 months, but it's actually less than 1% excluding EVcredits. So it's a 4-point contribution right now. How do we think about ultimately what industry-leading margins are? And how much of that you think is coming from EV credits, regulatorycredits? And I have a follow-up, please.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. I've mentioned this before in terms of regulatory credit. We manage the business -- or saiddifferently, we don't manage the business with the assumption that regulatory credits will contributein a significant way to the future. I do expect regulatory credit revenue to double in 2020 relative to2019, and it will continue for some period of time. But eventually, the stream of regulatory creditswill reduce.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean it's worth noting that we're -- buyers of our car in the U.S. received 0 federal tax credit.Whereas many of our competitors are like, they get a $7,500 fed tax credit. And yet our sales havecontinued to do well. Yes.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce, manufacture and distributeour cars. That cost curve even for mature products like the S and the X continues to come down, aswe work on that, Model 3, which is our second most mature product, that continues to come down.You then layer on top of that, as Elon was discussing earlier, the potential for software-basedrevenue, particularly Full Self-Driving.

So how do you think about that trade-off betweendriving towards industry-leading profitability, yet trying to make your cars more affordable andbroader? It feels like, historically, you've always picked the path of, I'd rather drive more growthand more adoption because ultimately, that's the mission of the company. And we even saw it a littlebit this quarter with price reductions. You could have probably kept price where it is, sold someunits and had better profits, but that's been an ongoing choice that Tesla, as a company, has made.So how do you personally think about that trade-off between -- even if you were to get to industry-leading margins, wouldn't you be inclined to give more of that back to drive greater adoption morequickly?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I think we actually achieved both when you factor in autonomy. I think we can go waybeyond industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people and potentiallyalmost everyone when you're factoring in autonomy. That was really a mega game changer, gigagame changer. Yes. But I mean it is important for people to distinguish between 2 things.

Definitely not. We do have some production supply chain challengeswe're trying to solve right now.

All Tesla cars being built today have all the hardware necessary for fullself-driving, and over the year updates will enable our customers to use the Tesla ride-hailingnetwork fleet and generate income which, as we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago, we think issomewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 a year, in some cases, perhaps more. We're the onlycompany in the world producing our own vehicles and batteries as well as our own in-house chipfor full self-driving. We're in a position unlike anyone else in the industry.

So I'llsay it again, equipment fleet delivered the half of all vehicles produced -- delivered all half -- alldeliveries occurred literally in the final 10 days of Q1. As a result, a large number of vehicles -- the vehicle deliveries shifted into Q2 which, of course, Q1net income to be negatively impacted.

There were literally, to the best of my knowledge, 0predictions that this would happen, if you go back just even 5 or 6 years ago, that an electric carwould be the best-selling premium car in the U.S. And we believe, over time, we'll be the best-selling premium car throughout the world.And in fact, in Norway, in March, we set a record for the highest sales of any car period ever. Andthat'd be something similar in Switzerland as well. So these were really incredible achievements bythe Tesla team.Since the introduction of Standard Range and Standard Range Plus, nearly 70% of trade-ins fromModel 3 have actually been nonpremium vehicles, where people actually pay more for a car thanthey have ever paid for a car.",

And we also introduced the loyaltyprogram where if somebody has -- is an existing Tesla owner and they buy a performance Model Sor X, they get the Ludicrous upgrade for free. So this is -- yes, as a thank you and an appreciation toexisting Tesla customers.So they have a longer range. The Model S now has a range of 370 miles. This is actually EPA rangeof 370 miles, and Motor Trend test drove the car a few days ago and drove nonstop all the way fromSan Francisco to Los Angeles at normal highway speeds. And they said they could have even gonefaster. And there weren't any headwind as well. So this is pretty remarkable that an electric carcould go nonstop between the 2 biggest cities in California. I mean, I remember back when I wasdriving gasoline cars, I always had to stop at a gas station. This is literally better than a gasoline carwith the rare exception. And there's also an increase in power. It accelerates faster. Just better, betterin every way. And we're able to this without increasing the size of the battery pack, which is atestament to the powertrain team for it to be able to improve the efficiency of the powertrain bysuch a significant margin.So with the recently announced product improvements on Model S and X as well as continuedexpansion of Model 3 globally, we expect our order rate to increase significantly throughout theyear and commensurate with our production levels.",

And I think Zach -- Zachary would like to have some remarks as well.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, thank you, Martin, and thanks, Elon, as well. Overall, as we reflect on the progress of Q1, thiswas one of the most complicated quarters that I can think of in the history of the company. And itwas ambitious even by Tesla's own standard. The global expansion of Model 3 was a huge themewithin the quarter. We launched the Standard Range lineup for Model 3, product retooling forModel S and Model X, which Elon just talked about with the range enhancements and suspensionupgrades, and then we implemented various pricing adjustments and worked to do thecorresponding impact that had on our order mix in deliverable cars. So there's 2 key themes that I'dlike to discuss briefly, and then we'll open it up to Q&A, around cash and profitability for thequarter.First, on the cash front, we exited Q1 with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand. Thiswas a $1.5 billion reduction from our 2018 ending cash balance, but this reduction is attributed to 2factors. The first is that we paid off $920 million convertible note on March 1. Note for those of youlooking to the cash flow statement, $188 million of this is flowing through our operating cash flows.The balance to the $1.5 billion reduction is more than explained by the working capital impact ofexpanding Model 3 operations overseas. And the 2 components to this which we have discussed, isthat an international operation naturally commands additional working capital because of transittimes, but then also the stress on our delivery operations meant that not all of our cars will bedelivered. Both of these factors which occurred in Q1 we do not expect to repeat in Q2.",

        "original_text": "And weexpect our quarter ending cash balance to continue to increase going forward. I'll also note thatwe're tracking in April to the largest amount of deliveries for a month 1 in the history of thecompany.On the working capital point, as Elon noted, 50% of our deliveries in Q1 occurred in the final 10days of the quarter. This is because we prioritized international builds for the first half of the quarterand then U.S. local builds in the second half. This led to a binary inflow of Model 3 cars to EMEAand China and significantly stressed the delivery operations. Note, we also faced import issues inShanghai and Beijing and worked through those, but that also skewed deliveries towards the finalcouple of days and weeks in the quarter. So we're addressing this by regionally on balance -- bybuilding regionally balanced, and we've already executed on this for Model 3, and S and X will beimplemented in the next week or 2.The secondary benefit of this is that it enables us to run stable operations throughout the quarter. Sowe don't have to staff many of our delivery areas and logistic operations to the peak. We expectsignificant cost savings to come from this.On the P&L side, we incurred $188 million of one-time adjustments that flowed through to netincome. $120 million of this was related to S and X pricing adjustments that we announced onFebruary 28. This included a reserve for a potential increased return rate for our Residual ValueGuarantee and Buyback Guarantee of vehicles and also an adjustment for the inventory value of ourused Tesla inventory and service deliveries. There's an additional $67 million related to Q1restructuring and other charges that flowed through.Within the automotive business, one thing that I want to note here is that automotive revenue wasnegatively impacted by $501 million attributed to the reserve increase for S and X that I just noted.If you adjust for this, the decline from Q4 to Q1 in revenue is roughly in line with the decline indeliveries.Within automotive gross margin, Model 3 gross margin declined slightly to approximately 28 -- to20%. This is due to 2 factors. One is the pricing adjustments that we made on February 28 as wellas a mix shift towards the Standard Range lineup which we launched. We also successfullyexecuted on a number of cost reductions which offset this impact.",

Two major pieces here: the volumereduction led to a reduction in fixed cost absorption, so that impacted our margin as well as thepricing actions that we took on February 28. Even though S and X had been in production for awhile, we still continue to make operational improvements there, the labor content as an example,which improved quarter-over-quarter.As we look to the future here, I agree with Elon's sentiments about the excitement of our productlineup. But from a financial standpoint, what we've effectively done here is build an incredible baseof knowledge and assets that we can quickly scale and replicate into different products around theworld.So Gigafactory Shanghai is a terrific example of this. As we noted in the letter, CapEx bringing upcapacity 50% for Giga Shanghai as compared to the Model 3 in the U.S., and that 50%, our internalforecast that we're executing against, is actually better than that.And Model Y , as we've noted, is built on the Model 3 platform, so we're able to leverage theknowledge there for capital-efficient expansion.In energy as well, as we've noted previously, 2019 is a big year for storage, so a lot of excitingimprovements coming there. And the expansion will help improve margin as we can better utilizesome of the assets that we've made investments in that.So just to conclude the opening remarks here, I've personally never felt more excited about thefuture of the company, and I'm looking forward to the discussion.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much, Zachary.

Can you speak to the energy side of the company, specifically theroad map for when you see the energy side of things really taking off and generating major revenuefor the company?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectSure. The challenge really is battery cell scarcity. As far as the stationary storage is concerned, webasically need an upsell to support the vehicle production as well as to both Powerwall andPowerpack. Last year, in order to have enough cells for Model 3, we actually had to convert all ofthe lines of the Gigafactory to produce cells just for the Model 3 as opposed to Powerwall,Powerpack. And so we're essentially scrounging cells from all around the world to, at least,continue some level of production on the Powerwall and Powerpack. This year, we think that we'llbe able to allocate at least maybe 5% to 10% of cell outputs. [I incur] J.B., like what do you guysthink?Jeffrey B. Straubel - Tesla, Inc. - CTOYes.Elon R.

And then we will continue to use cells from various suppliers around theworld. The Powerwall and Powerpack, because they don't have to go through vehicle homologation,are much more adaptable to using a variety of cells from other cell providers. So are we expectingthat Powerwall and Powerpack to see a very significant percentage growth this year, maybe on theorder of 300% or some quite high number. Sorry? Sorry? Yes, 300%. I guess he was just confirmingit, 300%. So this is a very big percentage growth rate. It's much faster than an automotive. So overtime, we would expect that to -- that sort of growth rate we hope will be able to continue and thenbattery storage will become a bigger and bigger percentage of Tesla's business over time. We alsohave -- we're also planning a significant increase in retrofit solar this year because we've finallyrefined the product offering to be something that's extremely compelling and much more costefficient to deliver and install. So a radically streamlined process from what has been done before,and we'll have more to say on that possibly next week. And then the Solar Roof tile, we're onversion 3 of the design. That necessarily takes a while to scale up because we have to be confidentthat the Solar Roof is going to last for on the order of 30 years and because the warranty is sort of20, 25 years.

How soon should current owners that purchased FSD getthe new FSD computer?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI think the -- from features and functionality standpoint, I think there's no point getting the FSDupgrade if you don't really have it in the car for probably about 2 or 3 months. That's when we'llstart releasing features that are materially different from the feature set available on the version 2hardware. So just no need to rush to the -- get your computer replaced. It's like 2 to 3 months beforeit becomes relevant. And then it will obviously increase rapidly from then. One other comment I'llmake in case, since nobody asked this explicitly. For Model Y production, we are right now tryingto decide whether Model Y vehicle production should be in California or Nevada, and we expect tomake a final decision on that very soon. But in the meantime, we have ordered all of the tooling andequipment required for Model Y . So we don't expect this to, in any way, delay production of ModelY , but it's currently a very close call between Nevada and California as to whether we do the ModelY at Giga or at Fremont.

Canyou talk about what is giving you the confidence to project that growth? And in particular what theorder book or reservation list may be telling you?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes. The -- we do see strong demand for vehicles, the -- both S, X and 3. The Standard Range PlusModel 3 with Autopilot included at $39,500 is just an incredibly compelling vehicle and affordableto probably something on the order of like the top 40% income earners in the U.S. and Europe. Soit's -- I think we'll see a lot of interest and demand in that. We are. And then with the upgraded Sand X, I think a lot of people were kind of anticipating that there would be an S, X upgrade, and thisreally is kind of a game changer of an upgrade. So I think we are seeing an uptick in demand, andwe expect to see that to be quite significant. So -- and we're also out of the seasonality of Q1 with afew people just generally don't like buying cars in winter, and we're getting past the overhang ofthat tax credit cliff which, for us, ended in the U.S. on December 31.

A couple of days ago, I asked you how safe is the Autopilot technology andyou said something like twice as safe as normal driving. But you seem to be in a really uniqueposition to really collect exabytes of data and that you can't potentially be externally validated muchmore rigorously provided to a regulatory body or insurance institute to just show how much saferAutopilot is. When can we -- could we expect to see Tesla do that, that type of validation thatinvestors could also get a sense of. It seems really, really important for adoption. And I have afollow-up.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI think we're just going to continue to report the absolute numbers. So I think reporting in detail justgives those who are opposed to Tesla, they can sort of like data mine the situation and then try toturn a positive into a negative. So we're just going to keep reporting what we report. We do givesome more detailed information to insurance companies and to help with rates. And obviously, aswe launch our own insurance product next month, we will certainly incorporate that informationinto the insurance rates. So we can -- because we essentially have a substantial price sort ofarbitrage -- or information arbitrage opportunity where we have direct knowledge of the risk profileof customers and basically the car. And then if they want to buy Tesla insurance, they'd have toagree to not drive the car in a crazy way. Or they can, but then their insurance rates are higher. Sowe're just going to keep reporting the numbers at a broad brush-stroke level, which I think is reallywhat matters. Autopilot...Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDOkay. I understand it.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectThat's for safety.Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - MDOkay. And just a follow-up, Elon, and you kind of alluded to it a little bit. There's just so muchdrama around Tesla's share price and quarterly results. From the outside, at least, it just looks like ahuge distraction. And at the same time, there's so much alternative capital and large amounts ofstrategic capital that is incrementally deployed in domains where Tesla has real leadership.",

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystElon, I was wondering if you could talk about this whole notion of raising capital. For about the lastyear, you sort of eschewed it as almost an evil thing, and I think a lot of investors believe that thecompany might be better served in its growth aspirations if it did raise capital or had a stronger cashbase. And given that you used up about $2 billion worth of cash in the quarter, aren't you potentiallytrying to go through a very thin space while trying to grow quickly and be self-funding, which,quite frankly, may be unrealistic? So why not raise capital? And why do you view that as somethingthat Tesla shouldn't do or wouldn't do? And I have a follow-up, please.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectYes. I don't think raising capital should be a substitute for making the company operate moreeffectively. So that in that sense, I think it's just -- it's important to have a strong financial disciplineof the company and just -- to make sure we don't have extraneous expenses and that we're just beingfrugal with capital. If we just keep raising capital every time, then it just takes -- we don't have theforcing function for improving the fundamental operation of the business.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division - Senior AnalystSo does that mean that investors should expect the capital raise in the near to medium term?

So what is the logic of the price cuts during the quarter?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO, Director & Product ArchitectI mean, our goal, as we've been very clear about from beginning of the company, is to make ourcars as affordable as possible. And we thought it was important to offer the $35,000 Model 3 andthen to create a sort of bundled package for the Model 3 with the increased range because we thinkactually that difference between 220 and 240 is quite important, the more point people realize inrange and having a posher premium interior and then finally, Autopilot. So we thought those -- [likewe went and paired like] product that's really just nailed the sweet spot, which I think the $39,000 --$39,500 Model 3 is just really nailed the sweet spot and we're seeing consumer responseaccordingly. People can still buy the $35,000 version of the Model 3 that, of course, didn't haveAutopilot and has a software range restriction, that kind of thing. It's like slightly more inconvenientto buy. You just have to make a phone call or visit a store. So it's just not like you have to completethe obstacle course or something. But we see very few people actually taking us up on that $35,000offer, but it is there and will remain there.Colin Langan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division - Director in the General IndustrialsGroup and AnalystAnd as a follow-up, you're still targeting the China facility ramp by the end of the year.

Please go ahead, sir.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2020 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ4 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So just to recap the year, 2020 was a defining year for us on many levels. Despite achallenging environment, we reached an important milestone of producing and delivering 0.5million cars. And I'd just like to once again thank the people at Tesla for an incredible effort. Wedelivered almost as many cars last year as we produced in our entire history. So really an incrediblegrowth rate and despite a very challenging 2020. So my hat is off. It's such an honor to work withsuch great people at Tesla.So -- and full year, we achieved free cash flow of nearly $2.8 billion after spending more than $3billion on building new factories and other expenditures. We reached industry-leading GAAPoperating margins in addition to positive net income and record cash flow.Regarding capacity expansion, while we focus on execution, we continue to build a lot of newcapacity. We started producing the Model Y out of Fremont and almost reached full productionspeed. We ramped the Model 3 in Shanghai to more than 5,000 cars a week sustainably, andShanghai continues to grow rapidly. We introduced the heat pump to all of our vehicles.We ramped the single piece -- we started and we're able to ramp to volume production the single-piece castings for Model Y .",

        "original_text": "This is where -- for the first time in history, the entire rear third skeletonof the car is being cast as a single piece in the largest and most advanced casting machine ever made.We built a Model Y factory in China from start to finish in 1 year. We're also building Giga Berlinand Giga Texas, which we expect to start production later this year. And lastly, we built a cell -- abattery cell factory in the Bay Area. And this -- even though it is a pilot plant, it is -- its capacity islarge enough that it would be in the -- probably the top 10 battery cell factories on earth despitebeing a pilot plant.Regarding the new Model S and X, we are launching the -- we're super excited to announce the newModel S and Model X Plaid are in production now and will be delivered in February. So we've beenable to bring forward the Plaid, Model S and X. And so Model S will be delivered in February andModel X a little later. For the Model S Plaid, we're actually in production now and we'll bedelivering next month.So this is a tri-motor Model S with a completely new interior. There are actually a lot of great thingsabout this. I'll do another call about the Model S later. But it's really a tremendous improvementover the prior version.And the Model S will be the first -- this Model S Plaid will be the first production car ever that isable to go 0 to 60 miles an hour in under 2 seconds. So no production car ever has been able to getbelow 2 seconds, 0 to 60. This is a luxury sedan that is able to go 0 to 60 in less than 2 seconds andwill have the ability to seat up to 7 people with the third-row seats.So this is pretty nice. This is faster, to be clear, than any car. It's not like there was a different typeof car, like a 2-door sports car that was able to do fast -- it's the fastest accelerating car ever madefor -- that is allowed to go on roads in history. And like I said, we'll start delivering it in a matter ofweeks.And actually, we'll obviously get into the details what the Model S changes may be later this weekor next. But it's really better in many ways.",

        "original_text": "We will be actually raising the price of Model S forthese new models of -- the old model -- the new model will be $10,000 more. So hopefully, peoplearen't too upset if they bought the old model last month. But this one, $10,000 more. So yes, wethink it's probably the best car of any kind at any price available in the world today.So then with regard to Full Self-Driving, we've made massive progress on Full Self-Driving. Irecommend watching the videos of our public beta. So we've got, I think, almost 1,000 people inthe beta at this point. And with each successful release of the beta FSD software, it just gets -- it'sreally improving rapidly. It's not very common for -- I drive the latest roads.It's very common for me to have no interventions on drives that I do, including drives to a place thatI've never been to. So these are not preplanned routes. The car has never been there before. And it'snow actually more -- it's more common than not for the car to have no interventions, even on acomplex drive. So -- and this is -- basically, I'm highly confident the car will be able to drive itselfwith reliability in excess of human this year. This is a very big deal.And thinking about like how does one justify the value of the company being where it is, I thinkthere is a way, just with back-of-the-envelope math, to potentially justify it, where if Tesla ships,let's say, hypothetically, $50 billion or $60 billion worth of vehicles and those vehicles become FullSelf-Driving and can be used in robotaxis -- used as robotaxis, the utility increases from an averageof 12 hours a week to potentially an average of 60 hours a week if they're capable of serving asrobotaxi. So that's like roughly a 5x increase in utility.But let's -- even if you say like, okay, let's just assume that the car becomes twice as useful as -- not5x as useful but merely twice as useful, that would be a doubling again of the revenue of thecompany, which is almost entirely gross margin. So it would mean -- it would be like if you made$50 million -- $50 billion worth of cars, it will be like having [$50 million] of incremental profitbasically from that because of the software.So -- and if that was the case, then yes, you get 20 PE on that.",

So I think there is a way to sort of like justify the valuation of thecompany where it is using just the cars and nothing else, the cars with FSD. And I suspect at least anumber of investors are taking that approach.So in conclusion, while 2020 was a turning point for Tesla in terms of profitability, we believe thisis just the beginning. We think 2021 is going to be even more exciting. And you don't know what toexpect in a given year. Obviously, last year, we did not -- there were many things we did not expect.But assuming that '21 is a relatively normal year from an external standpoint, I think it's going to bea great year for Tesla.We've got a ton of -- many great new products coming out. We've got factories that are -- advancedfactories that can start production. It will also make it easier how you're having a factory in Berlin,one, and in Texas second, just from a logistics standpoint. And Texas can help supply the Easternhalf of the U.S. and Berlin can help supply Europe. And there's just fewer cars on boats, much lesscapital tied up with built cars that are on boats or going -- being transported to customers. And Ithink the fundamental efficiency of the company will be much better with the factories -- at leasthaving factories on each continent and having 2 factories in the U.S.So I'm super excited about the future, and yes, we look forward to making it happen.

        "original_text": "Inaddition, auto gross margin, excluding credits, improved from 2019 to 2020 despite reductions inASP and inefficiencies from new product launches and transitions.On Q4 specifically, this was a noisy quarter. So let's unpack a few things. Stock-based compincreased, part of which is driven by the rise of the stock price over the course of our 2020employee performance grant process, and a portion of which is unique to Q4 only. The impact ofSBC increases is seen across both COGS as well as operating expenses.Automotive gross margin in Q4 was primarily impacted by 2 things. First, we invested in improvingour products built in Fremont, including converting over to the new Model S and Model X,launching the single-piece castings on Model Y and introducing heat pump on Model 3. Second,logistics and labor costs were impacted due to supply chain instability and pandemic inefficiencies.Adjusting for items such as these, as we do in our internal management views, we saw animprovement in auto gross margin.Our services and other P&L was impacted by many of the same factors just mentioned, includingonboarding costs associated with new service capacity. However, what's most important here is thatwe've accelerated the growth in service capacity and will continue to drive capacity expansion asfast as possible.On energy gross margin, we saw an impact from Solar Roof-related ramp costs and typicalseasonality in the lease/PPA business. OpEx as a percentage of revenue continues to reduce despiteimpacts from items mentioned as well as increased investment in development of future products.Finally, the early settlement of our convertible notes resulted in an additional $100 million ofinterest expense for the quarter. All that being said, nothing has changed about our view thatoperating margin will continue to grow and remain industry-leading.As we look forward, 2021 may be our most meaningful step forward yet as we see the benefits oflong-standing investments in capacity and technology. The range of possible outcomes this year iswide given the magnitude of launches.There's a few things we should keep in mind. We continue to expect a long-term volume CAGR of50%, of which we may materially exceed this in 2021. As we increase production rates, volumeswill skew towards the second half of the year, and ramp inefficiencies will be a part of this year'sstory and are necessary to achieve our long-term goals. Specifically for Q1, our volumes will havethe benefit of early Model Y ramp in Shanghai.",

And now we can jump straight into questions from Say Technologies.The first question from institutional investors is, what is currently holding Tesla back from beingthe market share leader in solar?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So we're actually seeing tremendous growth in solar quarter-over-quarter last year. And we hadour best quarter since, I think, 2018 in Q4. So we do expect to become the market share leader insolar and then go far beyond it. It's -- unfortunately, there were a few years there where we had todevote the whole company to Model 3 production and building. And so we actually basically takethe whole company, including a lot of people that were on solar, and have them work on cars. Butnow we got a little more bandwidth, we're putting a lot of attention on solar, and it is growingrapidly. So I think it will not be long before Tesla is, by far, the market leader in solar.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOAnother really important part of the solar strategy is achieving an industry-leading cost structure,which then allows us to have industry-leading pricing. And so that's something that we'veaccomplished over the last year in terms of getting the cost structure in the place that it needs to be.And as Elon mentioned, this is a really important part with industry-leading pricing to become theleader in the space.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And actually, an important part is achieving better integration between the Tesla Powerwalland the Tesla retrofit solar and Tesla roof. And we're confident we'll have excellent integration --excellent integration with the Powerwall and Tesla Solar, whether it's retrofit or the Tesla SolarglassRoof before the end of the year.So it's really -- I think we've got a good strategy.

As I'm saying, it's not remarkable at all for the car tocompletely drive you from one location to another through a series of complex intersections. It'snow about just improving the corner case reliability and getting it to 99.9999% reliable with respectto an accident.Basically, we need to get it to better than human by a factor of at least 100% or 200%. And this ishappening rapidly because we've got so much training data with all cars in the field. And thesoftware is improving dramatically. The -- we also write the software for labeling. And I'll say it'squite challenging. We're moving everything towards video labeling. So it's all video labeling, allvideo inference. And so there are still a few of the neural nets that need to be upgraded to videotraining and video inference. And really, as we transition each net to video, the performancesbecome exceptional.So this is like a hot thing. The video -- the labeling software that we work for, video labeling,making that better has a huge effect on the efficiency of labeling. And then, of course, the holy grailis auto labeling. So we're putting a lot of work into having the labeling tool be more efficient whenused by a person as well as enabling auto labeling where we can.Dojo is a sort of training supercomputer. We believe it will be -- we think it may be the best neuralnet training computer in the world by possibly an order of magnitude. So it is a whole thing in andof itself. And this is something we can offer potentially as a service. So some of the others needneural net training.

And as you've said before, with the S-curve of production, you can be off alittle bit on the initial part of the S-curve, and that makes a difference in absolute capacity by quite abit 1 month to the next. So yes, I mean we are progressing up that S-curve as fast as we possiblycan.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. And we don't see any showstoppers.Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. And one more question is from the retail investors. What is Tesla doing toimprove service experience? Tesla had a reputation for outstanding customer service. Now it'simpossible to even call a service center, and appointments are scheduled weeks out. Jerome?Jerome Guillen - Tesla, Inc. - President of Automotive DivisionYes. Well, as far as best service, no service, so we spent a lot of efforts trying to improve the qualityand the reliability of our cars. In the last 2 years, the frequency of service visits are reduced by 1/3.So people have to -- customers have to come less frequently in service, which is really the goal, noservice. And if service has to take place, we are trying to make it as painless as possible.One big effort there is to increase mobile service, which is now more than 40% of all visits in NorthAmerica. We're trying to push that to 50% this year. And 50% of service visits last less than 2hours. So we're trying to service the cars very quickly so people can get their vehicles back on theroad.And in terms of service appointment, it continues to improve. We have about -- we have actually140 service centers right now in North America.",

In North America, we opened11 centers in December, and we have plans to open 46 in the first half of this year. So that's whatwe're doing to improve service.In terms of phones, our emphasis is on the app. Really, we want all communications to go throughthe app, the Tesla app, and we're trying to move away from the phone. The app is much better thanthe phone. It can start directly -- alerts directly from the car and schedule a service appointment.And there is a written record of all communication between the customer and the service team. Youcan have pictures in there. You can take care of your payment without entering the credit card anddoing all that stuff. You get updates on the service.And there is even more features that are going to come in the coming months on the app. And Ithink everybody will be happy, including the ability to spot where your service technician is andhow far it is to coming from your car and what's going on there.

The question numberone, what are the key milestones we need to achieve in order to evolve current FSD to a commercialLevel 4, Level 5 ridesharing solution?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. So it really goes back to what I was saying a moment ago, which is we need to transition overthe neural nets in the car to video. And in order to do that, the whole stack has to be -- the wholestack has to be changed to video. That means gathering video clips than using -- and this is actuallysurround video. So you've got 8 cameras operating simultaneously with synchronized frame rates.So you've got basically 8-frame surround video -- 8-camera surround video.",

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, it is. So the fundamental limit on electric vehicles right now, in general, is total availability ofcells, what's the output of factory cells in gigawatt hours. And you can't grow faster than that. Nowat Tesla, we've improved the efficiency of our cars dramatically such that you can actually get apretty good range even with the Standard Range battery pack.It's in the high -- it's approaching -- for Model 3, it's approaching the sort of high 200s. And withsome slight continued improvements, we'll start to get to a 300-mile range even with the Standardpack, an order of 500 kilometers. So there's efficiency improvements in the car. But fundamentally,the growth is dependent on cell production. And there's obviously a lot of other companies thatwant to -- that have a need for cells.So -- but the reason Tesla is doing its own cell production is in order to accelerate the growth. It isnot to make less use of our cell suppliers.",

But what we're going to expect is to have to workwith regulators to demonstrate really, really high reliability, as Elon said before.The rest of the world is fairly dynamic. In Europe, we see a general slowdown, generally notreaching past Level 3 right now with some impetus to start working on new working groups toreach past that. And China showed an interest in working on Level 4 or even Level 5 later this year.So we expect a pretty dynamic 2021 in the regulatory space.

First, on '21, any expectations for what we shouldsee on regulatory credit sales? And then the second question is on capital. Obviously, you raised alot of capital in 2020. What should we think about the use of those funds beyond just covering someof the maturities? And can you just give us a sense of what the elevated liquidity does and doesn'tbuy? Meaning to what extent does elevated capital enable you to accelerate plans on buildingcapacity or expanding vertical integration, accelerating timing on full self-drive features? So thoseare the questions.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. On the regulatory credit sales side, this is always an area that's extremely difficult for us toforecast. 2020 regulatory credit sales ended up being higher than our expectations. And it's difficultto give guidance on that.I mean what I said before is that in the long term, regulatory credit sales will not be a material partof the business, and we don't plan the business around that. It's possible that for a handful ofadditional quarters, it remains strong. It's also possible that it's not.Most of our regulatory credit revenue from Q4 was not lined up prior to the beginning of thequarter. And these were discrete deals that were struck over the course of the quarter. So I wish Icould give you more on this, Dan, but it's a space that's extraordinarily difficult for us to forecast.On the second side, with respect to capital, a couple of things that we're thinking through there. Soas I mentioned in my opening remarks, debt reduction is an important thing that we're focused onnow.Early conversions, these are things we don't have a choice on. We did around $2 billion of that inQ4. We currently have $1.4 billion that we expect to go out in Q1 as a result of early conversions orconversions on convertible debt. That number may increase. And so debt reduction is important.That's helpful on interest expense as well.We are also using the money with respect to our investments in future capacity.",

And so this is an important part in terms of capital efficiency thatwe haven't had the luxury to do in the past, and it's great to be able to have the liquidity to focus onthat.And then more broadly, as Jerome was touching on, service expansion is really important to thefuture strategy of the company. So as you saw in our Q4 numbers, the expansion of service centersand mobile service from Q3 to Q4 increased quite a bit and was also quite a bit higher than the firstpart of the year.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think Tesla is definitely going to make an electric van at some point. The thing to bear in mind isthat there is fundamentally a constraint on battery cell output. It's like -- if one is not involved inmanufacturing, it's really hard to appreciate just how hard it is to scale production. It's the hardestthing in the world. Prototypes are easy. Scaling production is very hard.So a big part of the reason -- the main reason we have not accelerated new products is -- like, forexample, Tesla Semi, is that we simply don't have enough cells built. Like we -- this -- if we were tomake the Semi like right now, which we could easily go into production with the Semi, but wewould not have enough to cells for it right now. We will have cells -- enough cells for Semi whenwe were producing the 4680 in volume. But for example, Semi would use typically 5x the numberof cells that a car would use, but it would not sell for 5x what a car would sell for.So it kind of doesn't make -- it would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now, but it willabsolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint.

It's coming along well and it's in good shape.But since we can achieve FSD, Full Self-Driving, with the current system, it would actually be adistraction right now if we were to introduce the Full Self-Driving -- the Tesla FSD chip 2 becauseit would set us back quite a bit on software. And software is the critical path to Full Self-Driving.So I wouldn't worry too much about that. That's not a -- that's an improvement but not a gamechanger, the FSD 2.

So in addition to building upcapacity, some of the goals you highlighted was to cut the pricing or the cost by about 50%, boostthe range by about 50% over a number of years. So wanted to know if your initial efforts aretrending in that direction. What is sort of like the time line to achieve these goals? And mayberelated to this, how are you thinking about the time line for the cheaper Tesla, the entry model,eventually?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI mean I think we feel very confident about achieving those targets, let's say, over a 3-year timeframe. I don't know. Drew? It's not like year 1.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think that's quite likely, yes. Yes, I can't imagine -- I'm not sure who would be #2, but yes, it seemshighly likely, yes.Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-Founder & Head ofResearchOkay.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. That's true, yes. As it is, we need to modify the parameters. Software parameters change forAutopilot or Full Self-Driving because it needs to know if it's in a Model 3, Model Y , Model X orModel S. And so this is -- we just need to inform the vehicle -- inform the Full Self-Driving brainthat it is now in a Semi truck.Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-Founder & Head ofResearchWould it need to be retrained then as part of that?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorNo. I think there will be -- you have different control functions because there are turns that youcould do in a regular car that you cannot do in a Semi. Like you don't want to try to parallel parkthis thing on the street in a city. It needs to know its limitations being a giant truck.Charles Eugene Munster - Loup Ventures, LLC - Managing Partner, Co-Founder & Head ofResearchMakes sense. My follow-up question was related to if you could just help us explain why batteryelectric will win versus hydrogen cell fuel tech.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes.

Please go ahead, sir.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2019Q&A Webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of otherexecutives.Our Q4 results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published atthe same link as this webcast.During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThanks, Martin. So Q4 was another strong quarter for the company. Deliveries reached over112,000 vehicles in a single quarter. It's hard to think of a similar product with such strong demandthat it can generate more than $20 billion in revenue with 0 advertising spend. I think that's -- wherewe do say that from time to time, I think it's often overlooked, but to have the highest-demandelectric vehicle in the world with no advertising spend is, I think, quite remarkable and speaks tothe nature of the product and the fact that the product itself is compelling enough to generate thatdemand without a bunch of advertising.At our Fremont factory, we're producing at a rate roughly the same as the NUMMI factory did in itsrecord year of 2006. And obviously, we expect to exceed that significantly this year. This rate ofproduction was [cheap] before we even started to produce the Model Y out of Fremont. So there's alot of potential to go beyond that number.For the Shanghai factory, I'd like to say congratulations again to the team in Shanghai on launchingModel 3 last quarter and achieving the first deliveries earlier this year. I'm really excited and optimistic about the potential for the Shanghai factory. I think it's going to be an incredible asset tothe company. And we also broke ground on the Model Y factory in Shanghai. So a lot of goodprogress there.Regarding Model Y , it was only 10 months ago that we revealed a Model Y prototype.",

And we managed to achieve, by far, the highest energyefficiency of any electric SUV ever produced at 4.1 miles per kilowatt hour, which means Model Yall-wheel drive got an EPA rating of 315 miles. This improvement is reflected on the configurator asof today. This is above what we've previously stated by a pretty significant margin. And then justwith great acceleration, top speed, it's really just incredible specs all around.For the Cybertruck, a few months ago, we revealed the -- obviously, remember, we revealed theCybertruck, that was -- that went viral. And we tried to build a product that -- a product that issuperior in every way without any preconceptions of how such a product should look. So it reallyjust -- from the standpoint of what's the most badass, futuristic, armored personnel carrier that kicksthe ass of any other pickup truck, basically that's the goal. And we wanted it to look like somethingthat just kind of came out of a sci-fi movie set from the future. And the demand has been incredible.We've never seen actually such a level of demand at this -- we've never seen anything like it,basically. I think we will make as -- about as many as we can sell for many years. So as many -- wewill sell as many as we can make. It's going to be pretty nuts. So -- and I think, actually, the productis better than people realize even. They don't even have enough information to realize just theawesomeness of it. It's just great.So -- and then stepping back in 2018, from a financial standpoint, we were -- free cash flow ratewas breakeven. But in 2019, we managed to generate more than $1 billion of free cash flow whilebuilding a factory in Shanghai in record time and while building parts of Model Y in production. SoI think for us to have this level of free cash flow while making massive investments in capacitywhile developing new products, while improving the core engineering, is a testament to the, I think,incredible performance of the Tesla team.

Thanks, Martin. This past year was truly transformational for Tesla, and I want to thankeveryone who's been a part of making this happen.On 2019, a few key points I'd like to highlight. On demand, while we've mentioned this a fewtimes, it's worth highlighting once again. Over the course of the year, we've transitioned entirelyfrom generating Model 3 orders from a reservation backlog to generating new and organic demand.We've also seen a stabilization of Model 3 ASPs, even increasing slightly in Q4. And we've seen anincrease in ASPs of S and X after the launch of the longer-range versions in Q2.With respect to capacity expansion, we've greatly learned from the development and launch ofModel 3 in Fremont and Reno. As a result, we've been able to bring new production capacity onboard faster and with less cost. This is evidenced by the launch of Model 3 in Shanghai as well asModel Y in Fremont, programs that were both launched in under one year.Financially, we have demonstrated multiple quarters of strong cash generation, enabled throughhigher volumes, improvements to capital efficiency, progress on working capital management andcontinued improvement in our product and operational costs. And we are able to achieve positiveGAAP net income in both Q3 and Q4 for many of the same reasons that enabled strong cashgeneration.",

We are going to take the first questions from retail investors compiled by SayTechnologies.So the first retail investor question is, \"since solar is required for all new home constructions inCalifornia, do you have any substantial orders for Solarglass Roofs from any of the large Californiahomebuilders that you can share? What's the 2020 target for the number of Solarglass Roofinstallations in California?\"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I think we do -- we are seeing, mostly from a small base, exponential growth in demand andoutput for solar -- for the Solarglass Roof. So it's difficult to predict what the demand will be thisyear, except that the demand is very strong. And we are working also not just through Tesla SolarRoof but also through new homebuilders and through just the roofing industry in general, whetherit's in North America, on the order of 4 million new roofs per year. So we see a lot of interest.And so it's just a question of refining the installation process, getting lots of crews trained to do theinstallation. But over time, I would expect a significant percentage of new roofs to be something touse Solarglass in one form or another. It's really going to be a choice of do you want a roof that isalive with power or dead without. And I think people will want a live roof that generates power andlooks good and lasts a long time, and it's the future we want.So it will be a significant product, but because it is a new and quite revolutionary product andthere's a lot of challenges to overcome, but they will be overcome, and this will be a major productline of Tesla. And the Buffalo factory is doing great. So, yes.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. And the second question from retail shareholders is, \"will you release the Tesla ride-hailing network app before full autonomy and change the terms of Tesla Insurance to allow ownersto be drivers on the network?

Next question from retail investors is, \"how many California owners are currentlyinsured with Tesla Insurance? What's the target for Tesla Insurance in 2020? When will you start tosignificantly leverage the data you have from the fleet to lower the cost of your coverage? Will weget premium discount of certain percent?\"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean, go ahead, Zach.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. So Tesla Insurance is currently available in California. A couple of things that we're workingon, on this front. The first is to expand it to other locations. And we're preparing the regulatoryprocesses -- preparing our processes to go through the regulatory processes in those locations. We'realso working on the processes to continue to adjust our rates in California, which also have to gothrough regulatory processes as insurance is quite heavily regulated. And that's where we'respending our time focusing on Tesla Insurance right now. There's a significant amount ofinnovation, as we've discussed before in this space, exactly getting to the intent of what the questionhere is, using our technology to reduce rates. And this will be rolled in over time.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThe last part of the question was, will there be a discount for using Autopilot with our cars?Elon R.

But I think it would make sense for us to close loop on higher use of Autopilot for it reducesthe insurance cost as well as the probability of injury. So I think insurance is going to be, I think,quite a major product of Tesla over time. The amount of money that people spend on car insuranceis like a remarkably big percentage of the cost of a car. You can lease a Model 3 right now for $400a month, but a typical owner in California will be paying sort of between $100 and $200 a month ininsurance.So we're talking about something which is maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of the cost of the lease of the car isinsurance. And a lot of that insurance cost is just because the insurance companies don't have goodinformation about the drivers. And there's no good way to provide feedback, where it's a very poorfeedback mechanism in terms of the insurance rates versus the actual way that the car is beingdriven, whereas we can do that in real time. It's a fundamental information advantage that insurancecompanies don't have.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you. The next question is, \"you set expectations that you would be feature-complete on FSDby the end of 2019. Can you please provide an update on when will we see this with end users?Where are you in retrofitting the FSD computer to older models?\"Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, I mean to be precise, I said I was hoping it would be feature-complete with most FSD by theend of last year. We got pretty close. It's looking like we might be feature-complete in a fewmonths. Feature-complete means just like it has some chance of going from your home to work,let's say, with no interventions. So that's -- it doesn't mean the features are working well, but itmeans it has above 0 chance. So I think that's looking like maybe it's going to be a couple of monthsfrom now.And -- but what isn't obvious regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving is just how much work hasbeen going into improving the foundational elements of autonomy.",

But -- and you can basically run down an entire list of COGS between labor cost, materialcost due to localization. So it's opening up suppliers that would not have made economic sense fromthe States. Localizing the supply chain flows into inbound logistics and outbound logistics costs aswell. So we're not shipping cars from California over to China. And then that has a correspondingsavings on our lower import-related costs.And there's a slide in the shareholder letter that shows the layout comparison between our Fremontfacility here in California and also the Model 3 factory in China. And the simplification in terms ofthe flow is pretty evident from that layout, and that cascades itself into all sorts of savings for theoperations of the facility.And so if you add all of this up, our internal estimates are a pretty significant reduction in the costof Model 3 in China relative to Fremont. But I think it's also important to keep in mind that the costof the Standard Plus that we're selling out of Shanghai is also lower than that of the similar carcoming out of Fremont, from price perspective. And so -- and I've said this on previous earningscalls, I think it's fair to expect the margin coming out of the Shanghai facility to match the samemargin for the vehicle in Fremont.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes.

And how shouldwe think about OpEx needs as we grow both vehicles and geographic workloads?\"Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. I commented briefly on this in my opening remarks. We did see an increase in operatingexpenses from Q3 to Q4, even excluding the portion of that attributed to stock-based compensation.And when you double click into that growth, it's supporting the Model Y program and alsoShanghai program as well.And so I think we, as a company, are now at the point where we've learned a lot on cost efficiency,as I've just mentioned. And we've unwound a number of the processes that were not in the rightplace, including automating with things that need to be automated. And we'll continue on thatjourney.

So thething we're going to be really focused on is increasing battery production capacity because that'svery fundamental because if you don't improve battery production capacity, then you end up justshifting unit volume from one product to another, and you haven't actually produced more electricvehicles.So that's part of the reason why we have not, for example, really accelerated production of the TeslaSemi because it does use a lot of cells. And unless we've got a lot of battery cells available, then saylike accelerated production of the Tesla Semi would then necessarily mean making fewer Model 3or Model Y cars. So we've got to really make sure we get a very steep ramp in battery productionand continue to improve the cost per kilowatt hour of the batteries.

Are there other features that are going to differentiate the2 models? And then as a follow-on to that, you've talked in the past about how Model S sales grewwith the introduction of Model X. So are you planning on setting up your production facilities toalign with that thesis that essentially Model 3 sales will expand alongside the introduction of ModelY?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWe're not quite sure what's going to happen, but it is true that Model X -- the introduction of ModelX actually increased Model S sales because people would come in and look at the Model X andthey like said, \"okay, I prefer the sedan.\" And we're worried that X sales would cause S sales todrop but it actually caused it to increase. So from -- like I said, we're not too worried about demand.We're worried about production, make sure we get that production ramp going and reach volumeproduction as soon as possible with Model Y .And it's hard to -- it's always hard to predict what that S -- the exponential part of the S-curve ofproduction. Our production pretty much always follows this S-curve, or it's kind of like a herkyjerky S-curve. And you can -- it's easy to predict what it's going to be like in beginning because it'slow, and it's easy to predict what it's going to be like at the end, but that intermediate portion of theS-curve is very difficult to predict. So that's -- and it involves a massive amount of hard work andjust reacting fast to issues that arise.So yes, I think we'll just go as fast as we can with Model Y and make sure it's a great product.

Our order rate supports the pricing that we have right now. We're workingvery hard to reduce costs and expand production because, I mean, we feel from the data, it's prettyclear that there's a lot of interest in our products. And so what we're working on is to increaseproduction, increase availability of the products with time. And the price reduction in China, kindof the first step towards this global localization, more accessible price. And we'll continue to workon cost reductions in China as we do in Fremont and grow production.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean the thing that's really going to, I think, probably just have a profound effect on ourfinancials is like -- is high volume and high margin, obviously. And that high margin part comesfrom autonomy. So do people buy the Full Self-Driving package or not and do they buy itworldwide or only in certain places? For example, our autonomy is not as good in China as it is inthe U.S. So fewer people -- a very small percentage of people buy the FSD package in China.But as we fix that, then we will see a much higher people -- percentage of people buying. And as weare close to Full Self-Driving, that's just going to become more and more compelling.

Please go ahead, sir.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2020 Q&AWebcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. OurQ1 results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at thesame link as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. So Q1 ended up being a strong quarter despite many challenges in the final few weeks.This is the first time we have achieved positive GAAP net income in a seasonally weak first quarter.Even with all the challenges, we achieved a 20% automotive gross margin, excluding regulatorycredits, while ramping 2 major products. What we've learned from this is that -- we've obviouslylearned a lot here. After all -- after the Model 3 ramp from 3 years ago, our new products get runfaster and become profitable sooner. In Q1, we produced more Model Ys in the first quarter thanModel 3s in Fremont in the first 2 quarters. Thus far, the Model Y ramp has been even faster thanthe Giga Shanghai ramp in Q1. Most surprisingly is, otherwise, we are ahead of the schedule thatwe were ahead of already. Most surprisingly -- Model Y was profitable already in its first quarter ofproduction, something we haven't achieved with any product in the past.Regarding Autopilot, we released a new software update for traffic lights and stop signs to earlyaccess users in March and to all U.S. customers with Full Self-Driving package just last week. Ourcars will now automatically stop at each stop sign or traffic lights until the driver gets aconfirmation to proceed.",

So this is -- we can almost do this already with theleading-edge alpha builds driving in the car.So let's see, on other technology fronts, we increased the range of Model S and X yet again, thistime to 391 miles for Model S and 351 miles for Model X. Actually, we said that, actually, themodel -- the real Model S range is 400 miles. But when we did the last EPA test, unfortunately, EPAhad left the car door opened and the keys in the car. So the car -- and they did this overnight. And sothe car actually went into waiting-for-driver mode and lost 2% of its range and, as a result, had a391 test.",

But to be clear, the Model S forthe past 2 months -- the true range of the Model S for the past 2 months has been 400 miles. And ofcourse, we're not stopping there. We're looking -- we're going to continue pushing for improvedrange over time and improving handling, acceleration and all the little details that make Teslaspecial.For Model Y , we introduced a revolutionary 2-piece rear underbody casting, but we are going to bemaking a single-piece casting later this year, meaning like essentially the rear third of the body iscast as a single piece, which is no casting of this size and complexity has ever been done before. Infact, there isn't even anything that is on par with the 2-piece casting for the Model Y . So we're reallypushing the envelope on vehicle structural engineering and manufacturing. I'm very excited aboutthis approach as it allows us to reduce the weight of the cast and improve NVH. It's better in everyway, essentially.We also -- for Model Y , we also introduced a revolutionary new heat pump, which allows the car tohave a higher range. So the Model Y has remarkable range, on par with -- in fact, slightly betterthan, I guess, the Model 3, and despite being a bigger car that weighs more. And the heat pump is akey contributor to that. It is especially excellent at low-temperature driving. So -- and the feedbackwe're getting from customers who have received the Model Y thus far has been universally positive.We're confident this product will be our best-selling product ever.So in conclusion, and just looking -- I guess this is a forward-looking statement, we are absolutelycontinuing our Model Y capacity expansion at full speed at both Giga Berlin and Giga Shanghai,and here in Fremont when they will let us continue. Localized production in China and in Europewill bring the costs down, making our products even more competitive over time. While many othercompanies are cutting back on investment, we are doing the opposite. We are absolutely pedal tothe metal on new products and expanding the company.",

And now to Zach's opening remarks.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. Thanks, Martin, and thanks, Elon. I'm very proud of the accomplishments of the Tesla teamthis past quarter. A few things to highlight and add to what Elon just mentioned. We successfullylaunched, ramped and demonstrated profitability of the Model Y , as Elon mentioned, significantlyahead of schedule. This is our second large-scale product launch since Model 3 in 2017, and it'sevidence to the progress we've made on cost control and ramp efficiency. It's hard to understate thesignificance of demonstrating profitability of this program in its first quarter of production.Our Shanghai Model 3 margins improved dramatically since Q4 of last year, nearing equivalents ofModel 3s built in Fremont. This is despite not yet running at full capacity while also managingthrough the production shutdown in early February. We also announced a long-range andperformance variant of Model 3 for our road map, which will positively impact ASPs in China.On order rates, we did not experience much of an impact related to the expiration of governmentincentives at the end of Q4. In fact, we exited the quarter with our highest-ever backlog yet again.Aided by these accomplishments, we are able to achieve our first-ever Q1 profit. Automotive grossmargin, excluding the impact of regulatory credits, remained strong for all products despite chargestaken in Q1 associated with production downtime. We continue to make progress on OpExefficiency as well as our service and other margins. Our energy business was impacted as well byshutdown activities in Q1, limiting deployments. We also experienced expected launchinefficiencies associated with our third version of the Solar Roof, which impacted overallprofitability.As I've noted before, we expect regulatory credit sales, which are credits we sell to other carmakers,to generally increase with time. This can be seen by the increase from Q1 relative to Q4.",

More broadly, we remain focused on ensuring our cash flows aremanaged appropriately. Working capital management, in particular raw material inventory, is thesingle most important lever in managing our cash flows during this time. The Tesla team has done agreat job here.

The first question from institutional investor is, most Tesla owners have yet topurchase or experience FSD despite most vehicles having all the necessary hardware. What leverscould you pull to accelerate adoption and deepen your data advantage? For example, could youconsider offering FSD as a premium subscription?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we will offer Full Self-Driving as a subscription service, but it will be probably towards theend of this year. I should say it will still make sense to buy FSD as an option as, in our view, buyingFSD is an investment in the future. And we are confident that it is an investment that will pay off tothe consumer and to the benefit of the consumer. In my opinion, buying FSD option is somethingpeople will not regret doing.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOI agree. And financially, rolling the upfront purchase of your -- of the FSD option into a loan in thevehicle or a lease is -- will be the least expensive plan on a monthly basis to own, plus you preservethe option value of increased value of time. But we do understand that some customers who haveownership or have leased their vehicles did not purchase that option upfront. And so this will enablethose customers to spread out the cost of ownership of FSD or subscription over time.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely. As you may be like, at a high level, our overall goal is to maximize the area underthe curve of customer happiness. That is our goal. And we think that that's the kind of thing that allcompanies should try to do. And it's what results in long-term value creation. And loyalty begetsloyalty. So our goal is always really to do the best thing for the customers, and we're confident thatif we behave like that, the customers in turn will behave the same way to us.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you.

And on the manufacturing cost portion of the question, the cost of vehicles produced inShanghai in Q1 is already lower than the cost to produce the Model 3 in Fremont, and there's stillsignificant opportunity left to take cost out. So our fixed cost absorption from higher productionvolumes, which are occurring in Q2, will occur through the rest of the year. We're not fullylocalized on the supply chain yet.

And the last question from institutional investors, could you please update on progresstowards development and commercialization of Full Self-Driving? How much revenue have yourecognized so far?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSo there's a couple of things on the financials for Full Self-Driving. So currently, in North America,it's sold for $7,000 as an option. We take roughly half of that as revenue, and the other half of itgoes into deferred revenue. That's associated with features that will be released with time. Ourdeferred revenue balance is continuing to grow. It's a little bit over $600 million. And so as werelease features with time, at the end of every quarter, we take a look at what features have beenreleased, the associated value, and then we can release that from the deferred revenue into ourfinancials for that quarter. And then cars going forward, once the feature is released, we canrecognize that revenue. So we reduce the amount of deferral, and we can recognize that revenuewithin period. So I mean, this is one of what we think will be one of the most powerful grossmargin levers with time as the feature suite is rolled out.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorAbsolutely. There's also a tremendous amount of untapped potential in the fleet out there that couldupgrade to turn on Autopilot -- basic Autopilot or Full Self-Driving. And that's something that wewill enable just as simple in-app purchase or as we talked about earlier, just towards the end of theyear, as a subscription. So that's just a lot of untapped potential there.

And the last question from retail is, when will Tesla start acquiring utilities like theHornsdale Power Reserve and Moss Landing instead of selling them battery storage? Does it makesense for Tesla to buy bigger plants and convert them? Elon Musk: It's not out of the question, but our brand is full."

So $8.1 billion in cash and cashequivalents at the end of Q1, we're managing it very closely. As I mentioned in my openingremarks, we do have an increase in inventory of vehicles that we were unable to deliver at the endof Q1. So we're making progress delivering those through April, which is helpful for liquidity. Andas we've been looking at liquidity, we've been looking at this over the next 18 months. And there'sups and downs to the liquidity. Currently now, as we're not producing, we still have payables fromQ1 that we're paying off. But then in a couple of months, we'll quickly be through that, and thenwe'll have a gap in payables since we don't have any parts coming in. So it does go up and down alittle bit. But in looking at the long-term horizon, which is how we're managing it right now, we feelpretty comfortable with the liquidity position of the company.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I should say we are a bit worried about not being able to resume production in the Bay Area,and that should be identified as a serious risk.

How much of it is a function of thecommonality with the Model 3? What other factors should we think about? And what does thatmean for the ampler for the eventual gross margin on Model Y?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorZach?Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSure. A couple of thoughts there for Y . The first is it does carry a higher ASP. So on the revenueside, it carries a higher ASP than Model 3. And the deliveries that we started with were of thehigher ASP versions of the cars. So we started with deliveries of performance initially. And so thathelps create some of the margin. And that will come down with time as more variants are released,and we have more of a steady-state mix. But it's similar to the ASP trends that we had with Model 3when we launched that product in Fremont 2 years ago.On the cost side, I think you hit on a couple of the buckets. The commonality is huge. It's veryimportant. And in addition to that, manufacturing processes are very similar to Model 3 as well.And so we have experience with that, both with Model 3 in Fremont and then as well in Shanghai.And it helps to have an existing factory with existing workforce and knowledge here as well. So theecosystem to support and launch the product is there. There remain a lot of opportunities to take --continue to take cost out of the car. And the number of vehicles that we built in the first quarter isquite limited relative to our goal.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, agree.

Are you going to gradually take over human routes withautonomous capable routes over time? Or how do you see that playing out?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, it's pretty much going to play out as it has played out, which is we'll release more and morefunctionality. Before we release any functionality, it goes through extensive testing. And of course,we run it -- we have a simulations team that has, I think, a very good simulation of the real world.So we run any car changes through a battery test and simulation. Then we have a global QA team,which I'm on actually, I'm one of -- on the global QA team. And we test the releases in the realworld, in the real-world map, [then if it fits] in the real world and the simulation, which is -- whichare very many because the world is very complex anyway. And then we release it to a small groupof private beta testers within the company; then to a larger beta audience, including people outsidethe company; then to Early Access Tesla owners; and then, finally, a broad release. And so there aremany stages that these things go through. So by the time something is being -- going to a widerelease into the U.S., it has gone through all of those stages. And the software that's at the very earlystage is much more advanced than what people are seeing.So it just got to go through a very rigorous safety process. So essentially, we need to figure out --get very good at complex intersections, get very good at complex turns and intersections and thingslike busy malls, in a parking lot or office park or special events and sporting events, that kind ofthing, when those eventually come back.

Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOne on gross margin, first, and your impressive performance in Q1. So there are 3 moving parts: thetailwind from credits, of course; the Model Y ramping, even if it broke even, it probably tookaverage gross margin down; and of course, you had like Fremont being closed, shut down the lastweek of the quarter, it probably was the sort of an extra cost. And so when I looked at how grossmargin evolved sequentially, excluding these 3 moving parts, I felt like your auto gross margincould have been up like a couple of points sequentially. So I wanted to check with you if thatestimate would make sense. And then I will have a follow-up on energy storage.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOSequential market improvement -- margin improvement?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes.Zachary J. Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. So the 3 things that you mentioned, I had a little bit of a hard time hearing the full questionhere because we're having a bit of network difficulty in the room. I'll do my best here. So when welook at margin, we do exclude credit, as you have, so I agree with that. Model Y ramping, bringingdown overall gross margin, I agree with that as well. So it was lower than the overall average, andthat will increase with time. And shutdown and efficiencies in both Shanghai and in Fremont alsoweighed on margin, and the Shanghai margin was below the average as well. Even though it'sincreasing quickly and approaching Model 3, it still is below the average.And so I think the sentiment of your question was if you were to remove those factors, was there asequential increase in gross margin. I haven't specifically calculated that, but I think your intuition isright. We saw strength in gross margin across the board, as I mentioned. And in particular, S and Xgross margins continued to improve despite slightly lower volumes there and higher fixed costamortization.So there's good progress happening, both from the ASP side and the cost reduction side, for ourproducts and production.",

Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differmaterially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filingswith the SEC. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectHi, thank you for joining. First of all, I'd like to say, we're incredibly proud of the Tesla team for producing7,000 Model 3, Model S and Model X vehicles in the last week of June. Those were amazing efforts. Sohonored to work with such great team to fuse that incredible result. It's like mind-blowing. We continuedto achieve 5,000 Model 3s per week, 7,000 combined S, X and 3, multiple weeks in July, showing thatwe're able to do this on a sustained basis. And we expect to, in the absence of a force majeure or somevery unexpected events, be able to achieve an average of 5,000 Model 3s or above for Q3, and 2,000Model 3, Model S, X or above per week for Q3 as well. So essentially, 7,000 cars a week, plus for -- onaverage for Q3. So it's an amazing jump from only a year ago when we're producing 2,000 vehicles aweek.

So Model 3 market share is now a majority. July was a majority of all premiumsedans. That trend is, we think, likely to continue. So it's not -- we do not think it will stop there. I haveRobin Ren here, who's our worldwide Head of Sales, to talk about some of the interesting elements thatwe're seeing in terms of cars that people are trading in, the sales and demand trends. It's looking really,really positive.We're also getting great feedback from Model 3 from our customers, and we're now delivering theperformance dual-motor and all-wheel drive versions. And the Model 3 reviews are outstanding, reallycouldn't ask for better reviews from some of the toughest critics in the world. And it's -- yes, and just thething that we're recognizing is that the more Model 3s we deliver to the field, it's actually causing viralgrowth of our sales. So we deliver our Model 3 to somebody, they love it, they tell all their friends, theyare actually -- really, our customers are our primary sales force. They love their car and take their friendsfor a drive, and that's the thing that fundamentally drives our sales. 5But not everyone has Model 3, obviously, so we need to get the cars out there for test drives. As it is rightnow, not even all stores in North America have Model 3 for test drives. Of course, we prioritize gettingcars to customers, but we're soon going to have Model 3s available for test drives in all stores, and boththe performance version and the rear-wheel drive version. So a lot of people who will not buy a car untilthey test drive it, just not unreasonable. Although on Sunday, when I delivered it, testing out like directdelivery, which I think is definitely the future, direct delivery from factory to customer's home or work orwherever they are. The guy here who bought it have never actually even sat in a Model 3. I'm like, wow,okay, Mr. Raul, how do you feel about the car now? You haven't even driven it. He's like, \"I love it. It'samazing.\" So yes, it seems to be really well-received.Yes, so I'd approximate 7,000 cars a week.",

What we've found, as we spent a lot of time debugginga wide range manufacturer issues, is that the potential for our existing lines to be able to produce farmore cars is much greater than expected. That by simplifying production lines, by speeding them up, by,in some cases, having things being done manually instead of automatic, and in other cases having bedone automatic instead of manual, we've been able to achieve dramatic improvements to the output ofexisting lines, which means that our CapEx growing from 5,000 cars a week to 10,000 cars a week is atiny fraction. CapEx going 5,000 to 10,000 is a tiny fraction to CapEx needing to grow from 0 to 5,000Model 3s. This is, I think, very good news for capital efficiency of the company. And [indiscernible] that'sgoing to inform future mass market vehicles that we produce.So -- and from an operating plan standpoint, from Q3 onwards, we're going to emphasize, our goal isto be profitable and cash flow positive for every quarter going forward. Now obviously, if there's a bigrecession or there's a severe force majeure event that interrupts the supply chain, that's not alwayspossible. But we're confident that -- and provided the economy is roughly where it is today, reasonablygood and there's not a big force majeure event that we -- I feel comfortable achieving the GAAP incomepositive and cash flow positive quarter every quarter from here on out. It's -- I'll just say, there may beoccasional quarters where we'll pay back a big loan or something where there may be -- just because wepaid back a big loan. But absent that, we'd be cash flow positive.So once again, I thank the team for their incredible work and our customers for their support.

We had the benefit of having the insight into seeing what Tesla's neural networks looked likeback then, and having projections to what they would look like into the future and we're able to leverageall of that knowledge and are willing to totally commit to that style of computing to produce the designthat's dramatically more efficient and has dramatically more performance than what you can buy today.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, thanks. Yes, I mean, essentially, the key is to be able to run the neural net at a fundamental -- ata bare metal level so that you're -- in the circuits, especially when you're the calculations in the circuitsitself and not in some sort of emulation mode, which is how a GPU or CPU would operate. So you want todo basically a mass amount of localized matrix calculations with the memory right there. So it's a hugenumber of very simple complications with the memory needed to straight adjust those complications rightnext to the circuits that are doing the matrix calculations. And the net effect is an order of magnitudeimprovement in the frames per second. Our current hardware, which I'm a big fan of NVIDIA, they'regreat stuff, but using a GPU, primarily, it's an emulation mode. So -- and you also get choked on the bus.So the transfer between the GPU and the CPU ends up being one that constrains the system. So the neteffect is we're able to, with the Tesla computer, we've been in like semi-stealth mode basically for thelast 2 to 3 years on this, but I think it's probably time to let the cat out of the bag because that -- thecat's coming out of the bag anyway.

And then, more importantly, it looks like you're calling for Model 3 gross margins togo from about maybe 3% this quarter to 15% next quarter.

So just to sort of summarize, this was a major milestone for us in Q2that the gross margin in Model 3 turned slightly positive. And we feel really good about the path ahead.And as Elon said, it's driven predominantly by manufacturing cost efficiencies. It's the labor hours that weuse to produce each car becomes less, the initial ramp up costs that we have that are one-time as thoseinefficiencies disappear. Our fixed cost that are there, that gets leveraged to a higher volume. So all ofthat.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectActually, a thing that can also happen is that if it turns out that, say, a production part was either designedwrong or built wrong or something wrong with it, then on a kind of emergency basis, we have to go with 10low-volume tooling, which can be produced quickly. But a power producer of a low-volume tooling caneasily be 10x more than a product produced off of production tooling. And so just wanted -- you can have-- and sometimes, it's -- it gets really nutty [indiscernible].

And Q3 also benefits with somewhat improved mix as we're going to sell more all-wheeldrive and performance cars.

And another thing I want to point out is that we are absolutely -- since we opened theconfigurator to the general public in early July, we are seeing an increased demand coming from peoplewho do not currently hold a reservation. I think that's something that we found super exciting becausethese are the people who actually had no idea about Model 3 and they heard about Model 3 as available toorder.

I think it's probably closer to-- this is just a guess, but probably closer to $2 billion. And unless we be at a higher -- and that wouldbe sort of the 250,000 vehicle per year rate. And so I think we could be a lot more efficient with CapEx.And that would include at least battery module and pack production, body shop, paint shop and generalassembly. [indiscernible] but that's about the right number for that. And sub production is something westill need to figure out with respect to the Shanghai factory.

I was really, really impressed with the Model 3 afterowning a Model S, and so I'm really impressed how much you've developed since the early days. My firstquestion was about conquest sales actually. Right before the call, we published an article that Camry saleswere down 22% year-over-year, Prius sales were down 23% year-over-year, and we're very curious howmuch you're pulling from these other cars, other segments. It sounds like you've sort of answered thatquestion at the beginning, but can you give anything in terms of what percentage those top 5 are in termsof trade-in sales and how broad you're pulling? I know you pull from pickup trucks, from sports cars. Canyou speak a little more about the diversity you're pulling from?Elon R.

I'm not sure what the allocationis between top 5 or where it goes beyond top 5. We're just sort of [indiscernible] ask for the top 5breakdown. And it's just interesting that a few are trading up into a Tesla, so they're willing to spendmore money on a Tesla than their current car just based on the trade-in values.

But of course, we're going to do the Model Y and compact SUV. We're going to do pickup truck,the Semi, the next-generation Roadster.

Mr. Viecha, you may begin.Martin ViechaSenior Director for Investor RelationsThank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2018 Q&A Webcast.I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and a number of other executives. Our Q3results were announced at about 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter we published at the same linkas this webcast.During our call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differmaterially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filingswith the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectThanks, Martin. So I'll make some opening remarks, and then we're going to talk about vehicle safety,Autopilot and factory safety. And we have a number of people from Tesla here to elaborate on that. So Ithink there's just a lot going on that you would find interesting.But I want to start by thanking all of our customers, employees and shareholders. This was an incrediblyhistoric quarter for Tesla. Model 3 production stabilized. We delivered a total of 84,000 vehicles globally,which is more than 80% of vehicles that we delivered in all of 2017. In fact, we delivered more cars in thisquarter than we did in all of 2016 in a single quarter.Model 3 became the best-selling car in the U.S. in terms of revenue and the third best-selling car in termsof volume. We saw higher revenues and significantly better profitability in our energy business. I mean, Ithink with solar, it may have been the best quarter ever for solar. We achieved GAAP net income of over$300 million, increased cash and equivalents by $731 million and achieved a greater than 20% grossmargin for Model 3.And moreover, we expect to again have positive net income and cash flow in Q4. And I believe ouraspiration is something that will be for all quarters going forward.",

But I think even in Q1, I think we can beapproximately flat in cash flow by end of quarter.This quarter was made possible by the incredible execution of our employees across the board, from sales,production, delivery, service, energy, engineering, finance and all of our G&A teams. Really every partof the business executed incredibly well. I want to thank everyone again for their incredibly hard work.I especially want to thank customers who helped -- it's like I've never even heard of this -- maybe thishas happened before, but I've never heard of a case where a company's customers actually cared aboutthe future of the company so much that they volunteered their time to help the company succeed. I thinkthat's amazing. Just -- you don't see that anywhere. So yes, really, chokes me up, actually. 5This quarter, we started rolling out Version 9 of our software, which is the biggest software upgrade in 3years. And Model 3 received a 5-star safety rating in every category and subcategory. I think that's thelowest probability of injury of any car that the U.S. government's ever tested.Looking ahead, we expect to produce and sell even more Model 3s in Q4 and expect that trend to continueinto Q1. And we're excited to bring Model 3 to Europe and China early next year given that the market formidsized premium sedans in those regions is even larger than in North America.I said before that we must prove that Tesla can be sustainably profitable. This quarter was an importantstep towards that, and I'm incredibly excited about what lies ahead. So this is -- yes, just so, so proud ofthe Tesla team and our customers.

And you know what, the -- we're really going to try to go the extra mile withvehicle safety, not just -- in fact, there's a series of government-mandated tests, but what somecompanies do is they game the system. So they know where the side pole impact is going to be. Theystrengthen it right in that position. At Tesla, we're like, \"Okay, what is the weakest point in the car? Let ustest it at that position.\" So the actual safety is not fully captured in the tests because we anti-game thesystem. Madan, if you...Madan GopalThank you, Elon. Just to give you a very quick background about myself. So like I said, joined Tesla 10years. I'm extremely very happy to mention I'm working with an extraordinary set of very passionate andvery hard-working individuals, and that essentially shows in our product. So that's very important for us.And also important is our principal mission statement on safety because what we want to do is safety hasbeen -- is probably the important factor for our vehicle. It's not just for electrical vehicle. Any vehicle,period. And that fundamentally differentiates us, so -- which essentially helps us to keep adding newfeatures and new safety technology. And that's very important and that shows in Model 3. Just the thingsthat we have.Also the fact that we have electric vehicle, the design and architecture uses a fundamental benefit overtraditional vehicles. And that takes care of, for example, whether you have a block of engine in the frontwhere we can work with using pretty much open architecture in the front. And the whole fact that youhave all the electrical and high voltage and motors and all of that almost below the central gravity of thevehicle, it's the lowest probability of reduced or lower risk, and that significantly benefits.Elon R. Musk 6Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. I think architecturally, we have Newton on our side. And having Isaac Newton on your side isdefinitely the way to go.Madan GopalRight, exactly. So in the latest series of tests, I would like to specifically talk about Model 3. NHTSA did aseries of tests, actually 4 tests, for 1 frontal, 2 side and 1 rollover test.

Not all the same.Madan GopalYes, exactly. So if you look at there, the tricks we came up with, which is a part of U.S. NCAP rating itself,as a lowest probability of injury, Model 3 has the lowest. And just to give you a context, there are a totalof 900-plus vehicles since 2011 which have been rated. So the fact that Model 3 is the best among all the943 to be exact. So that speaks to value.And I'm very happy to say that Model 3 has achieved -- we are not stopping right now.

And so worth noting that the safety extends to not just people in car but also pedestrians.Madan GopalCorrect.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. So not having a big engine block in the front of the car is really helpful so -- because if you -- if thecar were to hit a pedestrian, we'll get to active safety next because the best thing is actually not just to hitcar or a pedestrian. The fact that the hood can condense so far in is really helpful because it ends up beinglike a sort of -- sort of like a trampoline or like -- it has -- you just -- you don't have a rock underneaththis. That's very helpful.So it's helpful for pedestrian safety and for the safety of people in the car. And then even if you have like ahead-on collision with another car, the extended sort of crumple zone of a Tesla Model S, X or 3 is helpfulto the people in the Tesla and the people in the other car.

And with that, let's move on toAutopilot and yes, just give an update on sort of Autopilot software, AI and hardware. Yes.Stuart BowersVice President of EngineeringThat's great. This is Stuart Bowers. We will soon begin to roll out the team's most advanced Autopilotfeature ever, Navigate on Autopilot. In our last release, we launched a new set of neural networks thatcombined together, provide a view of everything happening around the car.With Navigate on Autopilot, we'll use information to understand exactly where the car is on the highwaysystem and to automatically change lanes, handle forks and take high-curvature exits to follow a navroute. Initially, it will require drivers to confirm lane changes using the turn signal before the car movesinto an adjacent lane. Future versions will allow customers to waive the confirmation requirement if theychoose to.One area that I'm personally really excited to build on with this improvement is active safety. With theadvancement in neural networks covering 360 degrees of view around our car, we can provide a level ofconstant vigilance that humans just can't. Ultimately, this should allow us to warn, even intervene, for anenormous percentage of modern accidents and to ship these improvements as software upgrades to ourexisting customers.Elon R.

Over the last quarter, we'vecompleted qualification of the silicon, qualification of the board. We started the manufacturing line andqualification of the manufacturing line. We've been validating the provisioning close in the factory. We'vebuilt test versions of Model S, X and 3 in the factory to validate all the fit and finish all the parts and allthe provisioning close. So we still have a lot of work to do, and the team's doing a great job. And we'restill on track to have it ready to go by the end of Q1.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectGreat. And that will be roughly 1,000% increase in thrust and capability compared to the currenthardware. And so it's obviously a giant improvement. Despite being about the -- it costs about the same,cost volume, and product consumption are approximately the same as the current hardware. But it's atenfold improvements in frames per second. Yes. And improved redundancy as well.But very importantly, very important to emphasize is that the only -- the thing that needs to changebetween the cars produced today and the cars that are produced in the second quarter of next yearis swapping out the Autopilot computer. And this is a simple change that takes place in half an hour inservice to upgrade the computer. And anyone will be able to upgrade their computer to full Self-Drivingcapability -- upgrade their car to full Self-Driving capability with a simple service visit.So we expect all cars with the Hardware 2 sensor suite, basically anything made in the last roughly 2years will be upgradable to full Self-Driving.Peter BannonDirector of Silicon EngineeringYes.

And anyone who's paid for the full Self-Driving optionwill just get it done for free. And anyone who still wants to order full Self-Driving at this point, it's just anoff-menu item. You can still order it, but we took it off the order -- menu just because there are -- it wasreally creating a lot of friction in the sales process and people didn't understand the difference betweenEnhanced Autopilot and full Self-Driving.So just to simplify the order process, we took that off.

And my team trainsall the neural networks that analyze the images streaming in from the all the cameras for the Autopilot.For example, these neural networks identify cars, lane lines, traffic signs and so on.The team is incredibly excited about the upcoming upgrade for the Autopilot computer, which Petebriefly talked about. This upgrade allows us to not just run the current neural networks faster. But moreimportantly, it will allow us to deploy much larger, computationally more expensive networks to the fleet.The reason this is important is that it is a common finding in the industry, and that we see this as well, isthat as you make networks bigger by adding more neurons, the accuracy of all their predictions increases 9with the added capacity. So in other words, we are currently at a place where we've trained large neuralnetworks that work very well but we are not able to deploy them to the fleet due to computationalconstraints.So all of this will change with the next iteration of the hardware, and it's a massive step improvement inthe compute capability.

We absolutely see the future as kind of -- as sort of shared electric autonomy so that you'll be ableto do ride-hailing or share your car in any way in a sort of long-term model that's some combination oflike Uber, Lyft and Airbnb. So there'll be Tesla-dedicated cars for ride-hailing, and there'll be -- and anycustomer will be able to share their car at will, just like you share your house in Airbnb.So it's a combination of those 2 models.

GalvesWolfe Research, LLCIt's really amazing to see this landmark quarter after covering the company for so long. And thanks forbringing some of your team on to the call. It's very interesting. My first question is about cell supply.There's been some noise about tight cell supply and sparks and tight labor supply. Like in the short term,could you just talk about whether demand is outpacing supply of battery cells? And kind of what's yourplan for long-term expansion, including cell supply in China?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectJ.B., do you want to take that?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerSure. I can speak to that. This is J.B. We have had a period where the supply was fairly tight for Model 3.But it did not really constrain the Model 3 production in any significant way.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, like for a week.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. Maybe for a few days. Yes, the impact was larger felt on the energy products. And that's stillsomewhat tight. But we do -- as we pointed on previous discussions, we do have third-party suppliesof energy cells. So that production can continue even independently of the Panasonic supply in sparks.So that's been very helpful. And that is expanding in future quarters. And also the Panasonic supply isexpanding. The productivity of existing lines is continuing to improve with a lot of hard work from theengineering teams and just operational stability. And we continue to bring online new production lines. Soeven just in the last several weeks, we started out by getting another self-production line with Panasonic.And through the end of the year, there's another line coming on and then one shortly after that. So there'sa steady increase in the total supply that should keep us ahead of even Model 3 growth and also should letus have a larger percentage of energy supply be sourced from Giga locally.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. We are making a pretty nutty amount of the world's lithium-ion batteries. And Martin, like, I thinkwe're at 60% or something.Martin ViechaSenior Director for Investor RelationsYes.

So can you take us through what improved, like faster and better than youhad initially anticipated in the manufacturing line and where these improvements came from?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerDeepak here. And Jerome and others, please feel free to join. Our improvements on the cost side werein every aspect of cost. So clearly, our manufacturing labor hours improved significantly. Our overallmanufacturing cost dropped almost 30% sequentially, Q2 to Q3. We produced more volume. So we hadbetter fixed cost absorption. We had far less scrap. Our yield on each of the lines across both factoriesimproved significantly. And as we look forward, we see even more opportunities. We are going throughthis phase where we are now stabilizing production and the team can now intensely focus on costoptimization. And that trend will just continue in Q4. Yes.Elon R.

MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, we're trying to provide the most affordable electric car options that we can.

Solong term, I'd like to say like we're not talking about like next quarter. So like what is global -- likelyglobal demand for Model 3. It's probably in the order of -- anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million cars a year,let's say, good global demand for Model 3.

So I've done all the analysis of all the trade-ins that we've received. And really the onlypattern that I've seen is that it's sort of all across the board, and the vast majority is non-premiumbrands. I think that is the #1 message. It's just that more than half of the trade-ins we received werepriced at below $35,000 when new. But other than that, there's no real pattern. I haven't noticed anythingworth highlighting other than it's just a lot of people upgrading their cars quite dramatically.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectThis is a huge upgrade. Yes, for most people -- well, maybe for most, but for many people, it is the mostexpensive car they've ever bought. So they're clearly demonstrating with their money, that they're willingto spend extra money to get a Tesla. So like suddenly there's a sense of like mass-market premium.Martin ViechaSenior Director for Investor RelationsAnd the price walk is way beyond the federal tax credit.

If I can just squeeze in since I couldn't ask the first one that you could answer,do you think that the third quarter is a milestone, Elon, where you think Tesla becomes sustainably self-funding and perhaps not in need of outside capital?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, that is our goal. We do not intend to raise equity or debt. At least that's our intention right now. Thatmay change in the future. But the current operating plan is to pay off our debts and not to refinance thembut to pay them off and reduce the debt load and overall leverage of the company. So -- and actually, Ialmost forgot one quite important thing. As -- and this is quite helpful. It's helpful to have these sort ofcrisis situations with logistics, for example. As I dug into the inventory -- like basically finished productinventory from factory to the customer, I was quite surprised to see how long that took and that it wasquite expensive in a lot of cases to get cars to customers. This was something I didn't fully appreciatebefore. And we really have a major initiative at Tesla to get the average time from a car exiting the factoryto receiving the check from the customer, being in the customer's hands, we have to be clear, we can onlyget the check when we give the car to the customer. So getting the car from the factory to a customer,to get that to be as short as possible. In August, the average time in North America to get a car fromthe factory to the customer was 30 days, which is embarrassingly long. By the end of the quarter, we'vereduced it to around 20 days. And our goal in Q4 -- this is a goal, not a promise. But our goal is to getthe average time of a car from the factory to a customer under 10 days. This is a giant improvement inthe capital efficiency of the company because we're making on the order of $75 million worth of productsper day -- of cars per day. So every day, it requires $75,000 -- $75 million worth of capital. So every 10days, it's $750 million.",

Butthe banks will only loan us 85% of the cost of the vehicle, which translates to about 70% of the priceof the vehicle. So -- and then we've got this loan outstanding, which effectively increases the COGS ofthe car. And it dilutes the company to the tune of 30% of one of the inventory -- of the finished goodsin transit is. So this is really like tightening that and getting that below 10 days in North America andthen also improving dramatically the time -- the transit time to Europe and Asia. It is where like havinglocal factories is actually very important for the capital efficiency of the overall system because I thinkover time, we want to get the time for a car going from a factory to a customer under 7 days worldwide.And then the terms that we have from our suppliers are, on average, just over 60 days.

        "original_text": "Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionI have one for Deepak and then a follow-up, please. Deepak, the OpEx expense management was verystrong in the quarter. I think it was down 13% sequentially, and OpEx was only up 5% year-over-yeardespite revenue growing 71%. So on that front, I mean, in hindsight, did you get too bloated and neededto get more rightsized? And looking forward, how do we think about OpEx growth versus revenue growthon kind of a more normalized basis?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. Tony, so excluding onetime items, our OpEx decreased sequentially by 5%, to just clarify that firstof all. And a lot of that was driven by the actions we took in Q2 to be more efficient with our employeeheadcount. We benefited from that in Q3. And we were really careful in terms of all of our spending. Theother piece that helped us is a lot of our Model 3 spending on expense, sort of, R&D is reducing becauseModel 3 is going into production. So Q2 to Q3, we saw a reduction there. And it just gives you the senseof the leverage of -- the operating expenses can have while our revenue was growing dramatically. So ourOpEx will increase in the future but in a far slower rate, and we will continue to be really, really carefulabout the spending. And I think there are actually more efficiencies than we can find.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWe are going to find them, absolutely.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerRight. So we'll continue down that path.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectDefinitely.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionAnd then to follow up, I was just wondering if you can help us a little bit on the -- back to the grossmargin on Model 3 and the $35,000 car. So this quarter, I impute that Model 3 ASPs were maybe $59,000.And that might suggest that gross margins on a $35,000 Model 3 might be about 0.",

And I guess the question is, where is -- where would a Model 3 -- $35,000 21Model 3 be in terms of gross margins today? And where does it need to be before you want to offer itbroadly to consumers?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. I mean, it's -- look, the problem with asking questions of that nature in detail is that it is a rapidlychanging situation. So like literally, if you would ask this in a month, it will be different. In another month,it will be different. The -- there's no question that we need to get to a point where we can sell a $35,000car and where the full accountable COGS of the car is, let's say, on the order of $30,000 or slightly lessthan $30,000.

That's what we're pushing very hard to achieve.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerExactly. And it's just a matter of time. It's -- there's a significant and material COGS reduction that comes.We have the smaller battery packs with fewer amount of cells. It's not the same cells that we have in theexisting cars. And you can see the...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectFewer cells but it's not the same...Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerIt's the same amount of service.

Elon, you mentioned in August the time to get the car from afactory to a customer was 30 days, down to 20 at the end of the quarter. Your goal is under 10 by the endof 4Q. Where do we see that flow through from a COGS perspective? Is that in automotive gross margin?Or is that in services and other at this point?Deepak Ahuja 22Chief Financial OfficerYes. It's all in automotive gross margin. All logistics costs outbound, it's all in COGS for Automotive.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectOutbound logistics. Yes, I think we'll see a reduction in inbound logistics as well as outbound logistics.Maybe a question is like, for the debt that is carried for that period of time, is that factored into COGS? Oris that not?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThe interest expense of the debt, that's in the interest expense line, okay. It's not in COGS.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectOkay. Yes. That's why I think for the definition of COGS, it should probably be important to includeanything that's directly driven by volume. Essentially, that affects the marginal cost of the vehicle. Soalthough that is not in -- officially in COGS, in my opinion, it probably should be, to take the ABL interestexpense and apply that effectively to the cost of the car.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd from a broader sense, you're looking at it as the cost of doing business, which can be volume.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. Just essentially, the cash flow for everybody increases quite dramatically. Dilution or leverage outsideof the ABL line improves dramatically. And then the de facto cost of -- the effective cost of the car alsoreduces because you do not have the interest expense. If you have interest expense over 20 days versus10 days, this is a big difference.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCUnderstood.

In terms of as the federal tax credit seems to be phased out as your sales crossover the threshold, what kind of an impact have you guys modeled into how much that might slow downpotential sales?Elon R.

We achieved record production anddeliveries, record revenue, record net income, both GAAP and non-GAAP, and record free cashflow of $1.4 billion. This is really due to the amazing execution by the Tesla team. I could not bemore proud to work with such a great group of people. Just really (expletive) performance across --throughout the world.Of course, we had our Battery Day. So we hosted -- showed our plans for how we can expand in thefuture and improve core battery technology, core cell technology at the form factor level, chemistrylevel and I think most significantly at the manufacturing technology level. There's only -- acomment I made in the past is that I think Tesla's long-term competitive strength will be primarilymanufacturing. This is counterintuitive, but I'm quite confident this will be what happens.All right. So we presented what the team has been working on for a long time with batteries. Wewanted to step back and really rethink batteries from scratch. First principles thinking, just look at itfrom fundamental physics and say what -- rather than compare to other products in the market, justsay from a physics standpoint, if you -- what's the limit of physics?

The result, we think, in a few years, will be batteries that cost half as much and where the capitalexpenditures required are 1/3 or less of what they are today. And we expect Giga Berlin will see ourfirst battery cell production line at scale.Regarding the Full Self-Driving beta release. The Autopilot team, again, just a really all-star team. Ispent a lot of time with the Autopilot team. And there's a lot of really talented people in that teamwho've worked incredibly hard to make the -- to get the beta release out. So I'd just really like tothank them for their hard work. And it's just a very smart group of people. So I think we're startingvery slow and very cautiously because the world is a complex and messy place. And so we're -- weput it out there last night, and then we'll see how it goes and then probably release it to more peoplethis weekend or early next week. And then just gradually step it up until we have, hopefully, a widerelease by the end of this year.And of course, as the system collects more data and -- it becomes more robust. So it's sort of likehow does Google as a search engine get better. It's because everyone is programming it by askingquestions all the time and clicking on particular links. So it's got this great feedback loop, and thatmakes it an extremely effective search engine. It's the same thing for autonomy. Having on theorder of 1 million cars that are providing feedback and specifically feedback on strange corner casesituations that you just can't even come up with in simulation, this is the thing that is reallyvaluable. It's not like the obvious stuff, obvious stuff you can do in simulation. But weird cornercases, only a reality can give you that. So that's -- but we're able to say, okay, we need to train thesystem on this corner case situation and look for examples so we can then try it against thoseexamples and improve some very esoteric corner cases.And it's also important to emphasize that this is a generalized neural net-based approach.",

So the car -- the system is designedsuch that even if you have no connectivity whatsoever and you're in a place that you have neverbeen to before and no Tesla has ever been there, the car should still be able to drive, just like aperson. That is the system that we are developing and aiming to release this year.Then in terms of capacity build out, we're making progress on 3 major factories. We're continuingto expand Shanghai significantly, which is going incredibly well. The Tesla China team is just, Imean, incredibly good. Super smart, work hard. It's like I'm always amazed by how much progressthe Tesla China team makes. It's beyond all reasonable expectations.And then we're under construction in Berlin and Texas -- and Austin. So we're also making goodprogress there. Yes. Good. It's overall going well. I should make a point that for Berlin and Austin,we do expect to start delivering cars from those factories next year. But because of the exponentialnature of the spool up of a manufacturing plant, especially one with new technology, it will start offvery slow at first and then become very -- upward, will become very large. Just in general,manufacturing follows the S-curve. And I think sometimes, people, if they haven't spent a lot oftime manufacturing, kind of think that once you have a factory, you can just sort of turn it on andit's at capacity. But it will typically take about 12 to 18 months to reach capacity. And that is a veryfast period of time, especially for new technology. So yes, I'd say 12 to 24 months even.So generally, what I see is the manufacturing capacity is underestimated in the beginning for quitesome time. Then it is sometimes overestimated because this is an S-curve. It goes exponential tolinear to logarithmic. And it's actually an incredibly hard thing just bringing a production plant upto volume technology.If -- because you can actually think of it like you've got, through first-order approximation, 10,000unique parts or processes, all of which operate on an S-curve and -- with a bunch of uncertainty, andyou can just slide 10,000 S-curves on an X-axis, and that's what bringing up a large automotiveplant is like.

Overall, our financial health continues to rapidly improve with Q3 beinganother great quarter on nearly all dimensions, as Elon has mentioned. On net income, we achievedour fifth sequential quarter of profitability, our best net income, and nearly double-digit operatingmargins.Two things that are important to note to set context for Q3 profitability. First, the regulatory creditsbusiness was stronger than our expectations, and we are tracking to more than double this yearcompared to last. Second, as a result in the rise of the market cap of the company, the second andthird tranche of the CEO grant vested during the quarter. Additionally, we have begun expensing 1more tranche, resulting in roughly $300 million of combined period expense.I think it's reasonable to view the quarter excluding both these items to get a true sense of the healthof the core business.On automotive gross margin, including regulatory credits, it increased materially from 18.7% to23.7%, with some of our programs achieving greater than 25% gross margin. Keep in mind thatinefficiencies related to factory shutdowns affected our margins in Q2. We continue to reduce ourmanufacturing and operational costs. We are also seeing benefits from the ongoing upward trend oflocally built and delivered cars, which has increased from under 50% at the beginning of last year toover 70% most recently, which is a core component of our cost reduction strategy.",

First, I'd like to also thank and congratulate the team on a job well done. Q3 wasa strong quarter for the Energy business, and we're poised for continued strong growth in Energystorage and solar. Megapack is going to be a large growth segment for the business, anddeployments will continue to expand rapidly as the product reaches full capacity. We have moredemand than supply through 2021, and we continue to ramp the product to match unprecedenteddemand across the globe through 2023 and beyond. Our order book is rapidly filling up through2023 in a multiple gigawatt-hour scale.Large-scale solar plus storage is now more cost-effective than traditional fossil fuel generation inmany locations across the globe. This trend will continue as we remove cost, which will furtherdisplace existing and new fossil fuel generation. This is true for stand-alone storage as well.Many customers are utilizing Autobidder to maximize returns as we optimize our hardware andsoftware with advanced real-time bidding strategies that continue to outperform the market wheredeployed. For Powerwall, we see continued strong demand for residential storage as customers seekincreased reliability and backup home generation. We have a very large backlog of Powerwallorders, and we continue to invest to increase capacity to fulfill customer orders. We're just nowcapturing the full power of customer-sited solar plus storage as customers in some jurisdictions areproviding services back to the grid when they don't need to consume energy or have backup power.This has massive potential to reduce system cost and make the grid more efficient globally.In the United States, we lowered our residential solar retrofit price to $1.49 a watt after taxincentives, which is the lowest in the industry. We're able to do this by leveraging our online vehicleordering infrastructure, which substantially reduces the soft costs associated with sales andmarketing. As a result, our fixed costs remained relatively flat as our volume and efficiencyincrease, leading to increased profitability in the retrofit business.",

The first questionfrom retail shareholders is, is Tesla planning to start 4680 cell production at Giga Berlin at the sametime as vehicle production? Can Tesla share more information on what products will use the batterycells from the pilot line in Fremont?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Drew, do you want to take that?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringSure. Yes, we will incorporate 4680 design solutions into many applications in time across bothenergy and vehicle. And we can use our pilot production facility in Fremont to support the newfactory in Berlin as it ramps.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRThank you very much. Let's go to the next question, which is question #2 from retail shareholders.Does Tesla's tabless cell design allow for significantly higher peak charging rates? Does it improvethe required taper curve?Andrew D. Baglino - Tesla, Inc. - SVP of Powertrain & Energy EngineeringYes. The fundamental limitation on charge rate in lithium-ion batteries is avoiding lithium platingon the anode. And while the tabless architecture helps avoid overheating because it's a more power-dense architecture at high continuous charge rates, it doesn't change the anode plating story. Electrodesign and anode material choice more directly determines the maximum charge rate and how toavoid that lithium plating problem.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Thank you very much. The third question from retail is, would FSD be able to be transferredto our next vehicle or pay a transfer fee? It would add a broad -- it would add to brand loyalty thesame way gaming companies and cellphone companies keep you in their ecosystem by letting youtransfer purchases to upgraded hardware.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I think we'll give it some thought.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay.

I'm Carl Peterson. I'm on the Solar Roof engineering and installation. The biggest constraintright now in Solar Roof ramp is getting enough installers on board and trained and experienced.We've made a lot of progress on this in Q3, and we're continuing to hire.",

Every major product line is a start-up. Every new -- big new plant is a start-up. And sometimes, frankly, we have to learn the lesson a few times before it sinks in.

        "original_text": "- Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we want to make our cars more affordable, and it's really important to separate outaffordability from value for money. If the car is too expensive or any given product is tooexpensive, then -- and people don't have enough money in their bank account, they simply can't buyit no matter what the value proposition is. So it is important to lower the prices in order to -- suchthat people can literally just have enough money to buy it. I do not think we lack for desire for ourproduct, but we do lack for affordability. And so we have to improve the affordability of ourproducts so they are not out of reach of people.

The second comment I'd make is, if you just look at the journeyof the company over the last 1.5 years, we have grown volumes and grown gross margins despite anumber of price reductions over that period of time, and we have cut OpEx fairly stable during thatperiod of time as well.And so the key is what Elon mentioned here. I mean we have to improve the affordability of thevehicle. We have to also continue to make progress improving the cost structure of not only COGSbut of OpEx, which we've demonstrated over the last 1.5 years, I think, quite successfully, andimprove the value of the vehicles at the same time.

Looked like you could be approachingsomething like 20 million vehicles by 2030 if you hit those goals. Could you maybe share with us alittle bit more of a midterm target, like where would you be by 2025? And maybe give us a little bitmore insight into the investment required to get there, just to put that extra $2 billion to $2.5 billionper year into context.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. I mean I think the tricky thing with trying to predict things midway through an exponential isthat if things are doubling every year or even just growing 50%, then if you shift 1 -- plus/minus 1year, it has a huge effect on the number. So -- and it sounds like, wow, you either massivelyexceeded or massively undershot. But it's -- actually, what's going on is a giant S-curve. So a wholebunch of pretty big S-curves that integrate into a gigantic S-curve. So that's why it's difficult topredict the middle. And I'm not saying for sure we'll hit 20 million vehicles. But it does seem like agood goal to have because that would mean that we're replacing 1% of the global fleet per year.And it's difficult to say that we're -- are we really changing the world if we're not switching out 1%of the global fossil fuel vehicles? I mean it's -- I'm not sure that we can make that argument unlesswe change at least 1% of the vehicles per year. So that's where the 2 -- the 20 million vehicle peryear comes from. It's like 1% of 2 billion vehicles, which is the global fleet currently. The globalfleet is growing. So probably will be a bit bigger in the future. So it's hard to say. It's like map an S-curve to a $20 million -- a 20 million vehicle target in 2030, and we will slide it around and seewhat that number looks like.

So we'redesigning and building so much more of the car than other OEMs who will largely go to thetraditional supply base and like I call it, catalog engineering. So it's not very adventurous, and itbasically ends up like older products end up looking the same because they're going to the samesuppliers.So I mean, to the degree that you inherit legacy components, you inherit the legacy limitations andcost structure. And so you kind of need to make new ingredients, new parts, and then you need --then there's no machine to make those parts. So you have to make the machine that makes the part.So Tesla is like -- we're probably -- I mean we might be, in order of magnitude, more verticallyintegrated than other car companies. And which we're not now, we certainly will be. And then wealso have to create actually our sales and service and distribution system in, I don't know, somethingin the order of 40 countries, somewhere, it will be over 100 countries. Whereas the other carcompanies do not own their sales and service and distribution. So they kind of assemble parts froma supplier base and then hand them to a dealer base. So it's just like -- it's not just -- it's likecomparing Tesla to a car company, like just comparing just really one facet or dimension of Tesla,we're like maybe 10% in common with other car companies.",

The first one for me is try to understand your business model for stationary storage, haveyour thoughts on it. I mean there are 2 broad directions for me. One is selling hardware, which is abit of a cost-plus business. And I'm just wondering if there's an opportunity where Tesla couldactually share into the savings that utilities, in particular, could be able to achieve in like gridstabilization. The information I was able to get on your business in Australia a few years agosuggest that given the savings that are achieved, your hardware could have been sold at a higherprice. I'm just wondering if you have -- can share your views on where the business probably isgoing.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Co-Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, I think you're probably right about that. I mean RJ and Zach, what do you guys think?RJ Johnson - Tesla, Inc. - Global Head of Commercial EnergyYes. I mean we're already seeing this in Australia, where we're seeing behind-the-meter aggregationthat is providing grid services back to the grid, which effectively reduces the price to the customerand reduces the prices for the grid operator.

Welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2019 Q&AWebcast.I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q3 resultswere announced at about 2 p.m. Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link asthis webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results coulddiffer materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThank you. First of all, I'd like to just thank the Tesla team for an incredible job this quarter. Theexecution was outstanding and on just about every front. So it's just an honor to work with such agreat team.Q4 -- Q3 was obviously a very strong quarter. And we had record deliveries. We're able to makegreat strides in controlling our costs. We shifted back to GAAP profitability while also generatingstrong free cash flow. And again, this would not be possible without each employee doing their partto reduce cost. Our operating cost is now at the lowest level since Model 3 production started.Regarding Gigafactory Shanghai, this month, we started trial production at Giga Shanghai in bothvehicles from body to paint to general assembly. So this is a -- I want to emphasize, this is a realfactory with a tremendous amount of equipment in it. While a lot of people see the outside shell ofthe factory, which is enormous and it was essentially underwater in January, it was just below thewater table literally, what is, I think, much more significant is that we're able to install massivestamping machines, a fully operational paint shop and a sophisticated general assembly line in thesame period of time in parallel with building the building. I'd like to thank our entire team for this extraordinary achievement.",

And Gigafactory Shanghai will become a templatefor future growth. We're planning to build Model Ys in Shanghai as well, of course, and build aGigafactory in Europe. And we hope to announce the location of that Gigafactory -- in fact, we willannounce the location of that Gigafactory before the end of this year.Regarding Model Y , we're also ahead of schedule on Model Y preparations in Fremont. And we'vemoved the launch time line from fall 2020 to summer 2020. There may be some room forimprovement there, but we're confident about summer 2020.I've actually recently driven the Model Y Release Candidate, and I think it's going to an amazingproduct and be very well received. I think it's quite likely to -- it's just my opinion, but I think it willoutsell S, X and 3 combined.Regarding Version 10 and Smart Summon, last month, we released our latest software, Version 10,which includes video streaming, games, karaoke, Spotify and a host of other new features andimprovements. Most importantly, it includes the first version of Smart Summon, which has nowbeen used 1 million times. So it's now over 1 million users of Smart Summon. And we're -- in thenext week or so, we will be releasing an improved version of Smart Summon, taking into accountall the data from those 1 million Smart Summon attempts.So this really illustrates the value of having a massive fleet because it allows us to collect thesecorner cases and learn from them and use fleet learning and become rapidly better, just as Navigateon Autopilot did on the freeway. So expect a number of improvements in Smart Summon in theweeks to come. And this really is just the beginning as we collect more data and Autopilot and FullSelf-Driving functionality gets better.I do -- while it's going to be tight, it still does appear that we will be at least in limited -- in earlyaccess release of a feature-complete Full Self-Driving future this year. So it's not for sure, but itappears to be on track for at least the early access release of a fully functional Full Self-Driving bythe end of this year.And yes, lastly, we're highly focused on decisions that really make a material difference to thecompany such as opening Gigafactories in other continents.",

But that will be something for afuture time.And then one last item is that tomorrow afternoon, we will be releasing version 3 of the Tesla SolarRoof. That's the integrated solar -- with solar panels integrated with the roof. So that's -- I think thisis a great product. Version 1 and 2, we're still sort of figuring things out.

I know manyemployees are listening right now, and I want to thank you for your passion and your hard work.We've made terrific progress, and yet again, we realized margin improvement in nearly every aspectof the business.There are 3 key points I'd like to highlight. First, we returned to profitability in Q3, aided byimproved gross profit, reduced operating expenses in the absence of negative onetime items thatweighed on our financials in the first half of the year. GAAP automotive gross margin improvedsequentially to 22.8% and over 20% excluding regulatory credits.We achieved these improvements through higher production volumes on S/X and Model 3, enablingbetter fixed cost absorption. We realized improvements in labor hours per vehicle as well as othercosts such as warehousing, logistics, delivery and import-related items. We're also makingcontinued progress reducing material costs, including commercial negotiations with suppliers.Model S and X ASPs increased even accounting for revenue deferrals related to free unlimitedsupercharging. And Model 3 ASPs declined slightly driven by mix in Asia, pricing action inEMEA.",

        "original_text": "North American ASPs held flat as mix improved, offsetting pricing action we took at thestart of the quarter, which is great to see.Note that with the release of Smart Summon in the U.S., we were able to recognize $30 million ofdeferred revenue. As we expand Smart Summon to additional markets and release new features,we'll continue to recognize additional deferred revenue.Our services and other loss reduced yet again, reflecting our focus to improve the efficiency of thisarea of the business. And we further reduced operating expenses despite increased orders, deliveriesand new programs in development.And finally, on net income -- in other income, we saw benefits from foreign exchange which, as Imentioned last quarter, we don't hedge.The second key point I want to highlight is that we demonstrated another quarter of strong free cashflows despite a significant increase in our captive leasing mix and a sequential increase in CapExspend. This has enabled year-to-date positive free cash flows for the company. Our cash balanceincreased by approximately the same amount as our free cash flows, and we exited the quarter withour highest quarter ending cash balance ever of just over $5.3 billion.Specifically, on captive leases, we received a number of questions on how these are funded. We useour leasing warehouse and ABS sales to allow for captive leases without material use of cash.What's important to note here is that our warehouse and ABS flow through financing cash flow and,as a result, leases negatively impact free cash flow. This impact was material in Q3 as the lease rateincreased substantially by 50%.In addition, CapEx spend increased driven primarily by Gigafactory Shanghai and Model Yspending. We received a number of questions on why our capital spending appears low compared toprior levels even though there are multiple new projects launching and in development. As wenoted in the shareholder letter this quarter and last quarter, this is because we've made greatprogress on improving our capital efficiency.My third and final point is around demand and growth. Our global order rate remains strong andcontinues to increase. Despite increases to production levels, our order backlog has been growing.And quarter-to-date orders are significantly higher than at this point in last quarter.In the immediate term, we're focused on increasing production of Model 3 and Model S and X asquickly as we can. The bulk of this work involves continued optimization of existing equipment.We've also made targeted adjustments to pricing to better balance supply and demand.",

And our energy storage deployment, which includes Powerwalls andPowerpacks, grew by 15% to an all-time high of 477 megawatt hours.In the last 3 months, we relaunched Tesla solar in North America by simplifying our solar offeringinto 3 sizes of small, medium and large. We're transferring pricing on the website.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorActually, if I may interject a minute, but what a lot of people don't realize is in -- like in Californiaand in a number of other states, if you buy our sort of solar subscription or solar rental, there's nomoney down and you instantly save on your utility bill and there's no long-term contract. So it'skind of a no-brainer. It's really do you want something that prints money? And if it doesn't printmoney, we'll fix it or take it back. It's kind of a no-brainer. And it sort of plays into Tesla'soverarching strategy here, which is effectively to become like a giant distributed global utility onthe energy front.Kunal Girotra - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director of Energy OperationsYes, absolutely. The subscription solar offering that you mentioned was launched in 6 states. Andlike you said, it's fixed monthly payments and no long-term contracts. And the response fromcustomers have been pretty awesome.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc.",

So the same thing that we've done inresidential, we want to expand more and more in commercial as well.So all in all, the road map for energy products from solar, Solar Roof, Powerwall to Megapack issuper exciting. And I expect Tesla Energy to become a larger part of our overall ecosystem as weleverage and integrate the same competencies from our vehicle business.

        "summary": "Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. Single-visit install is a big deal. We're taking it from where the solar industry would often be 3visits before the solar was installed and would often take quite a long time to do the installation. Butwe streamlined all of that to a point where, in many cases, it's a single visit to do everything, and it'sfast. And ordering solar is literally 1 click. Youcan order solar for your house in less than 1 minute. And then we've done the same thing in the commercial solar space. Nobody thought of puttinga simple website with order -- with prices for commercial solar. We do that now. And we've seen agood response from small businesses wanting to go solar. And by removing the complexity of long-term contracts and simplifying the terms and conditions, commercial solar sales process would typically take 6 months is now taking a couple of weeks.

        "original_text": "Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IRSo the first question from institutional investors is, what are the opportunities for Tesla to createdemand? Is word-of-mouth still sufficient? Or should we expect to see Tesla commence advertisingin the near future?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. What we're seeing is that word-of-mouth is more than enough to drive our demand in excess ofproduction. We have no plans to advertise at this time. Obviously, at some point in the future, wemay do advertising, not in the traditional sense but more to just inform people and make sure thatthey are aware of the product, but not engage in the typical trickery that is commonplace inadvertising.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The next question from institutional investors. Elon, other than robotaxis and autonomousvehicle capabilities, when you look over the next 3 years, what are you most excited about at Teslathat you believe investors don't understand or have missed?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI think there's generally a lack of understanding or appreciation for the growth of Tesla Energy, asKunal was talking about. In the long term, I expect Tesla Energy to be of the same -- roughly thesame size as Tesla's automotive sector or business.This is the most underappreciated. I think it could be bigger, but it's certainly of a similarmagnitude, Tesla solar, meaning Tesla solar plus battery stuff is -- to Tesla Energy is, I think, theleast appreciated element. And part of it is like for -- I don't know, for about 18 months, almost 2years, we had to divert a tremendous amount of resources -- well, we had to basically take resourcesfrom everywhere else in the company and apply them to the Model 3 production, fixing the Model 3production ramp and simplifying the design of Model 3.So for about 1.5 years, we unfortunately stripped Tesla Energy of engineering and other resourcesand even took the cell production lines that were meant for Powerwall and Powerpack andredirected them to the car because we didn't have enough cells. Now that we feel that Model 3production is in a good place and headed to a great place, we've restored resources to Tesla solarand storage.",

So unfortunately,that shorted pretty much the other parts of the company. But it would be difficult for me to overstatethe degree to which I think Tesla Energy is going to be a major part of Tesla's activity in the future.And, I mean, Tesla's mission from the beginning has been to accelerate the advent of sustainableenergy. That means sustainable energy generation and sustainable energy consumption in the formof vehicles, electric vehicles. And I think one of the stats we'll publish in the future along with ourvehicle production is that how much sustainable energy Tesla produced or Tesla customersproduced with our products. And I think you'll see that we're producing about the same orcomparable amounts of sustainable energy as are consumed in the car -- in our cars. Because for thelongest time, the rebuttal against electric cars are like oh, don't they use dirty power from coal?Well, no, we're solar-powered. And that's -- obviously, there are solar power companies, not justTesla. But you have to sell sustainable generation and sustainable consumption, and that's whatwe're doing, and we'll do more of it.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. Thank you. The next question from investor is related to Full Self-Driving attach rates. Giventhat self-driving regulations will evolve unevenly in different markets, would you consider sellingmodules individually, for example, Navigating on Autopilot or Summon versus current strategy ofselling the package as a whole in order to encourage adoption and getting more data?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI think we'll continue to sell it in a bundled fashion. I mean, any Tesla that you buy already hasbasic Autopilot included. So I think that really is a pretty major advantage relative to other cars.And then the next step will be Full Self-Driving with Smart Summon being kind of the beginning ofthat.And obviously, we kind of have the 2 sides of it with highway Autopilot and we've got theSummon, which is sort of low speed and talking less, that kind of thing. Now we need to -- we'reworking on solving that intermediate portion, which is traffic lights and stop signs and navigatingthrough windy roads and -- windy, narrow roads and suburban neighborhoods.",

Thank you. The next question is with respect to Model Y , what is your latest expectations forlaunch timing? Do you anticipate any Model 3 production downtime at Fremont during the launch?And how should Model Y gross margin percent look compared to Model 3 gross margin?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorWell, we've talked about the launch timing. What really matters is the timing to volume production,where volume production is some number in excess of 1,000 units per week. And we're confident ofreaching that point no later than the middle of 2020.The -- yes, so from an interference standpoint, we do not expect it to interfere. Yes. The body line isseparate. The paint line is. So basically, we do not expect it to interfere with Model 3. We do notexpect any downtime. From a margin standpoint, Zach, do you want to...Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. From a margin perspective, we're expecting ASPs for Model Y to be slightly higher than theyare for Model 3. And this is common in the industry between sedans and CUVs. The part that we'veworked very hard on is controlling the cost of Model Y . And our steady-state forecast for thatprogram puts the cost at roughly equivalent to Model 3. So there will be ramp inefficiencies at first,of course, as we launch the program. But as it stabilizes with steady-state production, we do expectthat it will be a higher-margin product.",

That's -- that is unchanged. Anythingyou want to add? I mean, our cash gross margin obviously is higher than our GAAP gross marginbecause of unrecognized revenue associated with FSD attach rates.

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorSure. DeepScale is a very tiny company. It's basically about 12 people. And it's -- they have someexpertise in increasing the efficiency of neural net for a given amount of compute, which I think ishelpful. So it remains to be seen. But the intent behind what was a very tiny acquisition, was to, Ithink, slightly accelerate FSD. That's the intent. And hopefully, that will turn out to be true. Yes.Martin Viecha - Tesla, Inc. - Senior Director for IROkay. The second question, we've already answered regarding Model Y delivery. So we'll jump tothe third question from Craig.

The next question from retail investors is, can you update us on the initial results of Tesla carinsurance? Is there a time line to expand it nationally and internationally?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, I can take that. So far, we've launched Tesla Insurance in California. I have to say that I'm quitepleased by the results so far. The take rate, as measured by quote-to-purchase conversioning arequite high by industry standards. And we expect that this will only increase as folks understand theproducts better and receive some of the known price increases coming from some of the standardcarriers that they'll come to us and look for an alternative.There's a bunch of work happening behind the scenes on improving the product, particularly thepurchase flow, to make sure it's the best product experience for our customers. And we're alsoworking very hard to get other states lined up in the States and then also to launch in some countriesinternationally. So we're not able to provide specific time lines on those changes, but we'redefinitely working as quickly as we can given how well received Tesla Insurance has been inCalifornia.Elon R.

I think it also has a secondary effect of ensuring that the third-party providers of insuranceprovide reasonable rates to our customers.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOI completely agree.

Galves - Wolfe Research, LLC - Director of Equity Research & Senior AnalystI was hoping that you could give us a little bit more color on sizing up the key factors in the autogross margin improvement from Q3 to Q2. Particularly, you mentioned some nonrecurring items inthe letter. And also, should investors be prepared for any meaningful headwinds as the China plantcomes up but isn't at full production yet?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes. I can provide a couple of comments on that. So on your final -- on your last question aboutChina headwinds, there are always ramp inefficiencies when we launch a new factory. So we don'texpect China to be any different than that. So there will be some that we experience in Q4. Theamount of that is hard to forecast given that it's a different type of factory design than we did here inFremont. We're working very hard to limit the ramp inefficiencies, but certainly, fixed costabsorption and having all of the labor ready as we ramp will have an impact on Q4.And on the margin improvement, a couple of things there for auto gross margin. As I mentioned inmy opening remarks, S and X average selling prices increased from Q2 to Q3. I mean that'simportant. As I mentioned in the last earnings call, the prior powertrain versions of S and Xprovided significant headwinds on average selling price for that product in the quarter.We've also done a bunch of work as a company to become more targeted in how we adjust pricingon our products and how we optimize that based on local supply and demand. And so I think there'sa bunch of good work from the team on that in Q3, which flowed through on our financials.And cost reduction has just remained a huge focus for us. It's hard to underestimate how much ofthat has been ingrained in the culture of the company. And Jerome and his team have doneabsolutely tremendous work there. So on every line item of our cost, whether it be manufacturing,labor, warehousing, logistics, there's just a tremendous amount of good work that happened there.Specifically on nonrecurring items, to that, I'll note one being the Smart Summon revenuerecognition.

Is it a fair assumption to say that once theShanghai Gigafactory has ramped, the Model 3s sold in China for China could be the mostprofitable car you sell, even more profitable than the average car made at Fremont right now?Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOThat one is also difficult to forecast. It's a good question. At least based on the plans that we havenow, we're expecting it to be roughly in line with where Model 3 is coming out of our Fremontfactory. There's still a bunch of work around cost optimization in the factory after we launch withramp inefficiencies, and we need to work those costs down. And then there will be work to land onwhat the right mix is within the country and where we ultimately land on the product offering. So Ithink just for now, it's safe to assume that it's roughly in line with the margins that you see comingout of the Fremont facility.George M. Dailey - Morgan Stanley, Research Division - Research AssociateGreat. And if I could just sneak in one more. So it's been over 7 years since you launched the ModelS, and many OEMs seem that they don't have the same commitment to battery electric vehicles thatyou do, and many don't even offer one right now.

I think there's -- it will be consistent with the mission of Tesla to help other car companies withelectric vehicles on the battery and powertrain fronts, also in other fronts. So it's something we'reopen to.

But within the company, wemanage the business without counting on any profit or cash flows from regulatory credit. And weview it as purely incremental, and my recommendation is that everyone should view it that way."

First, there's been a lot of activity in the industry about electricpickups lately. Just curious if you have any updates, any more insights you can share on the one thatyou're about to put out later.And then secondly, there was a comment, I think, earlier about the order book quarter to date. Canyou just clarify what was the baseline? And any insights about the geographic mix of that?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. We -- I think we've said enough about the Tesla side of the truck. We're not going to -- this isnot the right forum for us to do product launches. But I think it'll be -- will be -- I mean, myopinion, and this could be totally wrong, it could be totally out to lunch here, but I think the Teslaside of truck is our best product ever. That's my opinion. Yes. The demand is not -- it seems to bestrong. So we should be production-constrained this quarter.Zachary Kirkhorn - Tesla, Inc. - CFOYes, that's right. The baseline from the comment earlier that I made was looking at this point in thequarter in Q2. And order rates are strong, I would say, in all markets. I think we're very encouragedas a team at the reception of our products. As more and more people become aware of electricvehicles, I think competitive products help raise that awareness, and overall interest is justincreasing.So our focus internally is to increase production as fast as we can, both with the existing equipmentand accelerating our timelines on new capacity. We believe that everybody should be driving anelectric car. So we need to move as quickly as we can.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes, absolutely. But we want to get the Tesla volume to where it is, perhaps somewhere on the orderof 1% -- replacing 1% of the global fleet over time. That's, I think -- we think it's pretty big, butthat's -- we think that's a good one to aim for, which is about 20 million vehicles a year, just by theway.But I do think that the demand for new cars will rise as the world transitions away from combustionengine vehicles.",

You wouldn't buy -- you wouldn't really buy a new CRT TVunless it was broke. But when flat screens came out, there was a big step-change in demand becausenow getting a big flat screen TV was much better than having a small CRT TV .And I think we'll see the same thing with electric vehicles, which is that the -- it's not just people arejust buying a car just because their last car wore out. They'll buy an electric car because it's afundamentally better car, and especially if it's got self-driving.",

Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorIt's muffled, but we'll try.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOkay. Sorry for that. So I was wondering how your thinking has evolved on Model S and Model X.It looks like the deliveries have stayed to the levels of the previous quarter and that Model 3 hasindeed cannibalized this demand for these cars quite a big deal. So how are you thinking aboutthese 2 models going forward? What's the strategy you have in mind? And then I have a quickfollow-up on the Model Y .Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThe Models S and X are really niche -- they're really niche products. I mean they're very expensive,made in low volume. To be totally frank, we'll keep -- we're continuing to make them more forsentimental reasons than anything else. They're really of minor importance to the future.Pierre C. Ferragu - New Street Research LLP - Global Team Head of Technology InfrastructureOkay. That makes sense. And then my question...Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorThey're a great car. Model S, I think, is by -- if you want to -- I mean Model S literally won MotorTrend's best car ever in history, by the way. I think if you're out there and you're buying -- andyou're sedan-buying and you don't buy a Model S, I think you've just made a mistake, to be totallyfrank. It's incredible, especially the new one with variable damping, suspension, hospital operatingroom, HEPA filter for air purification, the Raven powertrain. It's the fastest car in the world. And it'sjust it's so easy to drive. It makes you feel like Superman driving that car. It's incredibly safe. It'sjust an amazing vehicle.And then Model S, I think, it's like the FabergÃ© egg of cars -- I mean Model X. Model X is likethe FabergÃ© egg of cars.",

You're targeting 3,000 units a week. But we sawwith Fremont that the ramp on Model 3 was lumpy. And you'd sort of ramp and then you sort of cutproduction to fix the bottlenecks. Given that this is a brand-new capacity, how smooth should weexpect production to be on a week-to-week basis? Meaning once you hit the 3,000, is that 3,000 youcould go every single week in a quarter? Or is it still going to be lumpy within a quarter?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorI mean if you've got a crystal ball, we'd love to use it.Dan Meir Levy - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystI'm looking for it.Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc. - Founder, CEO & DirectorYes. It should be smoother than Model 3 because there's a lot of commonality of parts. But -- and Ithink if you look over a reasonable enough time frame, the production will actually be fairlysmooth. But from a week-to-week standpoint, it obviously will not be. It will be about as smooth as,say, the stock market. I mean how smooth is the stock market from one week to the next? It's -- butif you just extend the time period to, say, 2 or 3 quarters, it will be a very rapid steady ramp. Andobviously, it will go way past 3,000 a week.Dan Meir Levy - CrÃ©dit Suisse AG - Research Division - Director & Senior Equity ResearchAnalystOkay. Great. And then just a follow-up. You mentioned -- Elon, you mentioned earlier in yourcomments that one of the things you're optimistic on in the future is Tesla Energy. And I think weunderstand the part that one of the challenges in the past was sort of a reallocation of resourcesaway from energy to the auto side. Could you just talk to where you see the greatest pockets ofgrowth in energy? Is it solar or storage? And now that you have to -- now that you can reallocateresources, what would that entail in terms of capacity growth? Or what does reallocation ofresources look like?Elon R. Musk - Tesla, Inc.",
