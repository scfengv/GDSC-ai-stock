        "paragraph": "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for your patience. You've joined Tesla Motors, Inc. FourthQuarter 2015 Financial Results Q&A Conference Call. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Jeffrey Evanson. Sir, you may begin.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsThank you, Latiff, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015Q&A Webcast. I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Tesla Chairman and CEO; J.B. Straubel, our CTO; CFO,Jason Wheeler; and Jon McNeill, President of Global Sales, Service and Delivery.Our Q4 results are announced in the update letter at the same link as this webcast. As usual, this letterincludes GAAP and non-GAAP financial information and reconciliations between the 2.During our call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These arebased on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially dueto a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent Form 10-Q filed withthe SEC.We're going to start today's call with some comments by Elon and then Jason, and then we'll go into theQ&A session. And with that, I'll turn it over to you, Elon.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectThank you. So I think the newsletter probably speaks for itself, but I'll add some commentary on some ofthe lead points.So obviously, we had a huge increase in Model S deliveries year-on-year in Q4 last year, going up 76%.We had a huge change in our core operational cash flow, which you can really see in the chart, and it'sreally quite dramatic. That's why I think it's interesting to look at in chart form. It goes from negative tosignificantly positive in Q4 last year. And then we made modest improvements in Model S gross margin,getting to about 25% excluding onetime items, and we feel pretty good about where we're tracking toprobably get close to 30% by the -- by about Q4 this year.And then something I'm personally quite excited about is that we expect to be positive cash flow startingnext month and then continue on into Q2 and beyond. And that's -- there's only one caveat there that'sincluding the asset-backed line, and the asset-backed line is -- that's just funding for cars that are enroute to customers. So particularly as sales to international markets increases, there's more finishedgoods inventory on its way to customers. And so inclusive of the asset-backed line, which really I think is-- was accurately regarded as a slight decrease in the gross margin of the car by about roughly 0.1% orthereabouts. Apart from that, we're positive cash flow.And then we're expecting to be profitable for 2016 on a non-GAAP basis. And I personally think that, thatis actually the correct way to think -- to look at it because of the way that GAAP treats lease accounting.And -- but then nonetheless, despite the lease accounting stuff, we anticipate being profitable by GAAPstandards in Q4 of this year.And then we're really looking forward to the -- building the Model 3 on -- at the end of next month. I thinkthis is going to be really well received and then getting into production and delivery at the end of nextyear.Touching on a few things that are in the bulk of the newsletter. I think the chart on vehicle demandis really interesting. And to the degree that this represents a microcosm of how Tesla vehicles will bereceived in other vehicle segments, it augurs extremely well for the future. So the Model S was the best-selling premium sedan in the United States last year of any kind. And our sales actually increased by51%, whereas everybody else's sales declined and the overall market segment declined by about 1%. SoI think this is -- it's really rare to see situations like this. And I think this is despite us being really quiteunderpenetrated in the Northeast. I think there's a lot of room for growth in the Northeast particularly inthe U.S. and in international markets in general.So -- but essentially, getting to a 25% market share of all premium sedans in the U.S. is, I think, a greatachievement of the Tesla team. And I think it's also great for the world because it means that's 25,000fewer gas guzzlers that are on the road. I'd like to thank all the customers that went out and bought thatcar because I think they're making a difference for the environment. And of course, they're helping payfor the future development of the Model 3, which is the more affordable mass-market car. That's wherewe put all of the revenue we receive from the Model S and X. So it's really important to bear that in mind,that S and X are what pay for the Model 3.And that's -- and one additional note is that Tesla does not advertise. We don't pay for any endorsements.We do not discount our cars for anyone, including me. I pay full retail price. Whereas those actions are --all of our competitors take those actions. So that's, I think, quite interesting. We also have far fewer salesoutlets than our competitors. Essentially, there's a lot of degrees of freedom that we are not exercisingthat we could, in theory, exercise.I think -- oh, and if you look at the text, it's worth noting that this is not just uniquely true in the UnitedStates. But in Switzerland, we outsold -- the Model S outsold the Mercedes S-Class, the BMW 7 Series,Porsche Panamera and the Audi 8 combined and also outsold the Mercedes E-Class. And in Germany, weoutsold the Porsche Panamera. So I think these are pretty good situations. I mean, this is even in placesthat have no incentives. Obviously, incentives are certainly helpful. They're a catalyst for sales. They're --so Tesla always appreciates the incentives, and I think they make a difference in accelerating the adventof electric vehicles. But sometimes incentives are characterized as it's sort of all about incentives or not atall about incentives. And it's really important to appreciate that incentives are an accelerant. But that's thereality of them.Jason, do you want to add anything?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure, absolutely. Thanks, Elon. First of all, I look forward to working with everybody. I'm super excited tobe here, as excited as I was on the first day I walked through the door.Just 3 quick things I want to touch on real quick. Number one, gross margin, lots of moving parts thisquarter. And let me walk you guys through it a little bit. We had over $67 million in Model X ramp-up costsand nonrecurring items in the quarter, as Elon mentioned. Correcting for these items, automotive grossmargin, excluding ZEV credits, would have been 25%.First thing, the major component here is labor and overhead and depreciation related to the Model Xlaunch. The way for you all to think about this is towards end of Q3 and into Q4, we had to bring theworkforce into the factory to build these wonderful vehicles. Also, as soon as start-up production starts,the clock starts hitting on depreciation as well. So that's what's going on there. We also had some assetimpairments, one with our old paint shop. And we've now got a state-of-the-art paint shop in place, whichis going to give us the capacity that we need all the way through Model 3...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, that's 10,000 cars a week too.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, 10,000 cars a week. So this is a good story, and these are assets that we had purchased all -- go allthe way back to the NUMMI days. So we got every bit of life out of those assets as we possibly could.The other big piece here is we had an E&O write-off, excess and obsolescence. This is a result of betterproduction control and inventory management systems that we put in place. The place is moving reallyfast, and we took some time, Elon talked about this in Q2 on the earnings call during the shutdown,putting better systems in place to track this. We're moving to a place where we're tracking E&O on a real-time basis and bringing those facts to the table when we're making decisions. So we shouldn't be in thisposition again.Next thing I wanted to talk about just real quickly was cash flow. And Elon covered this, and I thinkthe chart on the face of the shareholder letter really gets there. But we were within striking distance ofpositive operating cash flows there. And when you add back the leasing proceeds that we get of $209million, it's a great step change in the right direction to getting us to net cash flow positive.Also CapEx, we guided to $500 million last quarter on the call, and we closed out at $411 million for thequarter. That all resulted in ending cash balance being at $1.2 billion, which I think showcases our strongimprovement in cash management and discipline with the company.Finally and really quickly, talk about capital structure. We closed the warehouse line that we previouslyhad before and opened the ABL, as Elon mentioned. Think of this as a shift to lower-cost financing. We'vegot a better deal on this line. So I think it's a better way to think about that. Intended uses, one, we'llcontinue to monetize our direct leases as we did with the warehouse line. But it also creates an option forus to finance our ramp in FGI as the Model X hits full production scale.I'll just close by saying my mandate from Elon is clear: Cash is king. And there's some real steps thatwe're taking as a company to get ourselves to net cash flow positive for the year...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectAnd profitability.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerAnd profitability. One more, it's just capital efficiency in CapEx. CapEx in 2016, as we said in the past,will be less than it was in 2015. We started to see some of this in Q4. It will continue. We're also gettingto a point where we have operating leverage in the business. We'll continue to aggressively manage ourgrowth in expenses. And then finally, and I walk around and I'm on this every day, is a relentless focus onautomotive unit cost reductions.So that's my mandate. Again, I'm happy to be here. And Elon, if you've got nothing else, we go to Q&A.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. Actually, I guess one other point that's sort of interesting to note is that Tesla is approximatelydoubling its cumulative sales every year. So this is -- I'm not sure if this has happened in the car industryfor maybe a century. But like we started the beginning of last year with 50,000 cars en route, then weended with 100,000. This year, we're maybe 60% to 80%. So if we're at the high end of that range, weagain sort of potentially double the size of the fleet. And I just think that's pretty exciting and unusual.So thank you. We'll go to Q&A.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsAll right. Latiff, let's take the first question, please."

    {
        "paragraph": "Our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionWelcome, Jason. Just want to ask a couple of questions revolving around the cash flow. I'm sure thatpeople will go into some of the X ramp and delivery numbers. First, you produced about 14,000. Youdelivered 17,000 vehicles. That would imply 3,443 reduction in new finished goods, at least the Sinventory, which could generate $250 million. Yet your inventory is roughly flat quarter-over-quarter.What's -- what, before we get the K and the Q, are the puts and takes there?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerI think you touched on it. We managed to do a really nice job of selling inventory cars at the end of theyear.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionBut on the balance sheet, the inventory number -- and cash and inventory stayed about the same.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSo there's a couple of things going on in there. So one is the finished goods but also -- doing a nice job onthe finished goods inventory but also just the ramp-up of the parts that we need to get full production withModel X.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. So it's sort of the work in process on the X. Second, can you kind of just refresh -- can you kind ofupdate us given the change from the revolver to the ABL? What is currently drawn on the ABL? What'sthe available borrowing base? How much of that is, as you think about next year, going to be used tosupport increased on-balance sheet leasing versus increases in finished goods inventory? And what's yourremaining, if the banks were to come in kind of borrowing base that would be left unpledged?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure. So on where we closed Q4 at, I think we were $135 million fully drawn on it. And then in termsof the borrowing base, there's a lot of detailed numbers behind that. I think the most important thing topoint out here is the increase to $1 billion that we did with our banking partners. And then there are somerestrictions there, and we don't want to max that out. So we're going to monitor it carefully and just makesure we do the things to do. We don't want to live on this drug.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, and I mean, we have a collection of lenders. So it's like if hypothetically one lender were to get --were to decide not to split the ABL, then would distribute it. So it's not a single currency. And we foundthat the appetite with lenders is very strong for the ABL because it's a finished product that's going toa known customer. So it's not -- there's no -- sort of there's no channel to stuff because there isn't achannel. So it's just up in transit to customers, primarily overseas.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes. It grows with the inventory balance...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerAgainst cars that have orders placed against them.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionBut it sounds like you could draw -- even if inventory, finished goods inventory, was flat, you could -- couldyou still draw on it? Or does it have to track to a direct increase in finished goods inventory?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. Yes, it does track to finished goods inventory. Basically, it's a finished goods loan."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer.Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionSo you're coming to, in the next couple quarters, to the end of some of the initial leases on the Model Ss.Can you talk a little bit about your preparations for that and your expectations as we move throughout thisyear on what will happen with those cars and how many of them are actually going to get returned?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectSure. Jon, do you want to talk about that?Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales and ServiceSure. So we actually started on that early and launched the campaign in the second half of 2015 to reachout to folks who had cars coming off lease. And one of the attractive things to those folks who werecoming off a lease is have a car that's equipped with Autopilot. And Autopilot is certainly one of the corestories of what's going on here at Tesla. It's really exciting. And so we're finding that folks are willing toupgrade their Tesla as part of this campaign. And so we've got this formal program where we're reallyproviding a smooth transition period for these cars. In addition to that, we're finding there's a very healthyaftermarket for these cars. And the trade-in values, or the trading values in the market are significantlyabove our residual reserves on the cars, which is giving us some flexibility in terms of our financingpartners offering very attractive monthly payments and loan terms because the cars are holding -- theTeslas are holding value at a much higher rate than we thought. So I think the short answer is we're outahead of it, and we're getting really good reception and conversion from customers. We're excited abouteven next generation of Tesla, which is an Autopilot-equipped car.Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionOkay, great. And then just the follow-up. There's some pretty significant legislation update in the ToxicSubstances Control Act that passed through the Congress in December. As you guys look at a lot of thedetails in terms of ramp in the Gigafactory, can you talk a little bit about where you're seeing as theimpact so far with the updated substances and how they might be treated as we go forward here?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerThis is J.B. I can jump in there. We haven't seen any immediate impacts from those results or changes.The materials we're using at the Gigafactory are not particularly toxic substances. They're...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. The Gigafactory have 0 toxic output.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, it's -- so in terms of large industrial factories, it's an incredibly clean one. In terms -- there's really noemission -- no air emissions and the raw materials are largely base metals and things like that."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionTwo quick ones. First, can you confirm reports that Jim Keller, kind of a legend in the microprocessorworld, has joined the company to head hardware engineering at Tesla Autopilot? And if that's correct, doesthat signal that Tesla might be moving to design some of their own silicone?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, I mean, I think it's public knowledge that Jim Keller has joined. I mean we have a lot of talentedpeople that join Tesla all the time. I mean Jim is an indicator of that, and just some will get a bit morepress than others. But it's -- I think the talent level that's joining Tesla is really incredible. It's -- withregards to the latter part of your question, we just -- no comment, yes.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionOkay. And then just a follow-up. On test drives, outside of company-sponsored events, kind of surprisedwe haven't seen any full comprehensive independent test drives in the major magazines. Is there anythingkind of preventing -- and I think people on the call can understand if there would be of the earlierproduced units that maybe you wouldn't want released quite yet. But is there anything preventing themagazines from gaining access to the early vehicles, the Model Xs, conducting a full road test of thevehicle? And if there is, when can we expect kind of some of the first reviews do you think?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, we -- I mean, I guess we've not provided cars to the media because -- largely because we -- tothe degree that we could suppress demand for the X, we did. So we took basically every action we couldto suppress demand for the X because production wasn't -- we needed to get production up. There wasno point in amplifying demand if the production cannot meet that demand. So we did our best to reallysuppress demand or certainly not encourage demand. That will obviously change in the balance of thisyear as we get cars to stores because there have been no Model Xs at the stores, no Model Xs availablefor test drives. And -- but I mean, in the coming months, I think probably next month, you'll start seeingsuch things, some reviews in magazines and whatnot. The feedback from customers we've gotten hasbeen very positive."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA.Emmanuel RosnerCLSA Limited, Research DivisionI wanted to ask you first, can you give us a little more color on what exactly happened with the Q4launch? I mean, in the letter, you sort of like implied that it sort of like took maybe a little bit longer thanexpected. So what sort of, like, issues have you encountered? And what have you learned that sort oflike gives you confidence that in your next launch, maybe the Model 3, you can actually ramp that upsignificantly quicker?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I think that's a great question. I think the statement we made with the Model X, which I really thinkwe've taken to heart at Tesla, is that we put too many new features and technologies, too many greatthings all at once into a product. In retrospect, it would have been a better decision to do fewer thingswith the first version of Model X and then roll in the capabilities and features and new technologies overtime in subsequent years. So I do think that there were some hubris there with the X. So the net result,however, is that I think the Model X is an amazing car. I honestly think it's probably the best. I mean, Ithink it's the best car ever. I'm not sure anyone's going to make a car like this again. I'm not sure Teslawould make a car like this again. So yes, I mean, I'd be surprised if -- if somebody buys the X, andparticularly as the software gets refined, if it's not the product they love more than any product they'veever bought, I would be surprised.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. I mean, maybe it's worth also just commenting that even some of the most innovative features on Xthat caused some challenges in Q4 have really been largely overcome today.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, that's true.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerThe operation of the falcon door, the sourcing and supply of the large glass windscreen, I mean, thesethings are working very well and are not a bottleneck at this point.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectExactly. But some of the things that cause those issues are somewhat counterintuitive. They're not theobvious things. I mean, for at least a few weeks, I mean, maybe 3 or 4 weeks actually, the constraint wasthe chrome finish on the bright work around the window, the front window, okay. And you think like howon earth could that be the constraint, but it was...Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerOr seals.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectOr seals, yes. The seals are -- yes, the seals have been really huge bane [ph]. Essentially, the seals hadto be redesigned. And then the seals that we did have had to be worked by hand in order to sort of fitcorrectly. Yes, seals are a bane. We had a lot of issues with obviously secondary seat. We've now in-sourced that capability. Yes, we really don't see any fundamental issues.Emmanuel RosnerCLSA Limited, Research DivisionOkay. So it sounds like it's basically mostly behind you. So as we move forward into the year, so you'retalking about this Model X production rate of 1,000 vehicles a week in Q2, is that an exit rate? Or is thatan average for Q2? And can you just more generally give us how you see the overall mix for the year of Sversus X play out in terms of deliveries?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI mean some of the stuff is there. You have as good a crystal ball as we do. But the -- let's see, the --1,000 a week would probably be a peak production week in Q2. So like average, I don't know what theaverage is going to be exactly, but maybe 700 or 800, something like that. So that's good for that. I thinkwe feel confident of hitting 1,000 a week certainly towards the mid to end of Q2. And then for the exactmix, I mean, I think we need to see how customers react when both cars are in the showrooms, and thenwe'll adjust accordingly. But we expect the combined delivery number average over the year of 1,600 to1,800 per week."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionCan you just kind of walk through what are the key short-term drivers? Because you're still -- of cash, I'msorry -- kind of still burning $200 million this quarter. Is it just really all volume to get back to get cashflow positive by Q2? You also touched on CapEx. Do you have it -- you're saying it's going to be flat todown, but there's -- it seems like there's an awful lot of work going on in the company. I mean, how doyou keep CapEx down as you have all these growth plans?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure. So the key drivers on cash flow positive. So as I said in my earlier comments, it's a great stepin that operations, the business is selling cars and energy products is now producing enough cash for us tostart to pay for our investments. And if you look at the Q4 dynamics, that cash flow from core operations,as we're calling it, produced 40% to 45% of the cash that we needed for the CapEx in the quarter. Sothat is certainly a big piece of it, too. Another piece of it, as I mentioned, is just going to be operatingleverage. We need to be very diligent about how we grow operating costs, certainly. And then the otherbig element to it is certainly continuing to drive cost downs on the vehicles, and there's lots of ways to dothat. We're getting better at our manufacturing processes. We're reducing scrap. We're reducing excessand obsolescence. As we talk about in the letter, the car continues to be more and more reliable. So thatreduces our warranty, and that actually has a cash impact when the cars show up less at the servicecenters.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. In fact, can I -- I'd just like to reemphasize that. We are seeing dramatic improvements in reliabilityand reductions in servicing needs. This is important. Sorry, go on.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, yes. No, absolutely. And then the other piece, you talked about CapEx and how can it be down. Well,we made a bulk of the investments that we need for Model X in 2015. So in '16, we're going to continue toinvest, but we'll really, towards the back half of the year, start to see some initial investment in Model 3.We'll continue to invest in the Gigafactory to get to where we want to be with production there. And thenwe'll continue to expand the service center, the retail locations and the Supercharger network as well. Butthere's a lot of the big pieces that we needed to spend in CapEx to get to where we are today were spentin the past, yes.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. And I think it's just important to bear in mind that the overall market for SUVs and sedans is roughlythe same. So there are -- globally, it's split almost 50-50. And so the X is kind of like half of our volume.And so if you set a company up to produce X and -- let me use -- not use the variable X. If you set acompany up to produce a certain amount of revenue and then it produces maybe just over half thatamount of revenue but has the cost base associated with it, but then obviously, the -- things will not bepretty from a cash flow and profitability standpoint. Necessarily, this is going to be true. But then as the Xproduction rises, then that changes, then we achieve the target revenue with the reasonable cost bases,and the whole picture changes dramatically for profitability and cash flow.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerAbsolutely. And the only other last thing I would add, too, is we've had a significant run-up investmentover the last couple of years. Now it's time to absorb that and look for just greater capital efficiency.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionGot it. And just one final question. Sorry, just one final question. Can you just remind us if we're -- areyou still on track for storage of 400 million to 500 million this year and 2 to 5 next year? Or is that ontrack?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI mean, J.B., do you want comment on that? I mean, it's -- I mean, one thing I can say with respect toenergy, like we do see this being a very enormous market. But we're -- it's an exponential growth market.So exactly where the calendar falls on the S-curve exponential makes quite a big difference on revenue.So it will be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. J.B., do you want to add anything?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, that's exactly right. I mean, it's not a linear extrapolation throughout this year at all. So I thinkwe're being fairly cautious in trying to make sure that we don't overpromise here and understand what'sgoing to happen in Q4. It's a little bit tricky to know how that will grow. Production is on track. We feelreally good about that. Production started off as planned in the Gigafactory in Q4. Deliveries are on track,and we're starting shipments of Powerwalls and Powerpacks worldwide. And we're growing out the salesoperations, and the sales teams are on their work. So from an execution point of view, I think we feelreally good with where we're at. It's just it's early days to predict how exactly that exponential growth isgoing to really integrate."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionI wanted to build just on Emmanuel's question. Can you just tell us, what is the current run rate of Xproduction, where we stand today towards the middle of February? And can we talk a little bit about howyou get to that ramp? I mean, it sounds like 1,000 is the target that would obviously mathematically getyou to think about half your production. So that's pretty much full ramp, but it seems like that's a prettybig distance from where you are now. And maybe we can walk through the pieces that gets you there interms of training employees, getting the supply base in order, getting some of the quality issues resolved.That would be my first question.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI mean, I don't think we want to comment with that level of granularity but -- because unless peopleactually understand how production works, they will reach incorrect conclusions. I mean, we want to stickto what our projections are and leave it at that.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay. I guess just in terms of another ramp-oriented question, if I may. It does seem that given theforecast that you have for, I think, 16,000 deliveries this year, getting to...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectThis quarter.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionAssuming 80 -- for this quarter, excuse me, getting to 80,000 to 90,000 would imply a run rate that'sabout 40% higher than where you are in Q1. But you also made a comment that inventories may -- thata lot of that is going to be international and there may be some in-process inventory being built out toservice that. So maybe we can talk a little bit about that ramp.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, the international stuff is mostly Q2. So that's really when the international ramp starts. There's stillinventory in process for, of course, North America because it takes longer to get a car to the East Coast,particularly for like a blizzard or something. But -- so that's, to me, a factor in finished goods. But finishedgoods necessarily ramps as we fill the pipeline for overseas sales, which is next quarter."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Dan Galves of Credit Suisse.Daniel GalvesCrdit Suisse AG, Research DivisionFirst one has to do with operating expenses. Hopefully, I'm not getting the numbers wrong, but it seemslike 20% growth in 2016 versus 2015 implies like relatively flat versus the Q4 run rate. Is that achievableto essentially keep the operating expenses pretty consistent throughout 2016?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, certainly. This is Jason. Yes, we definitely believe that we can do that. There was a bit of a dog'sbreakfast in Q4. We had some things in there. I'll just give you a couple of examples. So we had someaged receivables from some service revenues in Europe that we ended up having to write off. That wasone thing. We had some R&D tooling that had come to the end of its useful life that we had to write off aswell. So there's some noise in the Q4 number, for sure, but I'm very confident in the projection and theforecast that we've given for 2016 relative to 2015.Daniel GalvesCrdit Suisse AG, Research DivisionOkay, great. Yes, yes, no problem. And one other, if I could. There's been a lot of negative chatter aboutGigafactory related to signing up of other partners, precursor partners, supply agreements for accessto raw materials and just kind of the general size of the plant. I was wondering if you could give us anupdate on kind of where you stand and if you see any challenges to get up to the 35 gigawatt hours of cellproduction by 2020, 50 of packs.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerSure. I mean, generally, relative to the initial forecast and time lines, we feel pretty comfortable on wherewe're at. I think there has been a lot of drama and a lot of negativity in the reporting on this, and somearound the headcount recently that I think a lot of people picked up on. And maybe just to talk about thatone in particular, that recent sort of hiring headcount discussion cued off of numbers that we reported thatwere effective essentially in the middle of 2015. And then those were essentially compared against wherewe had predicted to be at the end of 2015. So they weren't really even really apples to apples. In ourvery -- most recent reports that we made with the Governor's Office of Economic Development, we hadreported, I think, around 272 net hires for the year at the end of 2015 against what -- we had a target of300. So I mean, the general plan is, I guess, getting actually quite closely to what we had laid out back in2014. I think because it's a fast growth, we have to be really careful at what snapshot in time you actuallylook at and what you compare that against. But we still have the same confidence. We're still on track toproduce 15 gigawatt hours of cells and -- I'm sorry, 35 gigawatt hours of cells and 50 gigawatt hours ofpacks, 15 of that going to Tesla Energy, the rest going to Model 3 and vehicles. That still is on track, andwe're on track to start cell production at the -- toward the end of this year.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectBasically, I think as to the best of our knowledge, you should not worry about the Gigafactory as aconstraint for Model 3. That is -- does not appear to be anywhere near the critical path for Model 3. So --and if I can just sort of maybe say a few words about the Gigafactory and like Nevada and the incentivesand all that. One of the most bothersome things that I see in the media is sort of overrepresentationof the Nevada incentives. The thing to bear in mind for the $1.3 billion in incentives for Nevada is thatin order for us to achieve that, we have to develop about $100 billion in revenue from the Gigafactory.And those incentives occur over 20 years, representing approximately a 1% discount on the cost of theGigafactory. The reason it's a big number, and I should say it does proportion -- it is a big number in theabsolute terms, but it is disproportionately small relative to incentives, let's say, Boeing would receive forkeeping an aircraft factory in Washington. The reason it's this big is because the Gigafactory will be thelargest footprint building in the world when it is done. Our Tesla Fremont factory is currently #2. And ifyou're curious, #1 is a flower auction house in the Netherlands. And you can look this up on Wikipedia.So it sort of makes sense that if something is kind of like the biggest thing on earth, it's probably going tohave incentives that are maybe big in the absolute but small in relative terms. And the fundamental driverof the decision that -- not the exclusive driver but the primary driver of the decision was pace of executionfor the Gigafactory. That was the primary reason for Nevada over other options. And that -- I believe thatthis decision is bearing fruit because we are seeing it move at a very good pace.Daniel GalvesCrdit Suisse AG, Research DivisionWelcome, Jason. Sorry.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerAll of those incentives are also performance-based.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, exactly.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerWe don't receive them unless we execute along the path toward the milestones.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectRight, and even some of those we do receive have clawback provision.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerExactly.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI mean, essentially, like I wrote a blog about this, there is no way for Nevada to lose. The way that Nevadaset up the incentive structure is it is a no-lose proposition for them. So they did an awesome job on behalfof the state. I mean you can read the blog that I wrote called The House Always Wins, which is true, andso -- anyway, it's really annoying to see this stuff misrepresented in the press."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionJust a first question. I mean, Elon, you made a very interesting comment about the Model X being thebest car ever produced. And it sounds like you think it might be better than the Model S. I mean, as youget...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectMaybe I'm biased, obviously.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionWell, yes, I mean, it's your newest car, so it makes sense -- your newest vehicle, I should say, so itmakes sense. But I mean, as you look at getting that production ramped up and availability out thereto consumers, what would the selling point be on the Model S then? I mean, could you get this mixsignificantly above 50% crossovers or Model X because the price premium is really not that great? Whywouldn't you sell a whole lot more Model X than Model S? And could you?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I think this is a question of owner preference. I mean, I personally still prefer to drive the ModelS over the X because I'm kind of a -- I like the lower position of a sedan. And the S, in terms ofperformance, is about 10% better in an acceleration or handling or whatnot than the X. So it reallydepends on optimization. If you like sort of a high seating position, like an amazing amount of roomand functionality and just sort of the feeling of high visibility like -- I mean, because the -- one of thebest features, maybe the best feature, of the X is the cockpit-style front windshield, which gives you thisamazing panoramic view as you're driving. And so like if -- which, like, a lot of people like that in an SUV,and so that's the reason that they buy that. So I think it really depends on personal preference. And we'llsee what the results are once we actually put the vehicle in the stores and people take test drives.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionAnd when you think about all the content that you're putting in the X and the upgradability of the S andthe X over time, I mean, how do you think about planned obsolescence, which is sort of a real necessarypart of almost any business to generate incremental sales from your existing customer base?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI guess I -- I mean, our view of planned -- we don't plan to obsolete things. We just relentlessly makethings better. So for example, for the S, there's an average of 20 improvements per week. Most of theseare little tiny nuance things that most people wouldn't notice, but it is a continuous improvement process.That's why I say when people say, well, when should they buy Model S, like what model year, it's likewe don't really have model years. We keep improving the car. If you want to wait until the car stopsimproving, you'll be waiting forever.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionOkay. And then just one follow-up just on the cash flow for 2016. Obviously, a lot of progress has beenmade more recently. As we think about the positive net cash flow and the increase in the cash balance ona year-over-year basis, will that include -- I'm just trying to be clear -- the potential draw on the ABL overtime as that's needed to run the business? Or does that net cash increase not include whatever draw thathappens on the ABL in 2016?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerThat includes the draw on the ABL to finance finished goods."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Jamie Albertine of Stifel.James Joseph AlbertineStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research DivisionOn the Model 3, if I may, just I think a lot of folks are trying to do work as it relates on the margintrajectory over time. And it's clearly going to be volume dependent and sort of timing around the launch.But I was wondering if you could help us understand. Just given that it's 1/3 of the transaction price ofroughly your initial Model X deliveries, what are some of the efficiencies you're hoping that you can sortof draw upon maybe beyond just sort of the battery reduction -- battery cost reductions? What are youleveraging in the Model 3 from investments you've already made and sort of the knowledge you havearound sort of initial launch costs and the higher-price vehicles at this point?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I think the way to think of the cost difference is really that the Model 3, being a sedan, is about 20%lighter than -- and actually quite a bit less complex to manufacture than the Model S. The Model S wasreally the first car we ever made ourselves. So it was -- we were designing to make it work as opposedto designing it from ease of manufacturing, whereas the 3 is really designed for ease of manufacturing.And then we expect, through economies of scale and just general design improvements, to get another30% improvement. So that's where the 50% improvement comes relative to the S. So sort of 35k versus70k of 3 versus S is the way to think about the difference. And our default plan, as we've done in the past,is that the initial sales are relatively highly optioned versions of the car because, obviously, we've got topay back the investment of all the tooling and everything. So that sort of makes sense to have the higher-optioned versions first. So that's what we did with the S and obviously, again with the X. While it was sortof unfortunate that -- of the way the X pricing got reported that they reported the sort of fully optionedsignature series as though it was the base price volume number in some publications. So this was justa misunderstanding of how things work. I mean, it's -- and I think it's also normal procedures in manyother industries like for -- if Intel comes out with a new CPU or faster CPU or NVIDIA comes out with anew graphics card, the -- in the beginning, it's a lot more expensive. And then over time, the price drops.James Joseph AlbertineStifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research DivisionJust a clarification, Elon, on the economies of scale. It's sort of -- should I think about that and sort of the-- running through the paint shop as an example, given you said 10,000 unit per week sort of goal there?And then separately, what could we expect -- or when should we expect to start hearing about the Model3 production line? Where do you, within the facility, plan to build it, at what point? Is it sort of going to bethe same lead time as we saw with the Model X?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, but I mean, there will be a production ramp for the 3. It's always been tricky in the past to predictthose production ramps, but yes, yes. You guys want to add?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerI think in the development plan that we have now, we have substantially more time and placeholdersput into the schedule to really refine the product ahead of the production ramp. I mean, to a questionthat came earlier, I think that's something we've really taken to heart in the launch of the X as we lookto higher volumes and what we hope will be a steeper ramp with Model 3. I think we've learned someimportant lessons on how to do that well, and having a really robust pilot build in the plant and enforcingrigorous numbers there."

I'm curiouswhat you think your minimum cash needs are. And is that something you can share with the investmentcommunity? And then just more broadly, what total amount of cash or gross liquidity do you prefer to runthe business with?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure.

And then just last question. On the Gigafactory, you've already given some updates. Butmaybe you could just talk about how much of the planned CapEx of 2016 relates to the Gigafactory.

Certainly, Gigafactory towards the end of the year, we'll start to see some Model3 investment.

They continue to be an excellent partner in the project.

If we back out the 16,000 for Q1, it looks like about 23,000 per quarter for Q3 -- or Q2 through Q4,which it seems like you should be there with production given the Model X expectations and the Model Sproduction expectations as well.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectLike I say, I know you'd love to have sort of more granularity, but it's difficult for us to give you granularitythat we ourselves don't have.

Andthen what markets do you expect to move into next with which [indiscernible] and how that ramp will go?Elon R.

So that's -- it would be -- it's difficult to say what's going to happen with Chinain the short term except that it doesn't really have a big effect on Tesla. Yes, I mean, long term, it wouldbe.

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionYou commented earlier, Elon, on the Model S versus the Model X demand being personal preferenceon passenger car versus SUV. And I was just wondering if you have any thoughts on whether ModelS demand would or could be affected once the Model 3 is revealed. Do you think that those vehiclesultimately go to different customers? Or is there a plan to avoid cannibalization there?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I mean, I think there's -- that they are different market segments, much as, say, the BMW 7 Seriesand 5 Series are -- and 6 are different -- they're different market segments from the 3 Series. And youshould think of the Model 3 as sort of sort of -- for really competing in kind of the BMW 3 Series or AudiA4 market, and so if you want the sort of ultimate machine, you'd really want to get the Model S. But theModel 3 will be a great car.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. Maybe also just as an anecdote, there was a lot of concern when we launched the X aboutcannibalization of Model S demand. And we actually saw just the opposite, which was the increasedinterest and awareness and just customer engagement actually drove higher Model S sales even as theX was launched. So -- and those are actually much closer in terms of vehicle capability as we just talkedabout.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionYes, yes, it makes sense. And I was hoping just on the financial side, can you give us just a little bit of asense of how challenging it would be -- it will be to get to that 25% Model X gross margin? And can youcomment at all on how you're expecting for the overall company gross margins would look this year? Areyou expecting them to be able to stay above 25% even with the Model X ramping?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. So as we said in the letter, 25% by the end of the year for Model X -- sorry, I'm a little under theweather -- and 30% for the Model S. So you can do the math on what the blended rate will look like. Interms of getting to 25% for Model X, we have to think about it as we've got many years of history withthe Model S right now. And that is learning that can certainly be applied to what we're doing with Model X.So we're comfortable that we're going to be able to drive gross margin in the right direction with Model Xsignificantly throughout the year.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. And I mean, in the long run, we expect the gross margins of S and X to converge around the 30%number. So they should, in the long run, both be around 30%. That's our target. It's just -- as Jason wassaying, because the X is the newer vehicle, we're just earlier on the learning curve for the X than the S.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. It sounds looks like it's not -- you're benefiting from some learning curves. So the margins, eveninitially, could be, okay, north of the 20% range. Is that a reasonable expectation, then kind of ramping upto that level? Or is it a more challenging kind of ramp?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI mean, I really look at it like where does it end up as opposed to where does it -- what happens in thevery near term. And it's hard for us to predict exactly where it is in the near term. Like just think of thatsort of S-curve and say like, where are you on the S-curve. And if you have a rapidly changing slope ona curve, it's really hard to say, \"Okay, let's pick a date,\" because you can move that date by a week andhave a huge difference. But that's why it's hard for us to give you an exact number. But we kind of knowwhere the S-curve will end up and as it starts to asymptote, then it gets much more predictable."

So when it was a GM -- sorry, we can hear your keys quite loudly. The -- when it's -- when it was aToyota GM plant, it produced almost 500,000 cars a year.

WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. So I think the general theme is two-pronged. We're densifying in markets where we already exist.And where demand has increased significantly, we've got to put service centers. And we try to actuallypredict ahead of that where we're going to need those. But as Elon referenced, we are opening newmarkets this year. But I think, in general, we're going deeper in markets where we are.

So I mean, if there's sortof something interesting and artistic or just like you -- it's entertaining, it's like wouldn't waste people'stime if they saw it. And also, I think we need to have a more affordable, high-volume car, before thatmakes sense, like the Model 3, so that it's more accessible.
