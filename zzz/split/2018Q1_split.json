        "paragraph": "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Tesla Q1 2018 Financial Results and Q&A andWebcast Call.  As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director of InvestorRelations. Sir, you may begin.Martin ViechaThank you, Sherri, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2018 Q&A Webcast.I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Deepak Ahuja and Doug Field.Our Q1 results were announced at about 1 p.m. Pacific Time in the update letter we published at the samelink as this webcast.During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. Thesecomments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differmaterially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filingswith the SEC. Before jumping into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectI think our letter says most of it, but I think we're going to spend extra time on Q&A, try to answer asmany questions as possible. I think we should really answer -- so we're going to go as long as there aregood questions to answer.The thing I'm most excited about is the rapid increase in output. We got -- just in the last 24 hours atGigafactory managed to achieve a sustained rate of over 3,000 packs per day -- sorry, per week, andactually reached the peak hour with -- if extrapolated outward would be a rate of around 5,000 cars perweek. And obviously, you can't take a peak hour and assume every peak is -- every hour is as good asthe peak. But it's -- if you can -- if you're going to achieve it even once in an hour, then with continuedrefinement of the system and improved operational uptime of the machinery, it means that you canachieve that sustained rate with more refinement. So if we spend essentially a month or 2 improving theoperational uptime and the system as a whole, we'll be able to do well over 5,000, I think.I mean, what's interesting is that, at least in the case of pack production, we were able to do this withminimal CapEx. And I think, in general, our understanding of production is improving dramatically --exponentially, in fact, and we are seeing ways to achieve improved volume with dramatically less CapExby simplifying the production line, by really engaging with our associates, no matter how junior, andimproving the way that parts are made. It's amazing how everybody's got good ideas. Just need tosolicit those ideas and implement them and then making ongoing design improvements so that when wediscover that something is not well designed for manufacturing, that we will very quickly change that partdesign and introduce that into the flow.One of the things we also found is that there are some things that are very well suited to manualoperation and some things that are very well suited to automated operation, and the 2 should not beconfused. So I should be clear that the vast majority of the Tesla production system is automated.However, as I mentioned in a tweet a few months ago, we did go too far in the automation front andautomated some pretty silly things. One example would be we have this -- so this is sort of ironicallyfoolish. We had these fiberglass mats on the top of the battery pack, but basically like -- they're basicallyfluff. So we tried to automate the placement and bonding of fluff to the top of the battery pack, whichis ridiculous. Like so we had fluffer bot, which was really an incredibly difficult machine to make work. 5Machines are not good at picking up pieces of fluff, okay. Human hands are way better at doing that. Andso we had a super complicated machine using a vision system to try to put a piece of fluff on the batterypack. That same -- and one of the questions asked was, \"Do we actually need that?\" So we tested a carwith and without and found that there was no change in the noise volume in the cabin, so we actually hada part that was unnecessary that was -- of course, the line kept breaking down because fluffer bot wouldfrequently just fail to pick up the fluff or put it in like a random location. So that was one of the silliestthings I found.We were also -- and this still remains to be fixed, but -- in a lot of cases, but we're overgeneralizing thedesign. So for example, the current battery pack has a port for the front-drive units, which we then puta blanking plate, a sealed blanking plate on. So essentially, we punched a hole in it and put a blankingplate at the hole and do that for all rear-drive unit cars, which is kind of crazy. We've added cost. We'veadded a manufacturing step, better failure mode, and for something that is unnecessary. So that issomething that's -- or example of some things. That's changed. So -- and then result is we've had aradical improvement in production -- battery pack production went from taking 7 hours to make a pack 3weeks ago to under [ 70 ] minutes now, so just to show that it's like really radical improvement. It's R&Dpossible.We also saw a modest improvement in Zone 4 of module production. This, I should point out, is a clearlyautomated zone, and we're able to also achieve a sustained rate of 3,000 vehicles a week. So we'reactually slightly ahead in battery module and pack production than expected. And with some work atthe Fremont vehicle plant, primarily in the general assemble -- general assembly area, I'm confident wewill very soon exceed the 3,000 mark in Fremont. So we're already there in the body shop, which is alsoalmost entirely automated, where we weld up the body. They were already capable of over 3,000 cars aweek, and the general assembly, with some improvements, which will include reductions on -- reduction-- I should say, temporary reduction in automation in a few places, then we should be able to do 3,000.So basically I'm feeling really good about the Tesla production of Model 3, and I'm very proud of the workthat the team has done. It's been an amazing amount of hard work and sacrifice by some very talentedpeople to achieve this outcome.It's worth noting the -- you see a chart in the Model 3 market share versus competitors in midsizedpremium sedans. We are almost the best-selling sedan in the United States in this category and -- as ofApril, and we will certainly be there in May, unless something really odd -- I mean, be there in May, andthen we'll really be there later this year, right. In the third quarter, it will -- I think there's a good chanceModel 3 gets maybe close to majority market share of midsized premium sedans, 40 -- 30%, 40%, seemslikely, and maybe a majority market share later this year. This is coming from a standing start against alot of established brands who have far more sales outlets than we do, so this is very encouraging.Okay. And yes, as this letter says, I'm feeling quite confident about achieving GAAP net income andpositive cash flow in Q3. This is not, I'd say, a certainty, but it does appear quite likely in my view. We aregoing to conduct sort of a reorganization restructuring of the company in the next -- this month and makesure we're well set up to achieve that goal. And in particular, the number of sort of third-party contractingcompanies that we're using has really gotten out of control, so we're going to scrub the barnacles on thatfront. It's pretty crazy. You've got barnacles on barnacles. So there's going to be a lot of barnacle removal.All right. Any concern or make any comments?Martin ViechaThank you, Elon. Sherri, let's go to the first question. 6Question and Answer"

    {
        "paragraph": "Our first question comes from Brian Johnson with Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays Bank PLC, Research DivisionYes. Want to talk a little bit about some of the -- first of all, if we talk about the -- sort of all relate to theproduction ramp. If we talk about the 5,000 per week run rate, is that assuming 7/24 ? Or at what pointdo you think you'd get to sort of 5-day, 2-shift operation?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, first of all, I think a 5-day, 2-shift operation is a ridiculous way to operate because that wouldbe a very poor use of CapEx. Nor is it the way that we have operated in -- for most of Tesla. So themodule production -- the cell module and battery pack production and powertrain production have alwaysoperated on a 24/7 basis. And the exception has been general assembly, which has operated on typically 2to 3 shifts, so about a 5- to 6-day, 20-hour shift; and paint, which has operated on kind of a 6-day basis.So I think it just makes sense to operate the whole company on the same basis, but a majority of Teslais always operated -- a majority of Tesla production has operated around 24/7 basis since we startedproduction.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. And this is J.B. I can chime in. As Elon said, it really makes great use of the CapEx and the lines, andthat's why we did it, starting way back at the beginning of S. But aligning everything to the same shiftschedule makes it so much more efficient because we don't have the seesaw of inventory, the underlyinginventory between the different shops.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectExactly. And one of the key things to improving the capital efficiency of the system is reducing work inprogress -- work in process. And if you don't have -- if the shifts are not aligned, then you have to buildup inventory in kind of a storage warehouse and then -- yes. So it's pretty foolish to actually operateon a 5-day, 2-shift in any way. But it's -- this is sort of a -- we're using the chip fab approach to capitalefficiency, so it's called [indiscernible]. I don't know where it says what. I'm not sure what it's called. Butlike this is something called...Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerUltimate workweek.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectUltimate work whatever, ultimate workweek. Yes. I think [indiscernible] people work like 3 long days andthen 4 long days ultimately, something like that.Deepak AhujaChief Financial Officer[indiscernible] crews on and just using overtime on weekends.Elon R. Musk 7Co-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, yes. Exactly.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays Bank PLC, Research DivisionRight. So it seems like...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectIt's not like one person working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. There are like 4 or 5 shifts.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays Bank PLC, Research DivisionYes. So if I just do the math, that would seem like 5,000 to get you to takt time of 2 minutes. And I goback to some of the prior conversations, I mean, that's -- my understanding is best in class is sort of 50seconds to a minute. And I thought the whole going faster than grandma walker was actually targeted atblowing past that, but sounds like you're sort of 2x the takt time of other factories.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectThe takt -- the number you're referring to is actually general -- the general assembly number.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays Bank PLC, Research DivisionVehicles per minute, yes.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, yes. It's general assembly number, not that other stuff, but...Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYou may have also not taken into account so-called OEE or the actual uptime of the line, which tends tomake the takt time a little faster than the product cycles.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectLet's say it could take us a minute then, because that would mean it's like over a 7-day, 24-hourworkweek. Like we could also just say -- actually we did our peak pack production today was 32 packs inan hour, so we're under a minute -- under 2 minutes a pack and rising from there.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. And probably the numbers go up rapidly as we go to the subassemblies that are in higher unitquantity per car.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology Officer 8So 4x per module, and then we have smaller subassemblies still that are factors of 10 or 20, even higherthan that.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. That said, I do believe that the path to manufacturing efficiency is velocity and density, and thatis absolutely what we'll be working on rather than just trying to spend billions of dollars on duplicatinga factory. If you make like -- if 2 companies are competing and one has to double its CapEx in order todouble production and the other one can, with minor CapEx, can just speed up the line by double, it's agame over.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays Bank PLC, Research DivisionGreat. But in the meantime, the lines -- then I think what you're saying, some starts, some stops to get tothe 5,000 per week?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. You can't -- like you can't have like 0 maintenance time and 0 -- like you have to do equipmentupgrades. You have to do ongoing maintenance, so you can't just have it be operating at peak rates 24/7."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionJust wanted to follow along on that line of question. So to the extent that you're adding humans incertain automated processes, can you just help us interpret the extent to which these changes affect theeconomics on Model 3? And to the extent that you've done some competitive analysis, all of these effortsin the Tesla production system, how do you stack up competitively against other OEMs in terms of laborhours per vehicle or depreciation per vehicle?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, I'll just say something -- so a few things, then I have -- Deepak can elaborate. Let's see. So thething that I've noticed is, if you have a really complicated machine like the fluff bot that I was talkingabout earlier, in order to keep it operating, you have to have a ton of maintenance engineering. So youhave like basically pretty expensive maintenance engineers that have to maintain the thing and fix it, like,basically 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. The cost of the maintenance engineer may not be incorporateddirectly into -- or fully incorporated directly into gross margin, but it's nonetheless a cost that far exceedsthe labor cost of simply placing the fluff on the battery pack, which, as I said, that was unnecessary. So Ithink to actually -- I do not see this having a much of a long-term impact in our cost. I actually see it mostlikely our cost will decrease, or we consider the cost to producing the vehicles will decrease by getting ridof production stations that are really poorly suited to robotics because of the very expensive cost of robottechnicians.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerRod, we are very CapEx efficient, or let me just start from that point. And if we look at our depreciationcost on a per-unit basis at steady run rate of 5,000 or so cars per week, we are, in my mind, well belowa lot of our -- I mean, most of our competitors, well below $2,000 per unit depreciation cost. And thenoverall, clearly there is some impact, as we have indicated in the letter, from the additional labor we've 9added, but it's temporary. And our expectation fully is a lot of this labor will come out once we stabilizeproduction and then figure out smart ways of automating where it makes sense.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. And just secondly, your comments in your letter on the advances in batteries were interesting.Could you give us some insight into how we can translate that into cost per kilowatt hour or some metricin terms of the gains that you're making?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThat's something -- I mean, every data point, Rod, that we look at internally suggests that we are best inclass, but we don't...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWe're the best, just not in class.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. We're the best. Sorry.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectBest in a class of one.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerI think directionally, Rod, it's helpful to understand the different commodities and the trends that we'repursuing in the batteries. Being on a path to reduce cobalt usage, for instance, has been somethingwe've been working on for literally several years now. And this has been extremely helpful in the overallcost per kilowatt hour, especially with recent commodity price movements. So I think we can't really bequantitative, but that, directionally, is a pretty good trend.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. We think we can get the cobalt to almost nothing."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionElon, so you repeatedly said, I think, in recent weeks that you do not need to issue equity capital at Tesla.I think many investors on this call would say it's better to raise capital when you don't need to. So I guessfirst question is...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectI disagree.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research Division 10Yes. You may not need to, but do you want to?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectNo. I specifically don't want to.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionPerfect. Okay. My follow-up, Elon, is your cars produce really a large amount of data, and SpaceX gets intothe satellite broadband business next year...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectNot next year, but it's probably 3 years.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionOkay, 3 years. Some argue that SpaceX could offer Tesla a resilient cybersecure pipe for this preciousvehicle data and a potential competitive advantage. So Elon, isn't bandwidth an obvious domain forcollaboration between Tesla and SpaceX one day?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectI mean, it might be. There's lots of interesting things we could do. Cars got a lot of computing power, andit's connected to the cell networks and WiFi and everything, or it's certainly connected to a LEO Internetconstellation. I haven't really thought about it, but probably there is."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionElon, you've talked about the downtime on the Model 3. You're going to take 2 planned periods thisquarter. One has already occurred. The other is going to occur later in the quarter. What specifically haveyou addressed in Fremont so far? And what are you planning to address a little bit later? And are those thelone kind of remaining bottlenecks for you to get to the 5k within the Fremont plant?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, the Tesla production system at this point is vast, so -- and we literally have the 2 biggest factorieson Earth between the Gigafactory and Fremont. Giga is still slightly smaller than Fremont. I think --well, maybe just -- yes, slightly smaller, but it will soon be bigger than Fremont. And Fremont is like thesecond-biggest building of any kind by footprint. So it's just like there's -- this is a vast -- the full answerto that question is a complex one. The -- I feel very confident about our ability to get to 5k very soon ina sustained rate at Giga, getting to -- essentially getting to 5,000 battery packs and motors and powerinverters and charges and that kind of thing [ installed ] down at Giga by the end of next month. Andbattery production, no problem. General assembly is probably our biggest risk, and I'm really focusing on-- personally on that a lot in the next -- in the coming month. And then the -- our paint shop is maybe thesecond-biggest risk after general assembly, but these are all pretty -- these are all quite manageable. It'snot like huge brain surgery to get these things right. It's a lot of work. I like to say it's a lot of -- just a lotof time and hard work, but it's very doable. And yes -- so it's really quite straightforward. It's not like afundamental impediment here.John Douglas Field 11Senior Vice President of Engineering (Leave of Absence)And many cases, we've seen huge gains through software that's in the car, software that controls theautomation and connects to our central system. So in many cases, it's not even hardware upgrades thatcreate substantial increases in velocity.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, exactly. Doug makes a good point here, and I think that is -- that the production -- a really greatproduction system is primarily a software problem. And there's no one in the auto industry that isremotely as good as Tesla -- at software as Tesla. We're -- I mean, Tesla is way better at software thanany other car company. So if it is -- what I'm saying is true, that the biggest challenge in the productionsystem is software, we are in a good position.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay. Maybe taking my next question in a different direction. What is your time line for launching theModel Y? And have you begun to spend for this, or that only begins to start hitting the P&L from an R&Dand a CapEx perspective in 2019?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectIt will only start to become significant in 2019.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay. So all of the CapEx spend for this year is associated with Fremont, Model 3, Gigafactory?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectNo, no. I mean, please take me literally. I said it will only start to become significant next year. It's not 0right now, but it's not a big number. It's not a big number relative to our revenue.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerIn the early days of product development anyway, there's not much CapEx. CapEx becomes greater as youcommit it to equipment and equipment starts to come in-house.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. Although it is remarkable -- although the amount of money spent in the beginning is really quite lowin the beginning of a development program, decisions made at the beginning of a development programhave massive implications for future CapEx. So it is better to spend a bit more time making the rightdesign decisions and really thinking through the producibility of a product before racing ahead with CapExdecisions. There's no question we could have made the Model 3 much easier to produce than we have.Model Y, I think Model Y is going to be a manufacturing revolution. It will be, I think, incredible from amanufacturing standpoint because we do not want to go through this pain again, yes."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura Instinet.Romit Jitendra ShahNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division 12Yes. I just wanted to clarify the gross margin comments related to Model 3 that you put in the letter. Yousaid a couple of things. You said, over the medium term, Model 3 gross margins would be below the targetof 25%. You also said that in Q3 and Q4, that those gross margins would be highly positive. So I'm justtrying to understand what's possible for Model 3 gross margins by the end of the year. Could we get to anumber that's close to 20%?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerWhat I'd say is that progressively, each quarter, we will be getting better.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThe answer is yes, and it'll come down to what other economics come into play from currencies tocommodities, and how much more cost we take out from labor. So I don't want to give you a specificnumber, but probably close to it.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectIt's like -- yes, exactly. If not -- it's -- yes, exactly, very close to 20%, could be slightly below, could beslightly above.Romit Jitendra ShahNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research DivisionOkay. Fair enough. And then, Elon, can I just ask you about...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectSorry. Just thinking of going a little further forward than, say, Q4, we're very confident of the 25% grossmargin.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerThanks for clarifying that. Yes. We feel very good about that in the medium term.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectFor next year, 25% is definitely what we would expect.Romit Jitendra ShahNomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research DivisionSo when you say medium term, you're talking 2018?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, exactly. That's why it was important to clarify what these things mean. Yes, Q4 is when we expectto be on or about 20%. Then by the middle of next year, 25% gross margin should be where we are. Andthen we'll also try to get to the high 20s by the end of next year.Romit Jitendra Shah 13Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research DivisionOkay. As a follow-up, could you just comment on Jim Keller's departure, a highly respected chief architect?What does it say, if anything, about the development of Tesla's custom silicon and Autopilot?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, Jim is a great guy. And the sort of dream he wanted to pursue for a long time to -- which is tokind of redesign how server architecture works, it's not something that I find a lot interesting, but it'ssomething that Jim -- it's been a sort of a personal dream for Jim to do, and that's why he went to Intel.The Tesla -- the actual design of the Tesla hardware is primarily led by Pete Bannon. I should be clear,like the lead designer of that is Pete Bannon, who is still with Tesla, and then of course Andrej Karpathy ishead of our AI team. So we don't plan to hire a replacement for Jim's position."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionI just wanted to follow up on the previous question and the gross margin targets. I think you had said lastquarter that once you got to 5,000 units, you felt that you could get to 25% gross margins on Model 3, sothat feels like at least a 6- or 9-month delay relative to what you thought a quarter ago. And I'm trying tounderstand what the key drivers are. Is it really the labor for capital substitution? I don't think currencysequentially has changed much. I understand it can be a headwind. But I think relative to when you madethose statements, it hasn't changed. So perhaps you can help us understand what has changed in termsof the gross margin ramp for Model 3 relative to what you thought before. And I have a follow-up, please.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, it's along the lines of what we said in the letter. If we look at the combination of the recently imposedtariffs, Section 232 and countervailing duties plus commodity price increases as well as the weaker dollar,that is adding significant material cost. And then temporarily, we are using more labor. So when youcombine those 2, that's what led to our guidance. And certainly, the material -- the labor cost piece, wewill address and that will come out.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. But I mean, we're only talking about a 3% to 5% difference. So like -- and that's something that we'llsolve like within 3 to 6 months later, so I don't -- it's not like it's some -- don't make a federal case out ofit.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionAnd then separately, what, if anything, are you taking out in terms of your lowered CapEx projection forthis year? And specifically, in spending less than $3 billion, where does that take you in terms of bothbattery and production capacity for the Model 3?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, so we're just being much more smarter in many cases. As Elon said, we are not just spending moneyon automation. We're of course looking at the problem, simplifying it, and that's helped us reduce ourCapEx on Model 3. And then we are also being critical about how we grow our infrastructure and line it upwith our growth in our business. So we feel that these are the right decisions and there is still room for 14us to reduce it further if we wish to. So we are leaving ourselves some discretion here to go spend moneywhere needed.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionAnd so where specifically will you be in terms of capital requirement?Elon R.

        "paragraph": "Our next question is from Galileo Russell with HyperChange.Galileo RussellTo represent retail investors, I was wondering with Waymo's plans to launch an autonomous taxi service inlimited markets this year if you could give us an update on the Tesla Network and any details surroundingthe launch date or geographic rollout.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectSure. So I mean, that's -- thank you for an interesting question. The launch involve -- where things areobviously going towards is a shared electric autonomy model. So the -- in order for this to -- obviouslyfor the whole sort of system to work, you need all the pieces in place. You need to have full autonomy,full 4 or 5, whatever you want to call it, and obviously a lot of cars in the road and then build the softwareinfrastructure behind that to enable shared autonomy, so to help enable people to share their cars andbe able to offer their cars as effectively kind of a robo Lyft or robo Uber. It's sort of like a combination oflike, I guess, Uber, Lyft and Airbnb type of thing, where you can own your car and have a higher percentusage of an autonomous electric car. You can say it's available generally to anyone who wants to use itwhen you're not using it. You can recall it at will. You can restrict usage to only friends and family or onlyusers who are 5-star. Like this is like the obvious thing that's going to happen. But in order for that to bein place, we have to obviously sell full autonomy, and we're making a really good progress on that front.I believe that the current production of -- the vehicles that we are currently producing are capable of fullautonomy, but the only thing that would really be, like, might be needed or maybe is probably neededis a computer upgrade to have more processing power for the vision neural net. But that's a plug-inreplacement, a thing that can be done quite easily. So I think we're really well positioned and are buildingthe right -- the foundation for a -- having millions, ultimately tens of millions of shared autonomouselectric vehicles. [indiscernible] decide not to share if you don't want to. And then...Galileo Russell 15And specifically on the timing, though, do you have any details about or when we could even expect tolearn more about the timing of this service?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, the hardest thing to predict about the timing is regulatory approval. The thing that's tricky withautonomous vehicles is that autonomy doesn't reduce the accident rate or fatality rate to 0 . It improvesit substantially. But the reality is that even though we think our -- when we think autonomy, even carautonomy reduces the probability of a death by 30%, which would be incredible because this is like, ifapplied broadly, there's over 1 million, I think, 1.2 million automotive deaths per year. And how manydo you read about? Basically none of them. However -- and but if it's an autonomous situation, you --it's headline news. And the media fails to mention that, actually, they shouldn't really be writing thestory. They should be writing a story about how autonomous cars are really safe, but that's not the storyif you want a click on, so they write inflammatory headlines that are fundamentally misleading to thereaders. It's really outrageous. So -- and this would be true like even if electric cars were -- I'm sorry, ifautonomous cars were 10x safer. So instead of 1 million deaths, you have 100,000 deaths, there's stillgoing to be people who will still sue and say, \"Hey, you're responsible for the death here.\" And it's like,well, the 90% of people who didn't die are not suing. They're not -- they're still alive. You just don't knowit, so you -- we've got to deal with that. And then obviously regulators respond to public pressure andthe press. So if the press is hounding the regulators, and the public is laboring on misapprehension thatautonomy is less safe because of that -- of misleading press, then this is where I find the things to -- thechallenge of predicting it to be very difficult. And yes, it's really incredibly irresponsible of any journalistwith integrity to write an article that would lead people to believe that Tesla -- that autonomy is less safebecause people might actually turn it off and then die. So anyway, I'm really upset by those.Galileo RussellYes. Really interesting answer.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectI can personally say, from a technical standpoint, I think we'll probably be ready by the end of next year.Galileo RussellAwesome. And then one more quick thing on production capacity and speed of the Fremont line becausethis is something you mentioned a lot, it seems. And in the last quarterly conference call, you mentionedthe max capacity with 700,000 cars for Fremont or somewhere around there. And that was S, X and 3.And so we recently got a report form Reuters saying that Model Y production would start in November2019 at Fremont. And so I'm just kind of curious, with the Semi and the Model Y launching next year, likewhere are you actually planning on assembling these vehicles?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectThe Reuters report is based on nothing, like I don't know where that came from. We will not be startingproduction on Model Y at the end of next year. I would say it's probably closer to 24 months from now. So2020 is more likely a prospect for Model Y, or early 2020. And the production location for Model Y has notbeen decided. We're really crowded here at Fremont. I don't know where we'd put the Model Y production.So it's difficult to imagine that. We just could not fit the Model Y production at Fremont. We are jammed tothe gills here. So one thing I'm sure, it's not here. It is crazy packed, and we're -- yes. And so we'll try tofigure out what the optimal location is for Model Y production, but it's not here, not here in Fremont.Galileo RussellOkay. And I'm not an expert in battery pack technology, but it seems that a lot of people are speculatingthat the specs for the Semi truck, even, I believe, the CEO of Daimler said it breaks the laws of physics.So I'm wondering is this just a linear... 16Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectHe doesn't know much about physics. I know him. I'm pretty happy you're engaged in a physics discussionwith him. I actually studied physics in college.Galileo RussellSo yes, my question is, is that just a linear improvement in your battery technology? Or is there some sortof new breakthrough or different platform that the Semi and Roadster are going to be built on?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectLike even if we didn't -- I mean, even if we didn't improve our battery technology at all, we could achievea 500-mile range truck. At all. We're going to do better than 500 miles.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. This is J.B. I think the key point is it doesn't require some dramatic breakthrough that -- so there'sa fundamental misunderstanding, I think, of what the current technology in our existing products canactually do. And maybe that's just a misunderstanding of the current status of the technology versusothers in the industry. That could be where some of that's coming from. If they're benchmarking sort ofthe best battery pack they can buy from a supplier and then mapping that with what the Semi could do,it doesn't give you -- it doesn't solve. I think that's maybe where some of this is coming from. But we -- Imean, we basically have what we need in-house and understand how to do those specs today or better, asElon said.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWe could do a 500-mile range Semi today. I think the actual production unit will be about 600-mile range.Galileo RussellAwesome, great stuff. So I'm also wondering, are you guys going to let Porsche beat you to market with a350-kilowatt hour Supercharger? Because I know you've mentioned a V3...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWe'll keep going until you ask questions that are not boring.Galileo RussellYes, I can keep going. So the 350-kilowatt charger from Porsche, like if they had mentioned they'rerolling that out, on the lab call, J.B., you seemed to indicate that you guys were sort of going to keepthe status quo with your Supercharger technology. But Elon, I know you've mentioned that there is a V3Supercharger, so I'm just trying to get some clarity on whether you will be improving your Superchargertechnology or not and if there is a V3.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, we're definitely going to be improving our Supercharger technology. The thing about a 350-kilowattcharger is it doesn't actually make a ton of sense unless you've got a monster battery pack or have like acrazy high C-rate, in which case your energy density is going to be poor. So it's kind of cockamamie. Yes,I think maybe 200 -- on a -- also I don't know if you meant 350 kilowatts for a single car. That's reallypretty -- you're going to frag the battery pack if you do that. There's no -- you cannot charge a high-energy battery pack at that rate unless it's a very high kilowatt-hour battery pack. So something along the-- yes, I think -- J.B., like a couple hundred -- 200, 250, maybe... 17Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, I mean, that -- that's definitely sort of power level that we've discussed and explored. And some ofit also comes down to an optimization around utility versus cost and trade-offs in the car itself. You kindof hinted at that, Elon, but there is a trade-off fundamentally between charge speed and essentially rangeor cost of battery. And we look at that pretty carefully. We understand the trade-off, and we could designcells in the pack that could charge it faster than 300, 400 kilowatts. But it's not a very useful trade-off tothe customer. That's...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectLet's go to understand the difference between energy and power even, really. Energy -- obviously,energy's rate is essentially, at most, a range. And then power is kind of like your peak accelerationbasically, the rate at which you consume energy. So really what -- it's more important to have long rangethan it is to have a superfast charge time. And you can sort of think about this in the devices that you use.Like would you rather have a cell phone that lasted 2 hours but had -- it could charge in 5 minutes or 10minutes, let's say, but only lasted 2 hours. Or you'd like a cell phone that lasts 2 days and maybe takes 1hour to charge."

        "paragraph": "Our next...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. I -- we'll keep going until we have quick questions on -- are still -- while they're interesting.Galileo RussellI have a couple more. For the Superchargers, I know you guys are not trying to profit off of Tesla ownerswith that infrastructure, but would you ever open that up to other automakers and try and generaterevenue from that system?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWe've always said that we're -- this is not intended to be a walled garden, and we're happy to supportother automakers and let them use our Supercharger stations. They would just need to pay the share ofthe cost proportionate to their vehicle usage. And they would need to be able to accept our charge rateor at least -- and our connector, at least have an adaptor to our connector. So this is something we'revery open to, but so far none of the other car makers have wanted to do this. But it's like not because ofopposition from us. This is not a walled garden. Trying to make a meritable share.Galileo RussellOkay. And maybe could you clarify what's the strategy? Like it seems like that would be a very strongmoat to have this, that work that you guys have been building globally for years. So why open it up, andwhy is that not a moat?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectSorry. Can you repeat the question?Galileo RussellI'm just wondering why that isn't a moat because as a long-term investor, I feel like the charginginfrastructure you guys have built would take years and millions of dollars for another brand to replicate.So I'm just curious about the strategic thinking behind opening that up versus keeping it closed. 18Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectFirst of all, I think moats are lame. I mean, they're like nice and sort of quaint in a vestigial way. But likeif your only defense against like invading armies is a moat, you will not last long. What matters is the paceof innovation. That is the fundamental determinant of competitiveness. And for any given company, ifthe rate of innovation -- let's say, like our competitors, maybe they're -- they come out with somethingnear every 6 years. We're maybe every 2 to 3 years. So if our innovation is, let's say, twice that of anygiven competitor, then it is simply -- this is true of, generally, of companies in any industry. Whichevercompany has the highest rate of innovation, unless that company is actively killed by its competitors insome way that's nefarious or shoots itself in the foot, it will, at some point, exceed those competitors. Likethis is obvious that this would occur with Amazon or Walmart, because Walmart's rate of innovation wasnegligible and Amazon's was very high. The outcome was obvious a long time ago.Galileo RussellAnd in terms of the Megacharger, I noticed you guys are going to be selling energy at a fixed price forthose truck customers. So I'm wondering what the philosophy is there. Is it also you're going offer that atcost and reduce that energy price? Or are you thinking of that as a revenue stream for the company?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWe haven't really talked about any of that and haven't finalized, frankly, any of that. It's -- we want tomake sure that there's a very seamless and easy system to operate trucks wherever they need to go. Andsome customers may elect to work with us on the whole system or parts of it. But I think there's a lot ofdifferent ways that, that can be solved.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. I mean, for sure, with commercial trucking like a heavy-duty Semi, economics are fundamentalto that situation. We're not making decisions based on aesthetics or consumer-related things. We're-- like we made our -- we're trying to make our Semi kind of cool and sexy just because we think thatthat's a good thing to do, not because it affects the buying decision of our customers in a meaningfulway. It doesn't really move the needle. I mean, there was like a laughable lawsuit recently from somecompany ironically called Nikola. It's like Nikola is suing Tesla. That's hilarious. Fate loves the irony. And-- but they're like suing us because of the way the trucks look, which is absurd. Nobody's buying a Semitruck because of the way it looks or because it's got like a wraparound windshield or whatever, please.So the economics are incredibly important. And so we have to make sure that the Superchargers orMegachargers, whatever you call them, or the trucks are set up in a way that you'd have very low cost ofelectricity.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerI mean, one maybe slightly related point to that, that I think is super exciting about this is the potential tolink up renewable energy generation at a very fixed and also very affordable cost to power future truckingfleets. Ultimately, that can give customers an incredibly deterministic cost per mile that will not changewith the price of petroleum over decades, which is really, really an interesting proposition for a truckingcustomer. And that's something that we're pretty excited about.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, exactly. It's really worth emphasizing that. For trucking companies, like if the cost of diesel goesup a few cents, it just like destroys their business. And whereas with the sort of Megacharger situation,combining -- having basically a solar battery-powered Megacharger, we have -- there are constant costsand we know what they are; we bake them in. And yes, it's very predictable and lower cost per mile than 19a diesel truck. And fundamentally, it's like what is the cost per mile kilometer of cargo? And that drives thecommercial trucking market. You can have the ugliest truck in the world and it still would be victorious.Galileo RussellYes. And building on that, do you have any thoughts on how the trucking market could change orpotentially grow if you guys are actually able to deliver on dramatic cost reduction, especially with thingslike platooning?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectI think it will take away quite a bit of revenue from railway because the reason rail's heavily competitiveis it's effectively just platooning with lots of railcars. And you need only a small crew to operate the train.However, trains don't go everywhere. So you have to like have a truck to deliver things to the train railspur and then pick stuff -- pick it up. And then at the destination, the truck's got to pick it up from the railspur over there. So you still have trucks plus train plus transfer. So I think platooning of trucks will quitedramatically affect the rail industry in a negative way.Galileo RussellOkay. Last one, I promise. On Tesla Energy, I assume that you guys are basically supply constrained, notdemand constrained on that side of the business. So I'm wondering how you're prioritizing residentialversus utility scale. And in particular, how has this successful project in South Australia sort of changed theindustry's perception of what batteries can do?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, I think it's had quite a profound effect. The -- there's -- South Australia took a chance on doingthe world's biggest battery. That's worked out really well. If you read the articles, it's worked out farbeyond their expectations because the battery's able to respond at the millisecond level, far faster thanany hydrocarbon plant. And so it's value and good stabilization is much greater actually than even a gasturbine plant, which can normally respond quite fast. So it's kind of like you get in a Tesla and you can --you have that instant acceleration. Feels like you like have -- also like a mind meld with the car. It's justlike the car is you. And then that same rapid response is true of the battery pack. So the customers that --the utilities that worked with us thus far have really loved the battery pack. And I feel confident that we'llbe able to announce a deal at the gigawatt-hour scale within a matter of months. So it's a 1,000 gigawatts-- megawatt-hours -- 1,000 megawatt-hours for [ zeroing gigawatt-hours ].Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, maybe just for the first part of your question also, it is absolutely accurate that we are still -- there'smore than enough demand. And we are still building under our demand backlog and actually increasing itslightly. And we're trying to do our best to prioritize customers between residential Powerwall and utilityand commercial. I'd say our longer-term strategy is to shift a little bit of our focus and really catch up onour Powerwall demand backlog, which is quite -- it's too long right now. We know people are waiting toolong. So that's -- I think that's generally the direction we're trying to take that. But Model 3 has taken alot of focus in the last few quarters, and that trend is going to be reversing in the second half of the year.Martin ViechaLet's go to the next question, please."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Phil LeBeau with CNBC.Phil Lebeau 20Elon, question on the Tesla Semi. Can you give us some perspective in terms of how many reservationsyou guys have now, and where you guys are in the plan for developing it and rolling out the first model?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectMy apologies, sorry. We're just discussing something internally. Could you repeat that question?Phil LebeauWith the Tesla Semi, how many reservations do you guys now have approximately? And where are youin the process as far as the development and the rollout of the first model in terms of time line when youguys expect that to happen, et cetera?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectI actually don't know how many reservations we have for the Semi. I don't think...Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAbout 2,000.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectAbout 2,000? Okay. I mean, we haven't really tried to sell the Semi. It's not like there's like an ongoingsales effort. So sales orders are -- for the Semi are like opportunistic, more like companies approachingus. It's just not something we really think about much. Our focus is on the Model 3. We need to get that toabove 5,000 a week at a good margin. We need to become a profitable company. That is a good criticismthat has been leveled at Tesla, an accurate one. It's high time we became profitable. And the truth is likeyou're not a real company until you are, frankly. So that's our focus right now. And then -- so we've gotan awesome product road map. The Tesla Semi is one of those things. And I think we've got a really goodidea for the -- the Model Y is going to be amazing. I'm really excited about that. Tesla pickup's going to begreat. So the product road map -- I mean, we have like way more cool things than we know what to do.Like the idea is -- idea generation part to devoted to execute it. So we just need to stay focused and notdivide our attention on too many products at one time.Phil LebeauAnd a follow-up. When -- given the fact that you're already packed to the gills in Fremont, when will youmake a decision regarding a second manufacturing facility?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectSo the -- that's probably later this year. It has to be later this year. So I'm not sure of the exact time, butI don't know, maybe next quarter but not later than fourth quarter for Model Y. And then we also expect toannounce the location of the Tesla Gigafactory in China soon.Phil LebeauAnd will that second factory, when you announce it, will it be in North America or is that going to be inChina?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, I just said it's in China.Phil Lebeau 21So the Gigafactory's there, but the second manufacturing plant will be in China as well?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectSorry. Oh, I mean, yes -- sorry. In the future, all Gigafactories will include vehicle production. So rightnow, we've got vehicle production and battery production -- like battery production and motor andpower electronics and charger production are at Giga and they'll be at our Fremont car factory. Butfuture Gigafactories will all incorporate vehicle production. Please add to the fact things like that -- thatwe appreciate -- we're appreciative of the fact that the government of China has announced that theywill be allowing full ownership of manufacturing facilities in China. We still have to express an order ofappreciation to the Chinese government in that regard. I should also -- Robin, is there anything that you'dlike to say or anything?Robin RenWell, we're already in good discussion with the government, so we'll announce something when we'd like.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectOkay. So Robin Ren's here with me. Robin is managing worldwide sales for Tesla right now. He was bornand raised in China. Won the physics Olympiad in his circle. Anyway -- but we'll talk more about -- I thinkthe next earnings call or next -- we'll have a lot more to say about that in the future."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from James Albertine with Consumer Edge.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCAnd if I can be brief, I wanted to ask, given the coverage that you've received as it relates to these high-profile accidents, one of the things we like most about your company is you have the most miles testedand continue to test daily from an Autopilot perspective. Can you give us any color from what you'reseeing in your data as it relates to the confidence that your consumers have in the Autopilot functionality,whether they've used it more or less frequently in their existing vehicles or whether they've opted topurchase the functionality more or less in lieu of these accidents? Because we're really trying to get aheada sense of consumer sort of -- the ability or the likelihood of consumers to adopt this technology overtime. So this would be very helpful.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWe do see a steady increase in the number of percentage of miles driven with using Autopilot. As we rollout more functionality, as we make it better, we see a steady increase. I think it's something -- for carsequipped with Autopilot, something on the order of 1/3 of highway miles, maybe closer -- maybe 1/2in some cases are -- in some regions are on Autopilot. But then, of course, when there's like negativenews in the press, then that dips. And then I was like, \"Okay, this is not good because people are readingthings in the press that cause them to use Autopilot less, and then that makes it dangerous for ourcustomers and that's not cool.\" That's why I get upset. And then we get accused of blaming the victim.I was like, \"Look, we're not blaming the victim here, but it is important that people not be under thewrong impression.\" The statistics are unequivocal that Autopilots improve safety. No question. In fact, onething I was going to mention, forgot to but also going to mention, is that we'll be publishing our safetystatistics on a quarterly basis so people know exactly what Autopilot safety is. Is it getting better? Isit getting worse? And it's like, look, coloring those impressions is that when there is a serious accidenton Autopilot, people, for some reason, think that -- or some of the articles think that it's because thedriver thought the car was fully autonomous and it wasn't, and we somehow misled them into thinkingit was fully autonomous. It is the opposite case. When there is a serious accident, it is almost always,in fact, maybe always the case that it is an experienced user. And the issue is what -- more one of 22complacency, like we get too used to it, that tends to be more of an issue. It's not a lack of understandingof what Autopilot can do. It's actually thinking they know more about Autopilot than they do, like quite asignificant understanding of it, but there's less, [ maybe less ].James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCJust to clarify, Elon, so you've got 2 accidents spaced out pretty far. You've had dips during those periodswhen the accidents occurred. But to clarify your comments, you are increasing use -- you're seeingincreasing usage and you've weathered those dips based on where we are today?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectThat is correct."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Ben Kallo with Baird.Benjamin Joseph KalloRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionSo I remember the Barron's story, I don't know if it was fake news or not, which you hung up onabout your battery cost. And I don't want to ask a mundane question, so -- but I think it's importantbecause one of your stakeholders are shareholders right now. And so far, we've had a couple pushoutsin production. And is there a way that you can update us when you get to that 3,000 number or 4,000number per week? I mean, you -- you're active on Twitter. Can you just let us know? Because -- we'regoing to have a big vacuum here and there's a lot of news flow out there that makes volatility into thestock. It makes it hard for people to own even though you have a lot of believers out there. And so eventhough it would be in my office right now, I think it's very important to get those kind of updates. And sothat's -- I think that's my question. Can you give us an update when you get to 3,000 and 4,000 per weekon the Model 3?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes. Actually, the -- what's -- Tesla's such a leaky server of information that I think the news will leakpretty quickly. Also people track registrations very closely. So at most, any information that we providewould be 1 week or 2 in advance of what will become public knowledge just due to vehicle registrationsand shipments that are tracked very carefully. So that really, the problem is like people get too focusedon like what's happening in the space of a few weeks or a few months. This is -- it's an old maxim ofinvesting, you should not be focused on short-term things. You should be focused on long-term things. Wehave no interest in satisfying the desires of day traders, like we couldn't care less. Please sell our stockand don't buy it.Benjamin Joseph KalloRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionI completely understand your frustrations, and I'm frustrated too on how myopic we are right now.They also say that great years are made out of quarters and great decades are made out of years. Soeveryone's short-term focused in some ways ,and volatility has a way of taking people out even if they arestrong and want to be there. And so anything you can to do to help in the near term on that, I think it'shelpful for the stock.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectI mean, I think that if people are concerned about volatility, they should definitely not buy our stock. I amnot here to convince you to buy our stock. Do not buy it if volatility is scary. There you go. 23Martin ViechaOkay. And let's go to our last question now."

        "paragraph": "Our last question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.Alexander Eugene PotterPiper Jaffray Companies, Research DivisionNot sure if this is going to be a hard question to answer. You mentioned Model 3 market share versusthe 3 Series and others in that segment. To what extent do you think Model 3 is, I guess, changing thedenominator, making that segment larger as a class versus what it used to be?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectI think it will probably increase the total number of sedans purchased, yes. Yes, I think so.Alexander Eugene PotterPiper Jaffray Companies, Research DivisionSo you think you're pulling ex Accord buyers and Camry buyers into that class, as example?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, we know this because of the trade-ins. So we see quite a wide range of cars [indiscernible] a lot oftrading in the cars. They're not necessarily owners of a C-Class or an Audi A4 or a 3 Series.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerWe saw signs of trade-in with Model S, so with Model 3 it's going to be even more prominent.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectYes, yes, exactly. And I think -- like also, once we get to like the shared autonomy, ride-hailing thing, we-- it could be as soon as the end of next year, but that's already technically ready. But then not long afterthat, I would expect some jurisdictions to give regulatory approval. The effective cost of ownership of aModel 3 or Tesla drops dramatically because you can share that car with others.Alexander Eugene PotterPiper Jaffray Companies, Research DivisionOkay. Very interesting. Last one. You mentioned earlier, you think the Model Y production is going to be atrue sort of production revolution. If you had to do the Model 3 over again, there are some things that youwould have changed, and you hope to incorporate those learnings into the Model Y. What specifically wouldyou do or what specifically do you plan to do?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, CEO & Product ArchitectWell, I think let's save that for another time. Like we'll talk about that when we unveil the Model Y. But it'sreally going to be dramatically better. The design and production system, I think, really will be next level.Jeffrey B.
