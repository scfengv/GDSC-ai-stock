        "paragraph": "Okay, Elon, over to you.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThank you. But first of all, I'd like to announce that our CFO, Jason Wheeler, has decided to leave Teslain April -- so it's at end of next month, to pursue opportunities in public policy. Jason will be replacedby Deepak Ahuja, who was Tesla's first CFO and worked for the company for more than 7 years beforestepping away in 2015. Deepak will formally take over as CFO in early March and with Jason remaining atTesla through April to entrust a smooth transition. And let's see, Jason, would you like to say anything?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure. First, Elon, thanks for the opportunity.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThank you.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerIt's been a great ride, and I'm really going to miss working with all the wonderful people at Tesla. This isan A team. And when I walked in the door, I was very passionate about the mission of the company. Andtoday, I'm even more passionate than I was than the day I walked in. And I think it's also important tosay that I'm looking to scratch an itch that I've have had for many, many years now. I'm going to go dosomething in the public sector, but I wouldn't have felt comfortable about leaving if we didn't have a reallygood plug-and-play solution in place for the company. And I think with Deepak's history here on the vergeof bankruptcy and everything he's gone through, he's well positioned...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIt's been [ph] a long time ago.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerLong time ago, long, long time ago. He's well positioned to take you to the next level of growth. And I'vespent a good amount of time with him in the past week, and he's super-energized and ready to go. He's agreat leader, and I think I'll leave Tesla in good hands.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderAll right. So thanks -- and Jason, thank you again for everything you've done.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerAbsolutely, my pleasure.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSo let's see. I think the -- yes.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsWell, I think we're ready for the first question.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. That's just right. Do you have any question?Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsAll right. Vicky, first question, please."

        "paragraph": "And our first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionFirst, good luck, Jason; and congrats, Deepak. Welcome back. So Elon, a question for you on Mars. Let'skick it off at Mars, okay?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderReally?Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionYes. It has Tesla relevance. So just bear with me.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI admire long-term thinking but impressive.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionWell, numerous reports have suggested the new administration may be in favor of accelerating a missionto send humans to Mars. I'm curious if you think this is accurate in spirit. And if launched, how could thispotentially change your balance of time spent between Tesla and SpaceX? Could it potentially change therationale of keeping Tesla and SpaceX as independent companies? And this is a serious question, Elon.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderOkay. Well, yes, but when you started out, I was a little curious as to how this would become relevant toTesla. But as I said before, I expect to remain with Tesla essentially forever unless somebody kicks meout. So that remains my intention. And I've been pursuing the sort of Mars thing at SpaceX and the sameenergy at Tesla for a long time simultaneously. So I think it's going through a pretty good rhythm. Andyes, I'm -- I don't think -- I certainly don't think I'm going to change my actions as a result of an initiativeby the administration although I think a Mars initiative would be amazing and really energize the publicdomestically and would apply just as the Apollo mission to the moon that was half a century ago. So that's-- yes, that's I think probably the best I -- the most I can say at the -- yes [indiscernible] yes.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionJust a follow-up on insurance. If your cars prove to be as much as 90% safer than other cars on a per milebasis, as I think you've alluded that -- it's a reasonable target medium term, and if insurance companiesonly offer your customers, say, like a piddling 5% discount versus a comparably priced car, would youconsider offering a service or product like P&C insurance directly to Tesla owners from your own platformand your own stores?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderJon, do you want to take that?Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceHey, Adam, it's Jon. We're actually currently doing that, and we've been doing it quietly. But in Asiain particular where we started this, now the majority of Tesla cars are sold with an insurance productthat is customized to Tesla. It takes into account not only these Autopilot safety features but also themaintenance cost of the car. So it's our vision in the future that we'll be able to offer a single price for thecar maintenance and insurance in a really compelling offering for the consumer, and we're currently doingthat today.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. And this is not to the exclusion of insurance providers, but I mean, if we find that the insuranceproviders are not matching the insurance proportion of the risk of the car, then if we need to, we will in-source it. But I think we'll find that insurance providers do address the insurance cost proportionate to therisk of a Tesla.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceThat's true. That's true. We're doing this with insurance partners today.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionCurious as to what has changed on your end. Obviously, you've got -- made an acquisition. You've hiredthe individual in manufacturing from last year. But really moving from the Model S and X to the Model 3ramp that you're looking for in the back half of 2017 here into 2018, how have you gone about the Model3 development differently versus the Model S and Model X that will really be able to unlock the key todriving production much higher than what your previous ramps have looked like for new products?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight, the Model 3 is designed -- is really designed for manufacturing. It's considerably a simpler carthan the S or the X. Some of these -- some modifications are obvious. For example, the Model 3 onlyhas one screen, whereas the S and X have 2 screens and 2 separate computers powering each screen.The Model 3 has 1.5 kilometers of wiring. The Model S has 3 kilometers of wiring. So we simplified thewiring system considerably. The -- a lot of the bells and whistles that are present on an S and an X are notpresent on a Model 3. So we don't have self-presenting door handles, for example, or falcon wing doors.These reduce the risk substantially in a ramp and make it just easier to scale. And so I think it's goingto be a very compelling car, but it's just -- it's a simpler design. And we also understand manufacturinga lot better than we did in the past. And we're also able to get usually the A team at the A supplier forModel 3. It's really that we're now able to get that, whereas for S and -- particularly for S and to somedegree for X -- when we trying to get suppliers for Model S, a lot of the top-tier suppliers wouldn't evenwork with us, didn't believe the car, that the -- they thought we'd go bankrupt. And the -- IHS, I thinkit's called, but they're basically a predictor for -- volume of the Model S predicted -- an official predictionof 3,000 units lifetime for the Model S. And for a lot of the big supplier, particularly the large sort ofconglomerate suppliers, they just plug that number into their predictions but they ignore what we say.And then basically, the volume is either too small to count or the car cost is enormous because these fixedcosts must be allocated over such a small volume. Now in fact, we are building something in the order of50,000 Model Ss per year. And so having shown the results of the S and the X, the interest from suppliers,you went from basically getting like the worst team on second-tier suppliers to getting the best team onfirst-tier suppliers, really a big difference.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionYes, okay. And then just following up on that as I think about reduced complexity of the vehicle,understood. From an actual line speed manufacturing perspective for the Model 3, what are you doingdifferently with the manufacturing process that is going to allow you to drive that ramp in production?So think about 50,000 units, Model S, on an annual basis, it's good. It's great. You've been making thatvehicle for the last 3, 4 years.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight, as opposed to -- I mean, for -- yes, an annualized rate of 250,000. 5x that number for Model 3 is areasonable question to ask. The -- there's just a lot more automation than there is for S and X. We havethe Gigafactory, of course. That's a huge asset for factory, powertrain, power electronics, chargers and afew other things. So that's a huge asset and yes -- so -- but also we focused most of Tesla engineering,including design engineering, into designing the factory. The -- I think in the future, the factory willbe a more important product than the car itself. I've said this before but we're -- our goal is to be thebest manufacturer on earth. This is a real goal. I don't know if we'll succeed, but I think we're makinggood progress in that direction. And that's -- yes, it's really -- when you think of the factory, it's just anenormous product with at least [indiscernible] more complex than whatever it makes. J.B., anything youwant to add?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, I might just add that we really learned a lot of lessons, especially from the difficult Model X ramp.That's something that's in our recent memory, and we fought through it and succeeded. But I think inthe design of the Model 3 and the system and the lines that produce it, many of those learnings havebeen incorporated from the beginning. So the amount of complexity in the operations to assemble the caris dramatically reduced. The amount of operations involved some level of sort of assembly craft, wherethere's more judgment of the operator. It's dramatically reduced, almost eliminated. And a lot of thesethings that we could identify directly as the bottlenecks that hurt us on the X ramp, we've been able totarget specifically and reduce or eliminate. So that has -- though painful, it was a very helpful experiencefor us to get ready for Model 3.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Now I do want to emphasize with production ramps in general that -- they call it an S curve. So therate of production is as fast as the slowest component in the vehicle. And when you have several thousandunique items, the -- it can be as fast as the least likely and worst executing part of Tesla or our suppliers,but that's just the way it goes. So it's -- you're going through a series of constraints. You try to anticipateas many as possible. There are new issues that pop up every week. And then we attack them and getthem to solve for schedule. And then another issue will pop up in the following week. So it's schedulewhack-a-mole. And if we knew what would be late now, we would obviously attack it, but some of thesethings only come to light late in the game. And when you have a global supply chain, you inherit a lot offorce majeure risk from around the world. It's just one of the things that I think we want to do is minimizeforce majeure risk. This is -- if you inherit like every force majeure risk on the earth, then of course,things are going to go wrong because earth is big. So I think we're going to, increasingly over time,rationalize our supply chain to minimize the force majeure risk. It's very important, but yes, the -- it'salways tricky being a public company and reporting on a quarterly basis. Even small differences in wherethat exponential part of the S curve is can make quite a big impact on the quarter because [indiscernible]imagine datelines moving around an exponential curve. Just small changes here and there have quite abig effect. And then things get more predictable as you get to the flat part of the S curve, the top of the Scurve. That's why it's a lot easier to predict, to say what things would be next year or the end of this yearas opposed to what they'd be month by month this year."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionJust regarding the explanation in the shareholder letter that you experienced little Autopilot revenue,little new revenue in 4Q. Can you talk about what delayed the software updates into 1Q? Was it a switchfrom Mobileye in any way? And then talk about how the current capabilities of Autopilot in 1Q in terms ofperformance and safety, how that's better than maybe what was offered previously.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, we had some challenges in the transition from Mobileye to Tesla software running on GPU. The --our original plan was to have a migration strategy where we have Mobileye and our -- and Tesla visionoperating at the same time to have some kind of a smooth process, but Mobileye did not -- refused todo that. So that forced us to reach in [ph] the board and caused unexpected delays, where we had tobasically delete that chip from the board and just [indiscernible] on Tesla vision. Safety is always ourprimary concern. So we could have released Tesla vision [indiscernible] orders there at high speed.Probably 3 months ago -- I was driving at a high speed personally 3 months ago but -- so I think we wantto just have an exhaustive testing process, a vetting [ph] process before enabling that throughout thefleet. So we've been edging our way up gradually now. Longitudinal control, [indiscernible] cruise controlis at 80 miles an hour and [indiscernible] at 50 miles an hour. And I think we should be able to get both[indiscernible] Unless testing shows something different, we should able to get them both to around the --maybe 85 miles an hour next month and be at parity with [indiscernible]. But that's -- and then obviously,things will only improve from there.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionJust last question on the $500 million cash generation outlook, including growth of nonrecourse debt, howmuch of that relates to the automotive operations versus SolarCity? Or maybe you probably don't wantto break it out that way. Just how are you thinking about the contribution from, like, tax equity fundingversus maybe, call it, combined like Tesla-SolarCity, like, ongoing operations?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure, yes. So this is Jason. So that commitment that we made when we closed the deal was on the Solarside. So that's what the $500 million really [indiscernible]. And that's going to come from a number offactors. One of the things we're already starting to see great traction on is a shift away from leasingsystems to doing loans and cash sales of systems. We provided some information in the letter about that.That's going well. We've also done that on the vehicle side. It's worth noting. And then the other thing isas part of the acquisition, we committed to $150 million in synergies. And some of that cash generation isobviously going to come from going after those synergies, and we're on track to really hit that. We've gotlots of opportunities on customer acquisition cost. Tesla has a very strong global brand. We've got a greatretail footprint. So we've got good pieces in place to really drive customer acquisition cost down. And thenobviously on the manufacturing side as well, we're really thinking through what that's going to do for usand how we can drive cost savings there as well."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets.Joseph Robert SpakRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research DivisionFirst question, I guess, relates to the delivery guidance which I know you limited to the first half. Butas we think about the full year and the back half, is the -- and the launch of the Model 3, is there thepotential for disruption to S and X? Is that also one of the factors why you're sort of -- decided to sort ofguide the way you did?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderAll right.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure. I think the way we're thinking about that is there's going to be pretty higher bars on -- withthe deliveries only for Model 3 in the second half of the year. And I think Elon described that well whenhe talked about the S curve. So we didn't want to muddy our guidance by doing some kind of a combinednumber for the year. And obviously, execution on X and S and execution on getting ready for Model 3 inthe first half is what's important. And those are the things that we really want to point investors to andhow we're measuring ourselves.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIt's sort of -- tackling the area under the curve is tricky when you're in an exponential. And it alwaysstarts out tiny and then it goes up -- well, it goes exponentially. So -- but generally, people have troublewrapping their minds around an exponential. The natural tendency is to extrapolate on a straight line. Andso the -- it's just [indiscernible] important to emphasize that this is -- this blow up is exponential. It doesget into a linear zone, and then it goes into a log curve. So...Joseph Robert SpakRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research DivisionAnd then will -- I guess just to follow on that, I was wondering if you guys would be willing to indicatewhen you think configuration for the 3 would open. But separately also, Elon, there's been a lot of newsor noise around unionization at Fremont, and I was wondering if you guys could give a little bit of color onyour views of potentially unionization. And if it did occur, sort of how that changes the cost structure?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSure. Well, there is obviously quite a strong effort by UAW to unionize Tesla. And actually, a lot of peopleat Tesla have been approached by UAW. They've expressed concerns about this. I -- and there were somenumber of claims made by someone who I think is de facto an employee of UAW but at Tesla. And there'sa piece that's probably going to be published in the next day or two, because I wanted to make sure I fullyinvestigated the claims before writing a thought piece. But that [indiscernible] matters over the last fewmonths. Tesla's injury rate is less than half of the industry average contrary to the allegations made. Andthe compensation, if you look at -- if you started 4 years ago, the vesting period for Tesla stock is 4 years.So if you said, \"What is the outcome for somebody who started 4 years ago?\" It's by far the highest inthe auto industry. The -- there was an allegation that a few are underpaid at Tesla, but in fact, they're thehighest paid in the industry if you include the equity, which obviously you should include. So the -- thereare really only disadvantages for someone to say that -- to want the UAW here. I mean, the track record isworse in every other company. I don't think this is likely to occur."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.Aileen SmithThis is Aileen Smith on for John. First in a more high-level question, I realize it's still very early days interms of the new Trump administration, but with Scott Pruitt now head of the EPA, are you anticipatingany changes with respect to the oversight or regulations under CARB and its relationship to the EPA? Elon,is that coming up in your meetings with the Trump team at all or any of the discussions? And how wouldyou respond in the event that regulations and standards or the potential to generate the credits were to bealtered?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSure. Well, it's only come up briefly. And my response is that I think it will be fine to get rid of incentivesand subsidies, but that should be uniformly applied to all industries. It would obviously be wrong to-- or to get rid of any sort of government intervention in sustainable energy while retaining it in fossilfuels. That -- if the principle is to get rid of government intervention, that should be uniformly applied,not unfairly applied. But that's the only thing -- there was no -- that was my comment, but there's noresponse given. They listened to that and that's sort of -- that's how I feel. And as I mentioned on aprior call, the reality actually is that if electric vehicle incentives went away tomorrow, Tesla's competitiveposition would improve. It's probably why GM is able to sell the Volt at the price that they are able to doit while on paper, making a loss. It's that they -- their ZEV credits are worth only twice as much as theyare for Tesla because they get the full retail value of their credits, which is worth about $10,000 more tothem than it is to Tesla. We get basically 50 cents on the dollar when we can sell ZEV credits, which isnot always. Last quarter, we were able to sell only a tiny amount of ZEV credits because that mandate isjust already really weak. So the irony of getting rid of it would actually improve our competitive position.And ZEV credits only apply to 14 states in the U.S., every 14 -- they don't apply internationally. And yes,so -- and then things like the federal tax credit for electric vehicle caps out, I think, at 300,000 cars.We're not far from that point. So the ZEV, basically the credits either don't scale to high volume or they'redisadvantageous to Tesla. Even in California, which is our home base, California legislature put an incomecap on any one who could get the California tax credit for EVs, which then excluded a whole bunch of ourcustomers, which I think is counterproductive to the biggest manufacturing player in California Why thehell the legislation? That, I do not know, but it was harmful to the state.Aileen SmithOkay, great. That's helpful. And then sort of a second question. You guys gave some helpful disclosurein terms of the vehicle order growth for the Model S and X in the quarter. Can you talk about the ordergrowth for the Model 3? The last measurement that we received on the size of the wait list or the orderbook was 400,000 plus or minus. Can you talk about how that's grown over the past few quarters? Imean, if we look at the customer deposits on your balance sheet, it actually declined sequentially from 3Qto 4Q. So how much, if any, of that is related to the Model 3?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure. So it's not related to the Model -- this is Jason. It's not related to the Model 3. We still hada number of Signature Series Model X reservations, where there was just a higher deposit required forthose cars, and we were able to deliver a number of those in Q4. So that's the primary driver behind thequarter-over-quarter decrease in the customer deposit decline.Aileen SmithOkay. And can you give any size of the order book for the Model 3 as it stands right now?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerWe're still in great shape.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. We don't put that number because people read too much into it -- yes, as Jason is saying, that isreally not our concern. But yes, we anti-sell the Model 3.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerWe don't want to make the line longer.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, good point."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionCan you -- in the press release, you gave comments on margins for the first half of the year. Any broadcolor on how we should think about margins in the second half, particularly as the Model 3 launches? Imean, will that be profitable day 1? Or is that going to take some time for that to ramp? Any color there?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderPerhaps that will not be profitable on day 1 because of that exponential issue that I mentioned. Theonly Model 3s will be like horribly negative margin, particularly on day 1, literally -- as in literally onday 1 because just on the -- at a tiny, tiny rate as you go up this giant machine. So it's just -- like nocompany on earth could -- there's no point for Tesla. It is like physically impossible. So you have toget the production rate to some reasonable capacity percentage of the system. If the capacity of theproduction system is X, until you're at least like half X, your gross margin is going to be weak. And it'sgoing to be terrible when you're like an order of magnitude below -- or if you're 10% of X, like or less, it'sgoing to be terrible. So -- but then it will get really good as you start to approach nameplate capacity. Ithink it's great, but -- and then as we get to the initial phase of capacity of 5,000 a week, I would expectto see gross margins comparable to that of the S and X.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionSo -- and that's next year that you should get to the 5,000 per week. Is that right?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, I feel pretty confident that we should get there by the end of this year to 5,000 a week. The -- nowI do want to separate this from parts orders. I know a number of our suppliers are listening. It wouldbe impossible to keep this -- I mean, like nothing is a secret these days, it seems. Yes, it's like majorintelligence organizations cannot keep a secret. It's like a really -- I mean, who can honestly? So whenwe place parts orders with our suppliers, we've told them 1,000 a week in July, 2,000 a week in Augustand 4,000 a week in September. These are parts orders and the parts need to arrive, then you can turninto a car and the car needs to be delivered to customers. None of these things occur instantaneously.So -- and we have what I call like maybe the term paper problem of, like -- I was a teaching assistant incollege. And no matter what date we set the exam paper for, when the term paper was due, it's -- there'salways like some order of people that are late. It's just the way it goes. People are sometimes -- well, andI'm guilty of this, too, like, too optimistic about the timing or they get unlucky or something like that. Sowe have to set these really strict dates. And some number of people are late, but it only has to be 1%.And then we'd either have to make those parts manually at great cost or slow down the production rateand ramp at great cost. If we make something manually as opposed to mass production, it can be 10x,20x, 30x more than a product that's made -- handmade as opposed to made with high volume productionequipment. So that's essentially -- I'm trying to give you what the problem space looks like in my head sothat you can try to model it. You know what I know. And if I knew which 1% of suppliers it was right now,I would obviously take action. But I don't because I don't know who's going to be unlucky. I don't knowwho's being overly optimistic. But that's -- the 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, that -- those are the deadlines we setup for our suppliers for parts delivery. And parts get made into cars. Cars need to get delivered. And thoseare 3 separate steps.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionOne last -- I just have my last question, just any color on cash burn? And I think last time, you mentionedthat you were confident you wouldn't need a capital raise. Do you still feel that way? I mean, I think it wasclose to $1 billion in the quarter, and it sounds like CapEx is going to rise next year. How should we thinkabout cash burn cadence and the confidence [indiscernible] no capital raise going forward?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell -- so this is really a question of what's the risk tolerance of the company or how close to the edgethat we want to go. According to our financial plan, no capital needs to be raised for the Model 3, but weget very close to the edge. So then that's probably not the best thing for shareholders on a risk-adjustedbasis. So we're considering a number of options, but I think it probably makes sense to raise capital toreduce risk.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerColin, I just want to add a couple of points there, too. [indiscernible] on the cash receiving [ph] end, wesee $1 billion in cash burn, but I don't think that's fully accurate. We had $522 million in CapEx. So we'reinvesting at a very healthy rate ahead of what we need to do for Model 3. And then there were certainlysome timing differences. We've talked about, in our deliveries press release, we had 2,750 cars that wemissed delivering them by a couple of days. So I think there's a little cross-quarter timing going on thereand it's not indicative of what cash flow from operations is going to look like in the future. Another -- togo -- circle back to your point and one of the questions from earlier about what's different about Model3, I thought maybe I'll provide just a little bit more color on costing, and this will help you think a littleabout margins on a go-forward basis, too. From the very beginning of the Model 3 program, the costingof the car was front and center and it's always been a key part of the conversation and the decisions thathave been made. And it goes all the way back to principles, as Elon likes to talk about. On a part-by-part basis, we've been looking at what is the value of the commodities in that part, what's a reasonablecost to fabricate the parts and what's a reasonable margin on top of it. And that's been the startingpoint for costing for everything that's gone into the Model 3. The other thing that's important -- and wetalked about this a lot over the past several quarters, is just being more efficient with our capital spend.I mean, J.B. has done a fabulous job with this up at the Gigafactory. I don't know if you had a chanceto attend the event or not, but the volumetric efficiency there is quite stunning. And if you can do morein a smaller footprint, the capital required is less. And the less capital is required to do things, the lessdepreciation load it's going to be on each unit produced once you get to volume production and deliveries.[indiscernible], it's going to be-- that's going to good to add additional color to your comments and yourquestions.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. That's sort of applying the rocket equation to manufacturing. And it's yes, volume -- essentially, therocket equation technique, it's mass efficiency. But I think volumetric efficiency of the factory, as Jason ismentioning, and then -- and X velocity of product from the factory kind of just slow it down pretty much tothose just -- those 2 things."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionJust a few questions about the cash flow and cash CapEx and cash needs. First, I recognize that you'renow consolidating in SolarCity. But if you were just to very roughly give us what the old automotiveadjusted cash flow was and try to kind of disentangle that from the cash flow coming out of the formerSolarCity, what would that roughly look like directionally?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. So I think we put in the letter that cash generation was $70 million, about $70 million. So SolarCitywas actually a cash generator for the 5-week stub period. Some of that was the cash and the tax equitydeals closing. So the way to think about SolarCity on a go-forward basis is prioritizing cash generationsthrough preservation over the near term for that business. So I don't anticipate any significant -- it's notgoing to have a significant impact on our cash position in future quarters.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. And secondly, the $2 billion to $2.5 billion CapEx guide, that spend, does that imply that that's nota full -- couple of questions. Does that imply that's not a full year 2017 number given that productioncadence that you're planning?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerCorrect. That's between now and the start of production for Model 3.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. And second, can you talk a little bit more about the deferral of cash out for CapEx due toagreements with suppliers or some of those equipment suppliers to defer payments? Just what are thoseagreements? Where does that liability show up on the balance sheet? And then is that a hard -- as soonthey deliver a proof part, does that come due? Or how does the actual timing of that payment work?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure, absolutely. So I think this is one of the benefits of having a very successful run over the lastcouple of years. We have developed a lot of trust with our suppliers. So when I started, we asked, \"Okay,what's our average days payables outstanding?\" and it was lower than it should be. And we've been ableto renegotiate the payment terms with just about everybody and stretch out those payables. And it's nota question of just not paying. It's actually we have trust and we're going -- renegotiating lease contractswith suppliers. And I believe we shared this data point last quarter on the call. But for the parts thathave been sourced for Model 3 so far, the average payment terms is 59 days. So cash conversion cycleis something that we care deeply about and we're paying a lot of attention to. And obviously, as we headup this S curve that we've talked about, working capital is going to be very important. So we're goingto have to keep a good eye on that. But to sum it up, we're making great progress in stretching out ourpayables, and we're doing that in a way that I think is productive and healthy with the relationships withour suppliers and members.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. So those deferred capital expenditure payments are actually in the accounts payable? Or is it inmore like an accrued liability line? Just housekeeping.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerIt depends on if there's -- many payments have milestones set to them, so when the piece of equipment isactually installed and up and running. And until you hit that milestone, you don't see a payable."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of James Albertine with Consumer Edge.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCI would just add my congratulations to Jason, and best of luck and then -- and welcome back to Deepak.If I may quickly, Elon, you mentioned in response to a ZEV question earlier, the 14 states, or I believeit was, that sort of share these standards and allow manufacturers to sort of earn credits, buy credits,allow you to sell credits and so forth, understanding that the extent that a competitor vehicle is sold inCalifornia, it counts toward their quota, if you will, in other states, and that the waiver that allows thatmight be expiring later this year. And I'm just wondering, number one, if that's correct, if I'm thinkingabout right way, and how that would theoretically impact your business. You've talked about how if sort ofthese $7,500 Federal -- I know I'm mixing ZEV and GHG and so forth. But you talked about how it couldtheoretically be a competitive advantage for Tesla, and I'm just wondering if you could sort of opine onthat.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, it's just that in order to scale, just to [indiscernible] a week -- it's like 1%, less than 1% or sometiny number of vehicles made in that state or sold in that state because we're the only ones who currentlymake a car in California. And I do think California maybe should do a bit more to support its onlyremaining auto manufacturer to remain competitive. The -- yes, it's weird that they need to do more tosupport non-California companies than Tesla. But it's -- this mandate becomes irrelevant at scale. Teslawill have as many more ZEV credits than the rest of the U.S. industry combined. So the value of them justdrops to a negligible number. And then they don't [indiscernible] major manufactures. They don't reallyneed to sell them either because they make whatever the puny amount of electric vehicles are, 20,000cars maybe. We're making 20x, 30x that number. So this is just -- they're just not as important at scalebecause the mandate are too weak.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCYes, understood. I was just sort of getting at the fact that maybe if the Volt sale in California doesn't counttoward New York or something that it's actually -- it's weaker. It's tougher for your competitors than iteven is today. So that's more what I was alluding to. And I agree with you that the mandate doesn't makea lot of sense.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. They're just very weak. So -- and yes, so they will have almost no impact on Model 3. Like maybe fora few quarters, that's about it.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCOkay, great. And if I may on the Model 3 quickly and then I'll get back in queue. The vehicle we've seen, isthat a preproduction version and -- or is that the fully -- the version you plan to fully produce? And if not,when could we maybe expect to see the fully sort of finished product? Just to get an idea -- you alluded toat the Gigafactory a couple of months ago, there is still some suppliers that you want to make sure you'relining up properly to get everything ready to go for July 1. And I'm wondering if the revealing of the finalproduction-ready version could be between now and then sort of an additional catalyst?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I'm not sure if it kind of makes sense for us to show the final version before starting productionor after. The initial cars are sort of [indiscernible] actually go to company employees because I thinkit's important for us to have a good feedback with on the product that we're making and if there areany issues or valuable things that need to be addressed that we can address those before customersexperience them. So I think in terms of showing a final version probably at least a few months away ormaybe as far as July itself, it's going to be pretty close to what I showed at the Model 3 unveiling butwith more polish and refinement and a few more details that are added. It will be better than what wasunveiled. And I guess in some ways, it will be a lot better."

And then I have a follow-up question on the debt that youdrew down in the fourth quarter.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerI'm sorry, you mean the full ramp to what level, to the 35 gigawatt hours per year or...Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionNo, no, just -- because this is a modular facility, right. So you've got new machines up and running. So the-- just the first tranche of equipment that you've installed. When is that going to be up and running at fullcapacity?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThey're very big modules.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, they're pretty large increments, but those will be up and running at full capacity for the first instanceswithin just a few months. We're already in the stages of -- or beginning the second instance of anode andcathodes, the electrode assembly. So I mean, these are needed for the ramp of Model 3. So that's[Audio Gap]Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Divisionyou have it done in the second quarter that is what I'm hearing you say, and then...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderFirst module and then if you're not -- modules look confusing to me because we actually have a module.The battery pack is divided into cells, modules and packs.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerFirst [indiscernible]Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderFirst line, actually.

And then on the $969 million that you've got in the bucket of debt activities, can you talkabout where -- just break down where that debt came from and how much borrowing capacity you haveentering the year with your current facilities?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, yes, Jason?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes. So the debt activity, this comes from draws on our asset-backed line and our warehouse lines. We'vegot a lot of cash in transit as we move through the quarters, particularly at the end of the quarters whenmaking deliveries. So we just want to make sure we have maximum liquidity as we close out quarters.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. It's particularly asset line essentially. That's almost entirely finished product in transit to a customerand to a noncustomer. So it's not general corporate debt. It's just like we finished the car, and it's got tobe transported to a customer overseas. And it may take 4 to 8 weeks to get there.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerThat's right. And that cash has been largely realized [indiscernible]Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, yes, yes, exactly..Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionOkay. And so where -- how can we think about borrowing capacity at this point on a go-forward basis?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSo we still had incremental capacity at the end of the quarter. We've been steadily -- we made someannouncements on this. We increased our warehouse line, which is a way for us to pull cash forward onour lease portfolios. And that's gone from 0 over -- in a year to $300 million then we had another $300million. So we got $600 million in capacity there. And our ABL has gone from $750 million at the beginningof the year to $1 billion and to $1.2 billion. So as we continue to build assets, we've got this ability to ouruse them to bring cash forward.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderAnd that's separate from general borrowing capacity.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, nonrecourse debt.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionOkay. I'll take the rest of it offline."

Taking a step back, looking at the bigger picture, you previously talked aboutproducing 1 million units per year by 2020, and that's 500,000 units in 2018. How confident are you nowin both of those targets? And is there anything that need to be done from the battery perspective side inorder to reach those targets? Would you need to build another Gigafactory prior to hitting 1 million unitsper year in 2020? Or do you think that the current Gigafactory will have enough capacity?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. So the -- depending on what you assume the average pack size is. But if you say it's somewherearound the 60 to 70 kilowatt hour level, then you need 70 gigawatt hours to get to 1 million. And we think-- at the cell level. And then we think the kind of Gigafactory should actually be able to do in excess of 100gigawatt hours. So that leaves probably a big Gigafactory 1 can manage -- it can support around probably1 million vehicles a year plus maybe something like 30 gigawatt hours or so of storage depending uponhow fast the storage market grows. But we -- I think the storage market has probably grown maybe twicethe rate of the automotive business, something like that.Tyler Charles FrankRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionOkay. So are you still on track, do you believe, for 1 million vehicles in 2020 and 500,000 in 2018? Andthen as a quick follow-up to Model 3, you had previously talked about 20% gross margin on that. When doyou think that margin target will be able to be achieved?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I currently think that we should build 0.5 million vehicles next year and 1 million vehicles by 2020,and that's -- yes, 0.5 million vehicles in total, S, 3 and X combined, next year should -- [indiscernible] asfar as I -- the information I have at my disposal right now, I believe that, that is the most likely outcome,and then with a couple more years getting to 1 million units. That seems also the most likely outcome,yes.Tyler Charles FrankRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionOkay. And then just a quick follow-up. Obviously with Jason leaving, it seems a little bit abrupt, butobviously, Deepak is welcome back. How -- should we think of this as a permanent situation? Or howshould we be thinking about the CFO position going forward?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, Deepak has come back in a long-term role.

I know you're talking about sort of CapEx upuntil Model 3. But can you give us any kind of breakout for -- maybe for if you just did it in percentageterms looking throughout the year, how much CapEx you're thinking for Model 3 versus Gigafactory andversus Solar?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. So we don't break down and we don't disclose the specifics here, but obviously, Gigafactory andModel 3 are going to be the biggest investments. We've also got CapEx investments in equipment andtooling related to Model 3. But then also, there's going to be a piece in CapEx on building out our serviceand our retail infrastructure as well and the Supercharger network. So it's the usual suspects.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderAnd solar glass, the solar glass tiles.Robert George CihraGuggenheim Securities, LLCYes. So I just -- if I could just ask one more. So on that solar glass tiles, I mean, is that -- you are lookingto start production, I guess whatever, later this year or ramp capacity? I mean, is that a meaningfulamount of CapEx for that? Or relatively speaking, it is not?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRelatively speaking, it's not.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerIt's pretty modest.Elon R.

We'll open it internally because sort of the first carswill go to Tesla employees and some investors as well that have been with Tesla so that -- so we canexperience any challenges before customers do.

        "paragraph": "And our next question is from the line of Jeff Osborne with Cowen and Company.Jeffrey David OsborneCowen and Company, LLC, Research DivisionTwo quick ones. One, was there a solar securitization in the quarter? And if so, how large was it? And thentwo, Elon, I believe at the Gigafactory event on January 4, you mentioned that there was some equipmentstamping tools and whatnot that needed to be put in place in Fremont. I was just curious, a, if thoseshowed up; and then, b, if you can just update us on what needs to be done from just a physical capacityto make the vehicle in July?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerTo answer, there is no solar securitization in Q4. There was one in Q1.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. And I know we're busy building up the stamping facility right now. The other question is whether thetime [indiscernible] that stamping line will be here, it's going to be here in advance of the Model 3. Butit's like the question is really how long does it take to work out the bugs in the stamping line and howmany iterations of this we'll have to go through to get it operating smoothly. But it will all be here andit will be a hive of activity. And I'll be personally down there, looking at the line, as I was when we putthe Model S line and [indiscernible] that I don't think that's going to be an issue. There are some longlead stamping tools, the stamping dies, and there's a lot of them. And there is some sort of -- some fairlyobscure sounding dyes, like the -- like one dye for, like, seat frame that -- it's currently a long lead item.But since we know about it, we're attacking it, and that's unlikely to be a scheduled driver.

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionI was hoping just to get a few more points to calibrate to expected free cash flow breakeven at the motorscompany and when you -- I guess, there's a couple of things on this. One is you mentioned that theCapEx of $2 billion to $2.5 billion is until the Model 3 launch. Can you just give us an idea of what you'reexpecting for the full year? What the rate would be post launch of Model 3?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, right now and maybe I said earlier, I think we're just focusing on our first half guidance rather thanthe second half. I mean, there's going to be lots of exciting things going on in the second half of the yearwith solar. There has been Model 3 getting to scale and everything else. So we're just focused on that atthis point in time.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI mean, there's obviously going to be a fair bit of incremental investment to go from 5,000 cars a weekto 10,000 cars a week, but it's going to be a lot less than getting to 5,000 cars a week in the first place.We don't know exactly what that's going to be except I'm confident it will be less because the first thingwe will try to increase our output is -- going back to rocket equation is to increase exit last year with theline, and we don't know exactly where the 2 points are going to be. We try to model it out as carefullyas possible, but there'll be things that aren't captured in the model and -- but I think in a lot of cases,we'll simply be able to run the lines faster as opposed to duplicate the line and that's like, by far, the bestCapEx maneuver, is just to make it go faster but -- I would say it's going from 5,000 to 10,000 is probably-- it's a total wild ass guess. So that's the way we think about it, but it's like 30%, 50% to 70% of thecost of the 5,000 line, something like that. [indiscernible] get lucky and smart, that's the -- that's onlyhalf again, which obviously is pretty awesome from a CapEx standpoint. I can't imagine it being more thanabout 70% as much as the original. And J.B., what do you think?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, that -- I think that's right. And it's really helpful to realize that a lot of the infrastructure investmentsto get all the way to 10,000 are already completed, Gigafactory, in particular. So it's not as if -- even as ifwe're starting from scratch. It's to go from 5,000 to 10,000.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThat's true. I mean, some things where it's like -- well, you can spend 10% more, like in a really goodcase. You spend 10% more and have twice as much capacity, and like okay, sure. It's not great in theshort term but it's obviously a good thing in the long term.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerBut where there were great efficiencies in the way to lay out a facility, for instance, that there were atGigafactory. So -- and there, we don't anticipate needing to build much new square footage, for instance,to go all the way to 10k even though we would be expanding the internal production lines while we speedthem up. And add new instance of the production, the Tesla CapEx would not be a 1:1 scale, not evenclose.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionCould you comment on the run rate of OpEx for 2017 for the motors company or for the whole company?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. I think the way to think about it is we're going to continue to drive efficiencies in G&A. We have todo that.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, in parking because we can't fit people in the building.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIt seems like that's the only concern but, like, we're -- it's really quite difficult.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerWe have a real volumetric problem, a good constraint to have.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSo parking is, like, one of my biggest nightmares, like where do we park everyone? And it's like -- yes,you can't fit everyone. So we have to make our OpEx better because there's nowhere for people to go.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSo we're right at the stage now where G&A will continue to scale sublinearly with revenue. And we'llcontinue to always push productivity, productivity, productivity. And then we'll obviously continue to makeinvestments on the sales side. And even in my new adventures, I'll be calling Jon and asking him about hisnumbers.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, it's [indiscernible] from a demand generation standpoint, like we don't actually need to make actuallyany investment for Model 3 in the year, probably for the next 12 months. So the -- it's actually, thedelivery of the cars that -- where the investment is needed [indiscernible] deliver 3 or 4x as many cars,but we don't have 3x or 4x as many delivery centers. So how do we make that delivery process morestreamlined, less paperwork, less bureaucracy, get people at a time, really well-produced instructionvideos for how to use their car, although of course, the best instruction would be not having instructions.And you'll actually be able to like, play all of the instruction for your car on your car. So if you don't wantto have [indiscernible] look at that. If you look at your email or get on the car but there's -- a sale isactually demand generation and then delivery of the car. It's -- that's also part of sales of [indiscernible]part and then service. We're deciding on [indiscernible] intervention, like we were -- we increased thedesign lifetime of the powertrain to -- from roughly 1/4 million miles to, aspirationally, 1 million miles. Sothat should really help with service and...Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionI guess just still trying to calibrate to this cash flow and cash needs. Is it -- maybe a different way to askthis is, is it reasonable to expect that you would hit for the motors company free cash flow breakeven atthe 250,000 unit a year level for Model 3, assuming what we know today?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIt depends on how quickly we want to ramp production to go from 5k a week to 10k a week of Model 3.There could be an argument that you don't want to go to cash flow breakeven or positive because you'reessentially -- you're losing a lot of sales. And when you do -- when you calculate the present value ofthese cash flows, then it's like actually not smart to be, in that case, free cash flow positive. Or you maybewant to be a little negative at least and not give up a huge number of sales because we'd be talking -- thenumbers get just so crazy. It's 0.25 million units a year. It's roughly $1 billion a month revenue. And so --and you double that and there's $2 billion a month advanced. So maybe spending half -- incremental $0.5billion or -- in CapEx would be a pretty smart move if it advances things by 2 or 3 months.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionYes. So it just seems like at that level of 250,000, you'd be generating probably at least $2 billion of grossprofit for Model 3. And if you continue this Model X rate, you're at $2.5 billion of gross from that. So evenwith OpEx, if it's just under $3 billion and CapEx of just under $3 billion, if you add in D&A, it looks like it'spretty close. But I understand, it sounds like it's within your control.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIt's within our control. I mean, like, if we were to just level off, we could be cash flow positive right now.Obviously, we're in the sort of low to mid-20s on gross margin in the car. At a $10 billion a year runrate, that's $2 billion to $2.5 billion. So we could definitely be profitable and cash flow positive at thatlevel, but then our growth rate would be way slower. So it's kind of just really like a series of overlapping[indiscernible] NPV streams, like that's obvious the obvious way to look at it. And by the way, guys, itwould be great to get some feedback if you think we're not making a smart move. Please tell us, like we'dlove to hear your feedback. We'll definitely not going to hit the bull\u2019s-eye every time. We're going to makemistakes. And hearing feedback from you would be great."
