As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Jeff Evanson. Sir, the floor is yours.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsThank you, Huey, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's second quarter Q&A webcast. I'mjoined today by Elon Musk, Tesla Chairman and CEO; J.B. Straubel, our CTO; and Deepak Ahuja, Tesla'sCFO.Our Q2 results are announced in the shareholder letter at the same link as this webcast. As usual, theletter includes GAAP and non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation between the 2.During our call, we will discuss our business outlook and will make forward-looking statements, which arebased on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially dueto a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent Form 10-Q filed withthe SEC.And now Huey, let's go to the first question, please."

        "paragraph": "Our first question will come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionJust a first question on the pre-owned program. It seems like there's a fair level of success there with$20 million in revenue. I'm just curious if you could mention how many vehicles were sold throughthat program, how many units remain in inventory there. And if we think about how that inventory isrestocked, sort of what percentage of new unit Model Ss that are purchased are accompanied by a ModelS trade-in?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectAll right, one second.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerJohn, Deepak here. Firstly, we just kicked off the program in April, so it's actually been pretty hearteningto see how it's done so far. And to keep it at a high level, we're actually selling these cars at a fasterrate than we are getting these trade-ins to come in. So as this program picks up, it's going to really be asuccessful program, and it's creating good demand for us on the pre-owned side.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I'd hesitate to make predictions based on such early history. But I mean, I think there's room foroptimism in the future here because these are obviously very low -- we're not going to have to make thecars. So we're essentially getting a commission on selling the car, and it's very capital efficient. So I thinkthere's some upside potential there, but nothing we want to sort of really make predictions on until wehave more history.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionOkay. Maybe to think about it sort of in terms of -- I mean, every vehicle that's going into this pre-ownedprogram, I would imagine, is accompanied with a new Model S sale. I'm just trying to understand how theacquisition process is working.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAbsolutely, yes. Yes, we accept a trade-in only when that customer is buying a new Model S, if that's whatyou're trying to suggest.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionYes, that was sort of what I was trying to get at and understand the percentages, but I guess it's too smallright now to be too material.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionThe second question, as we think about the referral program, an interesting marketing angle here. Justwondering if you can sort of juxtapose what you think the ultimate cost was. It looks like it's about $2,000all-in versus your acquisition cost per customer. I'm just trying to understand where you're going to savemoney and how this makes the sort of the customer acquisition process more cost effective.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, it's not necessarily making it more cost effective. It's intended to be somewhat of a wash so thatif we achieve a $2,000 savings, we essentially pass that on to the end customer. And we don't knowwhat that's really going to look like until the program is complete, which is sort of almost 90 days fromnow. Our early indications are quite positive, but obviously, for this 90-day period, there's going to besome overlap where we essentially incur dual expense for -- because we're not -- we still have all ofour stores and we're -- have the referral costs. So I don't think it's going to have a big impact on ournumbers, but it's -- there will be some dual expense because there's no way -- you have to kind of runthese experiments in parallel, so there's really no way to do it otherwise.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionAnd how did you build up the $2,000 acquisition cost? Because as you mentioned, it seems like there's lotof fixed costs that wouldn't get taken out that quickly in the test phase. I'm just trying to understand howyou think about that $2,000 number and how you come up with that.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, it's not taken out in the test phase. It's to inform our long-term decision in terms of how many storesshould we open. The store [indiscernible] demand generation item. And in order to understand should wedo a lot of stores, a small number of stores, somewhere in between, we kind of need to know how thisreferral program -- how effective our program is. If you can think of some other way to do this that we'renot aware of, we'd love to hear about it.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionSure, we'll brainstorm on that. Then just lastly, as we think about the cash burn in the quarter, but alsothe setup of the credit lines, it seems like you guys are recognizing that at some point down the line, theremight be a need for a capital raise. Would you consider an equity raise in the market? Or do you thinkthese credit lines are enough to lean on for now before you ultimately have to make a decision on raisingcapital in the next 12 to 18 months?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, we only drew down $15 million on our credit lines, so we have sufficient lines available. And that'sexpandable, too, to $750 million, which gives us some comfort that we can be close to $1 billion as wego through the year. And clearly, as X ramps up and gets to a steady state, it enables us to generate freecash flow. So we feel pretty comfortable overall on that front, and we'll just take it as opportunities comein the future.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionSo Deepak, do you think as you go through the launch of the Model X and ultimately the Model 3, thatyou'll turn cash flow positive at the right point where you might not need to do a capital raise goingforward? Is that kind of how you're thinking about this with the credit lines on top?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. I mean, we are comfortable with the cash levels, I'll put it that way.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI don't think that -- there's not a need to raise equity capital. There may be some value in doing soas a risk reduction measure. But to be clear, what Deepak is saying is that even in the absence of anyadditional capital generation activity, we would have in order of $1 billion through the year. Basically, thatwill be our minimum cash position.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionNo, I think the risk reduction function you mentioned is probably the most valuable, and that's kind of whywe're asking about that. When you look at the cash burn and how the capital markets sometimes shiftvery quickly, it just seems like an opportune time to take advantage of what you might need in the future.So that's why we're asking.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. So I mean -- I think we're in sort of the same sort of mind frame as you are."

        "paragraph": "Our next phone question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionA couple of questions. First, maybe you can just elaborate a little bit on the drop in the forecast from55,000 to 50,000 to 55,000. Is there some aspect of the Model X launch that isn't what you projected? Itdoesn't really sound like this is related at all to the backlog of orders from Model S.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectCorrect. I mean, we do think that it's going to be quite a challenging production ramp on the X. And ifwe are faced with a choice of -- to deliver a great -- we only want to deliver great cars. So we don't wantto drive to a number that's greater than our ability to deliver high-quality vehicles. And the nature ofthe production ramp, which is basically an exponential ramp that then becomes an S-curve, is basicallyfor every week, the longer it takes to climb up that exponential is about an 800-vehicle reduction of theX. But that's why we sort of we do want to emphasize the longer term, longer term really just meaninglike Q1 next year type of thing for long term. I think one gets a better picture of the business just sortof thinking about that. And that's where we feel really highly confident of the 1,600 to 1,800 combinedproduction of S and X, and both production and demand.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. Was there an adjustment from something like 2,000 units a week to that 1,600 to 1,800? And arewe thinking about like a 48-week production year? Or are you thinking about this in terms of the fullcalendar year?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, so that's a good question. It's like -- they are -- yes, that's average over the year. So that means likein a given week, we might go as high as 2,000 to make up for holidays, factory retooling and that kind ofthing.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. Your run rate of gross margin, obviously, it's being affected by a number of things, by launches,by mix, the deferral of Autopilot revenue. Can you just talk a little bit about what are some of the issuesthere? What is the issue with Autopilot? Would we -- would it be reasonable to expect the margins to riseagain to the 25%-plus level once X is out and Gigafactory begins to ramp?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, definitely. Most of the Autopilot deferral, we should be able to recover that later this year and maybea small portion going to 2016, but difficult to say at this point. And the 2 big issues that have beenaffecting us, I'd say, is the dollar, the strong dollar, and then the mix, especially as we have started tobuild 70D and the [indiscernible] Cars recently. The dollar has had huge impact. Just from Q1 to Q2, ittook 100 basis out for us roughly. So even after we consider all that and we look at 2016 to say that we'llbe at 25% and better, but the mix combined, yes, we should be there.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionOkay. And just lastly, you've had a few more weeks here since the announcement of the stationary storagebusiness. Do you have any additional thoughts on how that's expected to ramp?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. I want to back this with some degree of uncertainty because this is quite new. And again, we gotthat challenge of exponential ramp. And then depending on how you move, depending on how the baseover the next exponential ramp, the actual numbers within a given quarter could be quite different. Butthe demand has been really crazy, so it's well in excess -- I mean, if you just take the reservations thatwe made thus far, it's for well over $1 billion worth of Powerpacks and Powerwalls. And that's with nomarketing, no advertising, and no sales force to speak of really. We're not trying to sell it. It's basically apresentation and a webcast and 30 minutes of press Q&A. So there's probably room to improve. The -- sothis is -- I mean, we're really, we're basically sold out of what we could make in 2016 at this point, andassuming these orders are real, which we assume to be. So we're looking at maybe -- again, tracked thiswith a point [ph] of uncertainty, 40 million to 50 million in stationary storage in Q4, and maybe as muchas 10x that number in -- for next year. So it's 40 million to 50 million this year and 10x that next year.And I mean that growth rate is probably going to keep going at quite a level. It's probably at least a fewbillion dollars in 2017. But it's only speculative at this point, but I think that's likely. So it's sort of growingby half order of magnitude to an order of magnitude per year."

        "paragraph": "And our next question will come from Trip Chowdhry with Global Equities Research.Trip ChowdhryGlobal Equities Research, LLCA couple of questions regarding the validation units. I was wondering regarding Model X, do we have ageneral ballpark number in terms of how many validation units we may have to produce before the robotsbecome smart enough?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI'm not sure I totally understand your question.Trip ChowdhryGlobal Equities Research, LLCLike when we had the Model S retooling, we created few a Model S validation units, I think probablyaround 40 or 50 units, which were used to train the robots. So before the product really goes intoproduction, I do believe there are some validation units of the car that are produced so as to train therobots. I could be wrong, but that's my understanding.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectNo, that's true. There are actually -- it's a little bit more complicated than that because there are parts ofthe factory that are much more automated than other parts. So in terms of the programming the robots,it varies quite a bit in terms of how much program there is, how difficult their programming is. But weactually have now produced several Model Xs off the Tesla production line. But this is a complex machinewith several thousand unique components. So there are still a lot of low-volume parts from the supplierson the Model X. But with each week, we keep building more and more Xs off the line with greater andgreater product maturity. And then as [indiscernible], we expect to draw our first delivery of productionModel Xs at the end of next month.Trip ChowdhryGlobal Equities Research, LLCI had a question on the Autopilot. I was wondering, are you aware of this research paper from LX [ph]?I think they also call it LX [ph]. In 2 conferences we ran, they talked a lot about image classification,especially with Nvidia. And if you haven't heard about it, that's fine. But if you have heard about it, I waswondering, are we working with some similar technologies with Autopilot? Or are we doing everything in-house in terms of image recognition and auto sharing?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectThe overall system is designed by Tesla, but then there's components from a number of other suppliers.The Autopilot that -- or the orders there -- Highway autopilot essentially is using a combination of theforward camera, forward radar, the side ultrasonics and then the GPS navigation system. So it integratesthose 4 systems in order to autosteer on the highway. And yes, so that's sort of what we're working at thefinal details on. We're targeting release to early-access customers on August 15. And then depending uponhow that is received and what issues we encounter in different parts of the world, we expect to go to widerelease our Autopilot and autopark in 1 to 2 months after that.Trip ChowdhryGlobal Equities Research, LLCLast question I have regarding the calendar year 2016 production. I was wondering, in 2015, this currentyear, we are having a few retooling and getting the assembly lines, or I should say the production lines ofModel X and Model S a little up and coming. Do we see any similar disruption happening in 2016? Or arepretty much straight? And when we will put the Model 3 line in place, it will be completely isolated fromModel X and Model S?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectThere are periodic down periods in order to do equipment maintenance, where that can't be accomplishedin, let's say, on a Saturday, Sunday. But we're not anticipating any significant downtime for S and X.It's just sort of like maybe it's 1 or 2 weeks out of the year, something like that. And because we doproductivity improvements to reduce the production costs, and yes, just general equipment maintenance.For the Model 3, we really are doing our best to make sure that it does not affect S and X production. Wedon't currently anticipate it affecting S and X production in 2016, but there may be some effect in 2017.Trip ChowdhryGlobal Equities Research, LLCIf I may squeeze in one more. You did mention that Model X production is challenging. Like there's adifference between saying doable and undoable, and everything is challenged in the world. Like I waswondering like we have a control over this challenge because every problem is -- if it's not -- we'd neverenjoy something not challenging. Are you saying it somewhat challenging like it is out of control, orchallenging because you are enjoying doing it?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, I think there's -- some things are definitely a lot more challenging than others. And the Model X is, Ithink, particularly challenging car to build, maybe the hardest car to build in the world. I'm not sure whatwould be harder. But it is an amazing vehicle, and I think it's going to blow people away."

        "paragraph": "Our next question in queue comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionFirst question, Steve Jurvetson was recently quoted saying that Uber CEO Travis Kalanick told him that ifby 2020, Tesla's cars are autonomous, then he'd want to buy all of them. Is this a real -- I mean, forgetlike the 2020 for a moment. But is this a real business opportunity for Tesla supplying cars to ridesharingfirms? Or does Tesla just cut out the middleman and sell on-demand electric mobility services directly fromthe company on its own platform?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectThat's an insightful question.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionYou don't have to answer it.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI think -- I don't think I should answer it.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionOkay, let's move on. Second question is, there's been -- sometimes you can tell more from a non-answerthan from the answer. There's been a lot of excitement about mapping technology for autonomous andsemiautonomous applications, with a German consortium bidding firm for here [ph] Nokia's business. SoI'd love to hear your views, Elon, on how you view Tesla's mapping capabilities. Is this something youneed to license -- continue licensing from outside vendors? Or can you use your own unique connectedmachine learning suite to build your own mapping capabilities and be self-sufficient? Or you'd rather notanswer that one?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, the fact of the matter is there is not publicly available data that is sufficiently accurate for Autopilotas far as navigation data, street data. It's too coarse. So it looks like we don't really have much choicebut to create our own data set for driving in order to -- in the long term in order to provide a high qualityAutopilot experience. But yes, I mean, that's just the only way we can think of to do it good."

        "paragraph": "Our next question in queue will come from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionFirst question is, I'm just curious what the new guidance for a range of deliveries, 50k to 55k versus 55kprior. What does that mean, if anything, for the earlier target of free cash flow breakeven in 4Q? Is thatsomething we should think about maybe more in 1Q '16 then?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerCertainly in 1Q, we will be free cash flow positive. Q4, it's hard to predict given that range. Certainlytowards the end as Model X deliveries are ramping up, we will be. But then, if you look at the full quarter,it's somewhat a close call.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOkay, okay. That's helpful. And then last question, it seems like we've seen a number of announcementsin the third quarter now by utilities and other companies about using your Powerpack, companies likeAmazon, et cetera. I'm curious how much of the Tesla energy business do you now expect to generatefrom corporate or institutional demand versus more retail customers? I'd be interested too if this mix andexpectation, if it's changed over time at all since you first debuted the product.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerSure. This is J.B. We're getting a little bit better sense of it, but it's still early days. And I think initially,we thought that the majority of the business would be the Powerpack and the commercial or institutionalbusiness. And we've actually been a bit surprised at how strong Powerwall, the retail demand is and theinterest is. So again, it's hard to guess at numbers, but I would say that we're perhaps in the -- -- maybenot quite close to 50-50, but I think 70% perhaps Powerpack.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, it's really early days. Because a big dependency here is when someone orders the Powerpack, howmany Powerpacks do they order? And so Powerpacks sort of 100 kilowatt hours, and industrial and utilitycustomers may order as many as 100 or 200. I'm not sure how our biggest order went so far. Is it like200?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerIt's [indiscernible] that, yes, on that order of magnitude.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, yes. So I think our biggest one is around 250 or so. So the -- yes, it could be quite a large, in termsof kilowatt hours, quite a large amount going in the direction of Powerpack. In terms of unit volume, thePowerwall would be the greatest. But the likely thing for Powerwall is somebody is going to order maybe 1to 3, maybe it's an average of 1.5 or something like that, whereas Powerpack could be an average of 5 to10.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, and I think as the market grows and as we go further into the future, we're going to see more andmore total energy demand coming from Powerpack. That's still our expectation.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, exactly. I mean, one thing to understand. [indiscernible] drawing this a little bit that for stationarystorage, the fundamental economics of cost are always true, meaning that there's always a costadvantage to someone -- to a systemwide implementation of stationary storage because of the high peakto trough electricity usage. So if you have buffering, which is what a stationary storage allows for, thenyou only need your power plants to operate at the average energy usage, which means that you canbasically, in principle, shut down half of the world's power plants if you have stationary storage. This isindependent of renewable energy. It does not matter whether you have solar panels or wind. This is justbeing able to shut down half of your power plants if you have buffering. Because you can then have yourpower plant output at the average of what is needed by the consumers. It seems like sometimes peoplelink this too much to renewable energy. Of course, we're huge believers in renewable energy, but thatis not the gating function of demand for stationary storage, stationary storage is really as compared toexisting power plants. And depending on the country, that may be represented at -- as a price to the userof the electricity. So for example in Germany and Australia, there is time-based cost of electricity. It'sgoing to cost more sometimes today than others. Whereas in most of the U.S., you just have a meterthat's taking over. So it doesn't differentiate between, say, day use of energy or night use of energy. Soin places where the price represents the cost, the Powerwall makes economic sense. But the Powerpackmakes sense everywhere."

        "paragraph": "Our next phone question will come from Patrick Archambault with Goldman Sachs.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionI just wanted to follow up on the Autopilot, and I'm sorry if you guys have said this. But can we talk alittle bit more about the capability that that's going to bring? Is that kind of a hands-off feet-off kind ofproduct that would be somewhere close to like NHTSA Level 3? Or are we just talking about kind of morelane keep assist and forward collision warning, that sort of stuff that, that would still be kind of 1 to 2? Letme just start off with that question.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I'm not sure I'm familiar with what the various NHTSA levels mean, but I'll tell you what it willtranslate to in initial Autopilot. But we don't want to set the expectation that it's -- that you can justbasically pay no attention to what the car is doing. We do want to set the expectation that it's much likethe autopilot in a plane, where you turn the autopilot on in a plane but there's still the expectation thatthe pilot will pay attention to what the plane is doing and won't sort of go to sleep or disappear fromthe cockpit. So we don't want to set that expectation with the consumers. That said, in terms of whatthe capability of the system is, I think its capability in steering and control of acceleration and braking isexcellent when it has a tracking vehicle in front. And you can basically have high confidence in steering,braking and acceleration basically when you're in some kind of traffic situation, where there's a car in theroad in front of you. I think it's pretty good in the absence of that. So if there's just lanes, it's pretty good,and then it will get better over time as we refine the software. So we certainly don't take the initial versionof Autopilot as the final version. It will just get better and better over time. Just with software updates,just with software updates, to be clear.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionAnd then I take that there's some kind of human-machine interface thing that keeps you focused andbeeps if you try and use your BlackBerry or something.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectThat's still something that we're debating. And I think we want to see how well the access program goes.That's basically our public data. And based on that, we'll set the warning levels, yes.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionGot it. More of a guidance question. It was touched on earlier that the 1,600 to 1,800 is down from I thinkwhat was being floated around as 2,000 for next year's production level. I get that the production overallmight be lower based on a slower ramp. But is there something structural that's keeping you from hittingthat 2,000 on a run-rate basis, understanding that you can kind of surge to that at certain points? Is theresomething that you've kind of been preparing for the launch, you've realized that you're just not going tohave the capacity that you thought you would have?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectFrankly, the main thing is we don't want to set high expectations. And then -- the only way for us to feelgood about the future is that if we exceed really high expectations. So it's sort of like winning needs tofeel like winning, if that makes any sense. So that's really what why we're sort of setting these numbers,all right. Could we do 2,000? Aspirationally, yes. Do we want to commit to that? Ideally not.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionGot it. I understood. Just setting the bar at achievable levels is something that makes sense. And thenjust last one for me, like an accounting issue. I think there was like a $0.10 gain or a $0.13 gain on like FXrevaluation, like -- I don't know, Deepak, I didn't know what that was exactly.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, that's driven by our balance sheet currency and receivables revaluations that happened at the quarterend exchange rates. It's not really -- it's not representative of what happens during the quarter, duringthe middle of the months. And based on where the exchange rates were, we had good news this timefrom that revaluation. Clearly, as you are aware, Q1, we had significant bad news. And if you really net itthroughout on a full year basis, it's a small number.Patrick Kenehan ArchambaultGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionOkay, I got it. So it's just the impact of transactional stuff sequentially?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. Okay. Just to clarify, there's translational and transactional in the sense that we have foreigncurrencies on hand, which we are translating to dollars at quarter end, and that impact has to flowthrough income.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectBut we haven't actually done the exchange.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, yes. It's unrealized. There is some realized portion that happened during the quarter. Most of it isunrealized.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes."

        "paragraph": "Next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.Emmanuel RosnerCLSA Limited, Research DivisionI wanted to start just with a quick math question. So your comment suggested that the -- if there's anysort of delay towards the end of Q4, this would have an impact of about 800 Model X units per week. Andthen you're also guiding to about 1,600 to 1,800 combined volumes of production per week next year.Does that just simplistically mean that you're targeting the mix to be roughly 50-50 between X and S rightfrom the get-go in 2016?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectIt does. Although it's -- I wouldn't put too much precision on that because what we're going to try todo is to push the production slightly more in the direction of X because people have been waiting fora long time for their cars. And then in any given month, it could be 60-40 one way or the other. If youlook at worldwide demand for SUVs and sedans, it's almost dead even at 50-50. And in some regions,sedan's a favorite; some regions, SUV is a favorite. But generally it's, on a worldwide basis, 50-50. But itis difficult for us to say exactly what the S, X demand ratio will be until the car is out there and people areexperiencing it and we see what the relative order volume is. But we have so many advanced orders onthe X that that's something -- are not going to be an issue in the early days and we are going to try to getpeople their car as fast as we can.Emmanuel RosnerCLSA Limited, Research DivisionOkay. So I understand the demand aspect but I guess from a production capacity point of view, you thinkthat as of early 2016, you could theoretically have as many X as Model S that's being produced?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. I mean to sort of put our cards on the table here, we're setting factory capacity to be 1,000 Ss and1,000 Xs per week. This is capacity -- what -- actual production and capacity are not exactly the samething. So there's always some percentage lower than the capacity that is -- or like occasionally, youmay hit capacity, but it's hard to maintain capacity. But our goal is -- what our internal plan is, I can tellyou, is that we want the factory to be able make up to 1,000 Xs, up to 1,000 Ss per week next year and-- in terms of capacity. And then actual production, it is affected by real world issues, so there will bemaybe some weeks where there is 2,000 produced and some weeks where there's very few producedbecause we've got factory tooling situations, hence, the 1,600 to 1,800 average over the year that we'repredicting.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerIt would be fair to say the goal of the factory is to not just produce cars, but it's to produce cars with theright cost and the right quality.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, yes. But particularly, I mean once we hit steady state, we can certainly do that. But it's just difficultduring the ramp phase, yes.Emmanuel RosnerCLSA Limited, Research DivisionOkay, that's very clear. And then one question on China. So very happy to see that your revised strategyis getting some traction. So what exactly are you doing differently there, I guess, besides offering a homecharger for the buyers of Model S? Are there any other things you're doing differently in China? And anylessons that you can learn from there in terms of applying that through to other regions?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, China is -- does have a unique set of challenges. For example, there's the whole license platequestion. To get a license plate to drive a car in a lot of the major Chinese cities is quite difficult. Sowhether you have the electric vehicle exemption in a given city or not makes a big difference becauseif you don't, then people can buy the car but they can't drive it. So we've been -- it's taken us a whilebut we've been successful in getting EV plate exemptions in -- everywhere except Beijing. And we'reoptimistic about Beijing. We're seeing Beijing exemption in the future, hopefully, near future. So that'simportant for China, but not something that one can extend to other parts of the world. The -- I think the-- yes, I mean it's -- I think it's really just that in China, and in most countries, that there is a bit of a slowboat of awareness and confidence in Tesla. And depending upon when we went to market in a particularcountry, that feeling is going to be at a low or a high stage of maturity. In say, in the U.S., say particularlyCalifornia, it's a high stage of maturity. The awareness and comfort with Tesla in California is very high.And -- but that's sort of a kind of moderate stage of maturity in, say, the northeast of the United Statesand still at the low stage in most of Asia. And the same has been true in Europe. Basically, it seems likewith every country, you've got to build confidence in the brand over time. And it's -- it just takes time. Youcan't have it be immediate. And just because people love it in California does not mean they automaticallylove it in other places. You've got to build confidence over time, yes.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerWe have been in China only slightly over a year.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, just a year.Emmanuel RosnerCLSA Limited, Research DivisionUnderstood. And then final one just on the Gigafactory. Can you just give us an update on how thingsare going there in terms of the preparation? And then there was also -- I think you've been mentioninga bunch of hints throughout the months on potentially wanting to add some space there, adding somecapacity. Can you talk I guess more precisely in terms of where would we see capacity go beyond sort ofthe initial stages.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, I'll say a few words and maybe J.B. can weigh in. I mean whenever engaging in speculativecomments like this. I think it is important just to remember they are speculative and not a predictionthat we would have, say, with very high confidence. But what we have found is -- with the Gigafactory,is that as we spent more and more time on it, we found we've been able to improve the space efficiencyof the production and the overall efficiency by more than our initial expectations. So the net result is thatwe think in the same volume, we can do potentially significantly more output. J.B., do you want to divearound that?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, I think our plans are still on track and unchanged for the first phases of production to support Model3 and to support the Tesla energy business. But the ultimate production capability of the site is whatwe believe can go much higher than we may be initially thought it could. And we do remain on track forconstruction at the site. We'll have first equipments being installed at end of this year and planning tostart production on Tesla Energy products in Q1 2016.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectAnd in -- for Gigafactory, we're already in production...Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, Fremont.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, we're already in production with Tesla Energy products in Fremont, but that production will transfer tothe Gigafactory next year.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerAnd expand and ramp significantly.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes."

        "paragraph": "Our next phone question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionI've got two questions, one on the Powerwall -- excuse me, Powerpack opportunity, and another relatingback to Model S, Model X. On the Powerpack, I want to get sort of a deeper understanding of whereyou see your competitive advantage. As I think about simplicity 4 levels of a stack in terms of the utilityPowerpack solution with the upper level being sort of the grids. Software to interface with the grid kind oftie in when it's needed, when it's not needed. Second layer is the battery management software and thenat the hardware, the inverter and other power electronics followed by the battery itself. Where do you seeyour advantage at each of those levels? How is it important to play at all of those levels? And how do youinterface with some of the existing middle people, you might call them, or consultants in the industry orother software providers who might be providing elements of the stack already?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerLook, it's a pretty detailed question. I think one of the -- maybe the high level, one of the biggest benefitsthat we offer and where we have a competitive strength is having a system that solves pretty much all ofthose problems together. I think a lot of other people aspiring to be in this market sell one piece amongthat entire stack, as you're calling it, and then you'd have to go to different companies to find the otherpieces. In Tesla, we're integrating all those pieces together for a very turnkey solution that a utility or acommercial customer can just install. I think...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, basically, plug and play matters even if you're at the megawatt scale.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, exactly. And I think, of course, the pricing fundamentals, starting with the battery itself are reallythe foundation of that. But -- we have a lot of expertise and a lot of know-how in power electronics andsoftware as well that we've built on the car side of the business for many years.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionAnd how about the software to interface with the grid and determine when to charge, when to discharge?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, that's something we're working on now. And we're also working in partnership with many differentutilities on this. There's not a -- perhaps a universal point of view on exactly where that control and sortof dispatch should live. A lot of utilities want to be very involved in that themselves. So we're basicallysetting up the tools and the infrastructure so that they can control in a way that's familiar and the mostconvenient for them.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectAnd especially like an API -- it's especially like the API so that their utility system can essentially call --can put or call power to the pack. And then they can query the pack for information about its status. Butas J.B. was saying, like, it does have to interface with quite a heterogeneous set of systems around theworld. So that's why you have to have basically an API interface to the pack saying sort of that the utilitysystem can request power or put power to the pack.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, and maybe just one more comment. At the commercial level, that is something that Tesla is engagedin much more directly for things like demand management and those type of applications. But it's a bit ofa different answer depending on which market we're in here.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionAnd so how are you giving the utilities comfort with the cycle -- number of cycles and the lifetime of this?Are they sort of taking your word for it? Or is that something they're seeking to explore through pilotsand/or their own high-intensity testing of your battery packs?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, we have a lot of data, actually. It's not -- they don't just have to take our word for it. A lot of thesetests have been running for a long time, and we can show them fairly hard cycle data and some lifetimedata. So that's been very helpful. And also of course, there's all the sort of field experience from theautomotive fleet. That is much bigger than what we're deploying in the stationary fleet and will remain sofor a number of years. So having the confidence there and how those batteries have aged and done quitewell is extremely helpful in building out our confidence.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionGot it. And just final quick question. Model S, you noted some risk to 4Q depending on what happens withthe X ramp-up. Earlier in the year, you talked about a 30% gross margin for the Model S prior to 4Q, ofcourse that was not for 4Q overall. Where do you stand on that 30% internal goal now?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, that 30% goal was before the dollar began to really strengthen at this level. So clearly, that has hada fairly large impact on it. And also, the mix had some impact. Our focus also in the last few quarters hasbeen much more so on Model X. There are various other cost reduction opportunities that we have that weare hoping to get in Q4 but they could potentially get delayed into Q1. We want to make sure they happenright. And we are, at the same time, focusing on X. so I would say, broadly, if we put aside exchange, wesee a trend of improving gross margin despite mix over time.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. But no longer a hard 30% in 4Q?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectIt -- no, not in -- not next quarter basically. But next year, contingent on macroeconomic conditions notgoing wacky, that seems like a -- potentially an attainable number."

        "paragraph": "Next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionCan I just follow-up on some of the numbers you threw out on stationary storage? The $1 billion, isthat orders or reservations? I just want to get a sense of how firm that was. And did you imply that -- itsounds like 400 -- $400 million to $500 million for next year? And is it a few billion for 2017 at the storagemarket? Is that what you said?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes. These are reservations, so you can -- reservation may be an order or maybe not, but that's certainlywhat people said that they want. The -- yes, so that's over 100,000 reservations have been placedfor Powerwall and Powerpack. And of that, there's -- you can suspect that is what the -- how manyPowerwalls and how many Powerpacks per reservation. It's likely to be more than 1, so -- particularly onthe Powerpack case. So yes, that's what leads us to think $40 million to $50 million Q4, maybe 10x thatnumber next year, and then 5x to 10x that number in 2017. But as I said earlier, as we get further away intime, the numbers are more speculative.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionAnd where would that put you in terms of market share in storage at that point? Would that have the --most of the market in stationary storage in 2017?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWe don't really know.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell, I mean the market is definitely growing very quickly. So it's a bit hard...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerI'd say we're speculating on what the actual entire market is going to do and how that's going to grow. Sothat's...Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI don't think you can draw a lot of conclusions from like what is the market -- how many -- how much ofthe stationary storage was sold last year. Just as the beginning of electric car production for Tesla, peoplewere trying to say, \"Well, how many electric cars have been sold -- were sold last year? Almost none.Therefore, Tesla will sell almost none.\" That's to summarize what the vast majority of predictions wereabout the Model S.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, the prices that stationary storage was selling at last year, for instance, are so much higher than wherethey would be -- they will be in 2017 that you can't extrapolate those 2.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, and that amount for stationary storage increases at a sort of quite an extreme exponential as the costof -- the cost similarity decreases. The mutual issues in things -- like things in terms of levelized cost ofenergy. And that depending upon where you are in the world, that number, in some places, is very high;in some places, it's quite low. But as you start to approach the average value, the demand basically scalesinto tera -- multi-terawatt-hour range. So...Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, I mean grid parity is kind of the wrong concept here, but it's maybe a somewhat of an analogy tothink about.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectAnd grid parity, the market is staggeringly gigantic.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionAnd what is your all-in cost? I know it's $250 for the Powerpack. I mean, with installation or anything, doyou have any estimate of what it actually cost like a commercial utility, all-in?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerWell it depends a lot on the scope and scale and how many other pieces that installation are bundledtogether. So we haven't quoted or listed those numbers since they vary so much from one installation tothe next. The battery cost is really what matters most in the economics, so that's where we've listed thoseprices.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionI mean any sense of the high-end, low-end range for an installation?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerNothing that we'd be ready to share quite yet.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionOkay. And then last question. How should we think about the margin profile over the next few years asthis ramps? I believe you said Q4 is pretty low. Should that meaningfully improve? And when can you kindof get parity with your gross margin in the auto side?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWe are getting quite speculative about the battery business, but -- Yes, I mean in the early days, thebattery gross margins sort of on the order of 15% but over time, that could rise to 25% or maybe 30%.But we just don't know that quite yet. We'd have to look at what the price elasticity of demand is tounderstood to where should we be pricing and what's the right gross margin to aim for."

        "paragraph": "Our next question on queue comes from Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird.Benjamin Joseph KalloRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionAs far as the Model X goes, last time, Elon, you talked about configuration in July, and I understandwith the slippage. But when can we start thinking about configuring cars if we have orders out there,customers have orders? And then with about a month away from deliveries, when do you expect to showit to people?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWe're probably into upper configuration in 2 or 3 weeks of the X. So that should go live on the websitebefore the end of the month. In terms of the initial deliveries of the X, that's consistent with what we'vepredicted on the last call, which is end of September.Benjamin Joseph KalloRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionOkay. And then as we look out to the target of 500,000 cars in 2020 and you have some of the things thatyou've learned recently, do you still stand behind that number? And what gives you confidence in lookingahead to that number and ramping up production?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectSure. I do remain confident about 0.5 million cars in 2020 and maybe being able to exceed that. It's worthnoting that -- so 2020, that's 5 years from now. If you go 5 years in the past for Tesla, we were producing600 cars per year. Now we can produce 600 cars in 3 days. So I think going from here to -- from here to500,000 cars a year is a much smaller leap than what we did over the past 5 years.Benjamin Joseph KalloRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionGot it. And then when we think about your currency exposure, are you guys -- where are you guys atin thinking about moving kind of manufacturing outside of the U.S? Or any parts of manufacturing? Oradditional manufacturing?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, it depends on what time frame. In the next few years, we expect to be focused on Fremont andthe Gigafactory in Nevada. Long term -- again we're getting very speculative here. But in the 3- to 5-year time frame, it's going to make sense for us to think about localizing production in different markets,having a factory in Asia, a factory in Europe, other factories in North America. So in order to go beyondthe 500,000 units a year, that's what we need to do. Our Tesla factory in Fremont and in Reno is -- thatsort of size for the 500k level. Might be able to a little bit more than that, but let's say, 500k should be-- we're very achievable. The NUMMI factory -- when it was operating as NUMMI, it would do roughly 0.5million vehicles a year. So for us to do a similar number is just quite reasonable, I think, without addingnew factories. So the new factories would be for going past 0.5 million.Benjamin Joseph KalloRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionAnd my final question, headline after this call might be Tesla is going to raise capital. Just from yourcomments, I think that some people are going to walk away thinking that. And I just want to make surethat you guys can set the record straight if that's in the cards in the near term, or if it's not?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWe can't comment on that specifically. So all right, next question."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Andrea James with Dougherty & Company.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionWhat have you learned or discovered between the time when you set that 55,000-unit goal and I guessnow, when you're saying it's better to have some more breathing room on the ramp? And also, I guessone more just along with that, is there any supplier in particular that's concerning you?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectI mean, I sort of -- I don't want to sort of name specific suppliers. But our biggest challenges are with thesecond row seat. It's an amazing seat, like a sculptural work of art, but a very tricky thing to get right.The falcon wing door actually seems to probably not be the -- not be a critical-path item. There are someinterior components, interior trim that are -- possibly on a critical path. So it's very hard to say exactlywhat lies in the critical path because it tends -- these things tend to play a scheduled leapfrog. And it'skind of a set of constraints that one day, it's this constraint, then the next day, it's another constraint. Andthe pace of progress is really dependent on which supplier is the slowest and least lucky. So if a supplierhas unexpected challenges, which can range from force majeure to somebody having to redo a designbecause the initial design was wrong. When you have a complex product like Model S with thousands of-- that's dependent on thousands of suppliers, you can say that the pace of progress is determined by thethousandth least lucky and slowest. But if we knew in advance which ones of those would be, we wouldtake action. So the -- yes, it's...Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionNo, that's helpful. I think everybody understands that your -- an investment in Tesla is a company that'slearning as it goes along. So it's interesting to see what you're discovering as you attempt to build. Theother thing, can you walk us through what you accomplished during the factory shutdown in the quarter?It looks like you really did a lot of work in 1 week. Can help us understand the significance, and then alsomaybe paint it in terms what you're doing in the factory this year that's going to actually be repurposed orcan even be used toward Model 3 production.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes, so the retooling was both for the X as well as for improved efficiency of S production. And I think wegot a lot accomplished there. For Model 3, the biggest single item is the paint shop. So the paint shop issized to be able to do 10,000 cars a week. So we've laid the foundations for that rate in the paint shop.And I think there's also room for significant increases in our foundry in terms of casting. And we've alsomade a significant investment in stamping and some sort of advanced metal sheet forming technologythat isn't stamping. Yes, and J.B., you want to add to that?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerI think in plastics and paint, especially paint, we made modifications there on the existing paint shop aswe're getting the new one ready. I think we essentially added capacity in many different shops aheadof Model X, which required some production interruption to do it right, including getting our productioncontrol and inventory management processes much better. And you just can't do that when production isrunning.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionWhat about the drive unit, investments in the drive unit manufacturing? Is any of that small drive unitgoing to be used for Model 3? Or it seems like you're really scaling up there.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWe certainly learned a great deal going from the original Model S drive unit to the small drive unit, what'scalled the small drive unit. It's dramatically easier to mould. It's much more automated. That said, I thinkwe would -- we will do a further revision for the Model 3 and essentially go to third generation productiontechnology for the Model 3.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. Maybe one thing to keep in mind is the small drive unit, capacity is quite in excess, even of vehicles,because of all-wheel drive. And as that has ticked up, we've increased the capacity of the small drive unitin production that you see as well.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionBecause you need 2 of them?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectYes.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionAnd then finally, I guess, Deepak, I'd love for you to stay for as long as possible, but I'll just ask thisanyway. What's the status of your CFO search?Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWe're interviewing candidates all the time. Deepak is part of the interview process. And yes, I think we're-- we're out talking to some interesting candidates. I'm not sure if there's anything more to say aboutthat.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerNo, I mean, clearly, I'll stay around to ensure there's a smooth transition and we're continuing to talk tolots of candidates and make sure we find the right person to come in.Andrea Susan JamesDougherty & Company LLC, Research DivisionOkay. Actually, do you have any progress on regional heads of sales? And then that's my last one.Elon R. MuskCo-Founder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Product ArchitectWell, we do have a regional head of sales for Asia. He came to us from EMV. And then there was somepress about our head of North American sales who came from Burberry and then -- just because we havelike one person from Burberry then people think we're copying Apple, which is ridiculous. He is great butjust one guy. And then we're continuing to search for our head of Europe sales."

I mean, I think if you just look at ourcomments in the past, what we've said is like we're really excited to see other car companies do electricvehicle programs. What's been done to date is not much. They have generally been fairly small programsand often just set to achieve a regulatory minimum. So that hasn't been great thus far, but I amencouraged by what I see about their future plans. They sound like they're headed in the right direction.And I would be super happy to see the whole industry go electric. And we have open-sourced our patentso those wouldn't be an impediment and but perhaps could be helpful. And yes, it'd be really great if thewhole industry would just go electric as soon as possible. In fact -- I mean, our view is that the wholeindustry will go electric eventually, they really won't have much choice. But the sooner they go electric,the better.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsOkay. I think that was the last question in the queue.
