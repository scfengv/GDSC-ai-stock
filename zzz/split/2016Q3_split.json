I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Jeff Evanson. Sir, you may begin.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsThank you, Chanel, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Tesla's Third Quarter 2016 Q&A Webcast.I'm joined today by Elon Musk, J.B. Straubel, Jason Wheeler and Jon McNeill. Our Q3 results areannounced in the update letter at the same link as this webcast.And during our call today, we will make -- we'll discuss our business outlook and make forward-lookingstatements. These are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or resultscould differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our mostrecent filings with the SEC.We will start today's call with some brief comments by Elon and Jason, followed by your questions andanswers. And, Elon, I'll pass it over to you.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderAll right, thank you. My comments will be brief because I think it's really what I would have to say iscaptured in the earnings letter. But obviously, the main thing is that we're able to have our best quarterever, achieve full GAAP profitability, and moreover, I think we are headed to have a great fourth quarter aswell.One of the criticisms I've seen out there is that perhaps Q3 was late kind of expense in Q4. This is nottrue. And we currently believe that Q4 will be profitable, excluding noncash stock-based expenses. I thinkthere's actually a chance that we will be -- there's a chance that we'll be profitable even including noncashstock-based expenses. It's just a chance. I would -- it's not a promise but I think we've got a shot atactually being profitable even taking stock-based expense, et cetera. But -- so it's very exciting. And Ithink I'm very proud of the Tesla team for executing so well on Q3 and going into Q4 and beyond.So yes, it's been great, definitely one of the best moments ever in Tesla, I think. Jason?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerCool. Thanks, Elon. Just a couple of points I want to hit on real quickly before we jump into Q&A. One is Ijust want to point out the prudent financial management that we've been able to accomplish over the lastseveral quarters. An example here is back in 2015, we were spending $400 million a quarter on CapEx.We've averaged about $250 million a quarter in 2016. That will change as Model 3 starts to ramp up inQ4, but we are focusing on making sure that every dollar we spend is in its highest and best use.From a gross margin perspective, if you look at automotive gross margin, and it excludes credit revenue,we had a 140 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter. Lots of different factors there: one,obviously, the increase in volume helps on the labor and overhead front; second, our reliability continuesto get better and better; a big change in Model X, over the last 12 months, as we highlighted in the letter;and continued improvements in batteries and drive units across both vehicles. Another source of grossmargin improvement is the prior sourcing and the wind-down of our commitments on prototype parts forModel X.Third point on financial management. You can see our OpEx is growing sublinear to revenue. Theoperating leverage that we've been talking about through the course of the year is starting to kick in. Toput some real numbers around that, GAAP revenue was up 81% quarter-over-quarter, 145% year-over-year and yet GAAP OpEx was only up 7% quarter-over-quarter compared to 3% year-over-year.The second thing I want to talk for just a couple of minutes about is what we've done to the capitalstructure and our sources of liquidity. As you may have read in the letter, we paid down $600 million indebt within the quarter, most notably, $422 million of conversions on our 2018 converts, derisking thebalance sheet in the future. In addition to that, we were able to sign a $300 million warehouse line, whichgives us more leasing capacity at great terms. The terms on that vehicle are less than 2%.Also, we managed to get an 80% increase with our largest North America leasing partner in the quarter,and we're also on task to sign up a new leasing partner in Q4.So generally, I'd just like to point out that our access to capital markets and our sources of liquidity is asstrong as it's ever been.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, in fact just to highlight one comment of what Jason is saying, our vehicle gross margin increased Q2to Q3. One of the other things I've seen out there is that like somehow we achieved these numbers as aresult of widespread discounting. That is absolutely false. The discounts -- there were a few discounts that-- but they were few and far between, and that has been absolutely shut down to 0. So you can see thatin the fact that the vehicle profitability increased, even excluding ZEV credits from Q2 to Q3.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsAll right. Chanel, I think we're ready for the first question."

        "paragraph": "And our first question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionI mean, it looks like a very strong free cash flow quarter but when I look through the balance sheet, thereseems to be a pretty large increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities that seems to have helped.How should we think about that going into Q4? Does some of that unwind? Were there any changes tohigher terms in the quarter? Or is that just this thing with the ramp in production?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure, yes. Great questions, Jason. So yes, there was definitely an increase in payables and I think that willstart to unwind a little bit in Q4, although this is natural. If you look at production, I believe it increased37% quarter-over-quarter so there's naturally going to be more parts coming into the factory. So I thinksome of that is just in the course of business. And the other thing that I think is worth pointing out on thecash flow statement is receivables. We had a lot of deliveries right at the end of the quarter, so we weren'table to [indiscernible] all of our receivables. We ended up with a fairly large receivable balance on carsthat were delivered in the last 10 days or so.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, definitely. Also yes, with emphasizing that, I mean, it's the first approximation you expect, payablesto increase by 37% if you -- production does -- and then you have to net out against receivables. Andwhen you do that, I think it's not really -- not a material situation.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes. And we are actively looking to increase terms with suppliers. And I think as our production has beenmore predictable, our suppliers have been much more open to that conversation.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, in fact -- yes, thanks for making that point, Jason. I think it's worth emphasizing that for Model 3, butthe Model 3 system is designed -- the whole manufacturing supply chain system is designed so that thefaster Model 3 production grows, the faster Tesla's cash balance grows. So the terms that we're gettingfrom suppliers are significantly better, almost 60 days, as compared to about 40 to 45 days for S and X.And the Model 3 production and logistics is way faster, so the car spends much less time in the factoryand we're working on ways to expedite delivery of the vehicles to suit the end customer, which we cando when we have scale. We don't have to just wait for a ship to go somewhere. We can pull up the wholeship and just have the ship go whenever we want. So the net effect is that instead of growth in a capitalconsumer, growth is a capital producer. It's quite fundamental.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionGot it. And so the other question I had is you're guiding to profit in Q4 without ZEV credits, and actually,it sounds like without even the stock comp possibly, yet production's about flat. Model X is going to geta little worse. OpEx guidance sort of implies that's up sequentially. So what are the key drivers that areactually going to get you to profitability if -- I think, if you take out the ZEV credit, there would haveprobably been still a loss in this quarter.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, we expect gross margin to increase. And, I mean, that's a huge factor. For some points that we[indiscernible] before, but like we're using very few prototype parts or growth of the low volume sellingparts and we're not paying for the craziness of expediting and there are a bunch of design improvements,design cost down so that actually even a value-neutral to the customer is actually going to cost slightlybetter. And we have the P100. So one of the things that the 100-kilowatt hour car, or pack, was only inlimited production towards the end of last quarter, and it will be in pretty significant portion of the mix thisquarter. So yes, yes.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceI think one additional thing is the reliability of the cars continues to get better so our warranty costs aredecreasing as well and that's a really -- that's a key driver for us not only from the cost side but from thedemand side, where we're referring demand in market, given the reliability of the vehicles.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, I mean, the reliability improvement is massive.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceIt is. So the visits to service for Model X through the course of the year have declined 92%, which is justa fantastic result both from the manufacturing side, and the vehicle reliability teams have been workinghard to achieve that and we're going to continue to improve against that.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsAll right. Chanel, let's go to the next question, please."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionJust want to go in a little bit on the regulatory credits. A couple of things. First, clearly with your deliverynumbers, the California and the other CARB states are buying more Teslas. Yet last quarter, you talkedabout the value of those plummeting and we shouldn't really expect much. So kind of, obviously, you'regenerating more but a couple of questions. What's happened in the marketplace for those credits? AndI know even under GAAP, you don't list that as a balance sheet asset, but if we were to think about thequarterly generation of credits as well as the credits on your -- in effect in your car bank that could bemonetized in the future, how would we think about those?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderUnfortunately, as I said on record before, the CARB, their credit mandate is incredibly weak and needs tobe fixed. And when you have a weak mandate, obviously, the value of those credits decline conservatively.There are some quarters where we simply cannot even find a buyer for credit. And then when we can finda buyer, it's typically $0.50 on the $1 for those who have credit. So -- and then obviously, their creditonly applied to, what, roughly half of our market in the U.S., maybe slightly above half, and it doesn'tapply to Asia or Europe or Canada or Mexico or anywhere else. So it's there. It's -- I think CARB reallyshould be doing more. It's unfortunate that they're not. And then I need to sort of move right along ablog piece that's sort of going through this. But that Tesla's sometimes criticized for relying on tax creditsand that kind of thing. People really misunderstand this. What matters is what does Tesla receive relativeto its competitors, not what -- that we receive in the absolute. For our competitors, it may be worthnoting, maybe you would consider us to be a risk or something that is problematic for us. Our competitorsmonetize ZEV credits at 100 cents on the dollar. We monetize them at 50 cents on the dollar where wecould get it. That means if you have, let's say, -- I mean it depends on the scenario, but if you have, let'ssay, 3 ZEV credits for an EV that would essentially be worth $5,000 each, so that would be $15,000. Sowhen, say, Jim or somebody sells an AV, they get $15,000. But when Tesla sells an EV, we get half that.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionRight, they have an internal marketing\u2026Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIt's not me who are being subsidized but our competitors. Now, an interesting thing is there is a limit toour disadvantage because of them credit thing is so weak, it only goes so far, it only applies to certainstates. So what you will see our competitors do is they will limit their production and they will only sellinto those states or almost entirely in those states. That doesn't scale. That will take them to maybe40,000 or 50,000 units a year best case but not -- but we're talking about doing 500,000 units a year,which means at high volume, we no longer suffer the disadvantage of a big credit regime. It's whollymisunderstood.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsThat help, Brian?Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionAnd was there --Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderBetter strength [indiscernible].Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionYes, and just a quick follow-up on GHG credits. Were there any?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSay again, Brian?Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionJust a follow-up. Were there the Z -- GHG or other Cap A credit and how did they compare to priorquarters?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThose are mouse nuts."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line from Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer.Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionCan we just look at the shipment numbers? So a quarter ago, you were guiding to roughly 80,000vehicles. A year and now 3 months later, we're down at 75,000. Can you just walk us through the factorsthat are impacting that lower shipment number, or delivery number, I should say.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, I think this has really gone over the last quarter's call, is that we had problems getting to rate in thefirst half of the year, rate being an average of roughly 2,000 cars a week. Just a lot of things broken inour production system. I personally probably took a year off my life or more camping out of the freakingfactories solving that along with a number of other members of the Tesla team, went through a bloodyh*** in first half of this year. We got out of that basically around mid-June and then the result is achievinga weekly production target of roughly 2,000 cars a week.Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionOkay. Maybe I can take that off-line. So then the second question for me is really about absorption. Withnearly 40% increase in deliveries, can you guys break out the impact in gross margin to absorption? Itwould seem that, that would be a meaningful number at this point.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWhat are you talking about?Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionFactory absorption.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerLike, do you mean like fixed cost versus...Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionYes, fixed cost on the factory and how that flows through the depreciation line.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerSure. I mean, the way to think about that is I think Elon actually just covered it in his last answer. We hadcapacitized the factory and had the factory to actually produce much more -- many more cars in the firsthalf of the year and we fell short of that. And now we're at the rate that we had planned to be at early inthe year. So our absorption is about where we'd expect it to be. And I think what you're seeing now froman absorption perspective as it's related to gross margin is a good steady state rate.Colin William RuschOppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research DivisionOkay, I was just looking for a quarter-over-quarter number in terms of the contribution margin.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerWe typically don't break down all the different factors within gross margin."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionCan you talk about the drivers of the substantially less-than-expected capital expenditures in the quarterand the reduction to the full year CapEx guide? Should we think about this as being more about the push-out or delay of certain activities that give rise to CapEx? Or is it more that you're on schedule with thoseactivities but doing them in a thriftier way or some sort of combination of these factors?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderOne of the things that what we've found is way better with the 3 program than X and S is that ourequipment suppliers are willing to work with us on payment terms and we're being able to back-end load.And in fact, post-production load, a huge amount of the CapEx. So that just stood up a lot better than weexpected. But we've not taken any action that would cause the Model 3 time line to be extended in anyway. We're quite confident of reaching volume production in the second half of next year.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes. If I might chime into that a tiny bit as well. We also are continuing to improve the capital efficiencyper unit of the production lines. And especially over the last few months, we've put a huge amount ofengineering attention into really focusing on that problem, and we're seeing results. And I think we'llcontinue to see incremental improvements all the way from things like the battery cells all the way up tothe vehicle itself.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOkay. And then the follow-up to that is just in regards to the amended S-4 that you filed a couple of weeksback. There was some changed language in there from Tesla's currently planning to raise additional fundsby the end of the year to you're now stating that you expect adequate liquidity through at least the end ofthe year, I think it says. So what was the primary change would you say? Does it relate to this CapEx issuethat we're talking about here or to higher earnings or to another factor?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, I think it covers all of the above. So we've gotten really good at capital efficiency. And J.B., whowas just speaking, has done a great job of that up at the Gigafactory in particular. And I think we're justexecuting very well. We met our internal targets for Q3 so -- and you see what happened on the cash flowstatement. So I think it's operational execution as well as capital efficiency.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderOne thing that's worth mentioning and certainly, I would take this with a grain of salt and not like it's a-- like sometimes I'll say things which I think are sort of speculation or my best guess but they're not --it's different from a promise. Our current plan, our current financial plan does not require any capital raisefor Model 3 at all. So now that's different from saying whether we should raise capital or not to accountfor uncertainty, to have a larger buffer and to sort of derisk the business. So -- and then we also feelpretty good having examined the SolarCity financials that it looks like SolarCity will actually be at leastneutral, but perhaps a cash contributor in the fourth quarter in a small way. But again, let's not take thisto the bank. It's not a promise. This is like -- this is what appears to be the case. So contingent uponshareholder approval, we expect SolarCity to be somewhere between neutral and cash contributor inthe fourth quarter. And yes, I mean, things are looking good. Yes. It's not to say that there'll be somedarkness ahead but they look really quite good right now. It seems like we probably won't need to capitalraise even in Q1. I'm not saying we won't, but probably not. And yes, just overall really, things are lookingquite promising.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes. And the other thing I would just add on top of that is just go back to some of the comments I madeat the beginning of the call about our others versus liquidity. I mean the capital markets are up open tous and as our asset base grows, our ability to monetize those assets kind of increases. We've got our ABLline. We've got the $300 million warehouse line. So we've got the things and we've also been able to lineup a bunch of incremental capacity on the leasing side during the course of the quarter as well, so that'sdefinitely a piece of it."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA.Emmanuel RosnerCLSA Limited, Research DivisionI have a couple of questions on your recent announcement around the autonomous driving. So I guess,the first one is on hardware and then the second one on the software. On hardware, it seems like -- atleast from the outside where we're sitting, it seems like just recently, you were indicating you will bedeemphasizing the vision approach to aid us in autonomous driving. And now it seems the latest hardwareseems largely based on vision. So I was curious how -- what was the thought process there? And stillwithin hardware, how do you acquire confidence that the hardware you're putting in cars today would stillbe adequate to take you all the way to full autonomy when it's only based -- I mean, largely based onvision?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, first of all, I would separate what Tesla says from, say, some supplier of ours issuing bulls***,okay. The blog that I wrote was very clear that radar is moving from a supplemental to also a primarysensor. It's not to the exclusion of vision but it's also a primary sensor. Vision is still the main thing. Butradar, instead of merely being like a crosscheck against vision, is really, when done well, and we're veryconfident at this point that it can be done this way, can be a primary sense as such that you can takeactions based on radar information alone. You can also take actions based on just vision alone. Much asa person might take action based on whether you hear something or you see something, you don't needto both hear it and see it. Yes, so there's no -- I would feel highly confident that a camera solution with12 ultrasonics and a forward radar and the computing power that we now have on board is capable offull autonomy at a -- is significantly greater than even -- there are obviously skeptics out there, well, Isuggest that they do not bet against this.Emmanuel RosnerCLSA Limited, Research DivisionOkay. And then on the software side, I guess a lot of the players involved in developing autonomoussolutions seem to think that a big input for autonomous driving, especially higher levels of autonomy,sort of a map, a live updated map, what are -- there was not a lot of new information on the most recentannouncement on this. What are Tesla's plans for this part of the solution?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYou mean...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI think we're getting into like technical questions that are not really related to this quarter, so we'll have topass.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsYes, stay tuned for product announcements as they come out."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionJust a somewhat of a redundant follow-up question here but I really just want to make sure I get thisright. I mean, as you're looking at R&D and CapEx, I mean those are 2 items that as we're looking at avery significant product launch next year or kind of running at very, very low levels. I'm just curious, asyou're talking about this, do you think that -- well that -- I mean, no, they're not that low but I meanrelative to what we would expect on a product -- ahead of a product launch, do you think that R&D atabsolute levels can stay here and support the Model 3 launch and everything else you're working on orwill that need to go up? And then also similarly, I mean, this CapEx number of $1 billion-plus in the fourthquarter really is a significant step-up. I mean is that really just too high a number and you guys really arerunning significantly lower than this $2.25 billion, lower than $1.8 billion, maybe something significantlylower and really finding a massive amount of efficiency here? And I'm just really trying to understand whatthese levels are going to be because they are very impressive to date.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, sure. I can take the R&D piece. I imagine that R&D will continue to go up.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderBut not like -- not in giant ways.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerNot in giant ways, yes.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderModerate increases in R&D to the extent that they're not some big, sort of, step-change.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes. Yes, exactly. And on the SG&A side, that's where we're really finding our operating leverage. On thecapital front, again, I think there's just continued opportunities for us to optimize this. There's a wholenew kind of paradigm of thinking that we're going through. And it's breaking through conventional normssuch as to add a step change in capacity, you have to have -- add a step change in capital. That's not true.You can always optimize things. You can make things move faster. It can be more efficient. You can usefloor space better, so I think it's some of this thinking which Elon has talked about a lot about that's reallygetting baked into our capital plan.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I mean, maybe it seems low relative to the traditional industry, but I guess if we're comparing towhat we've done in our past and even if we just look at the...Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceYes, it looks like a lot of money to us.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. The S program was actually quite a lot lower R&D and lower CapEx than this. So it feels like a hugeamount of money.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionBut I mean you guys really are running at a run rate that is half of what you -- or less than half of whatyou're originally talking about for the year on a run rate basis. And I'm just trying to understand if that'ssomething that is more realistic or we should expect a real big step-up in the fourth quarter.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerIf you go back to actually our guidance at the beginning of the year on the OpEx side, I believe our initialguidance was 25% year-over-year, and we bumped that up to 30% year-over-year. So there is...John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionI'm sorry, I meant on CapEx.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerOn CapEx, our original guidance at the beginning of the year was $1.5 billion. And then when we madethe initial announcement to bring forward production of 500,000 vehicles into 2018, then we bumped itup. And I think now we're just getting smarter about that. And that's why we brought that guidance backdown in the letter this quarter.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. So we're probably just too conservative on our capital projections. It turned out to be we can do thiswith less capital than anticipated.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionGot it. And just one follow-up on mix. I mean, these 100 kilowatt-hour models, I mean, it sounds like insome ways, you may have underestimated the high end of the market, which is a good thing. I mean, aswe think about that as a percent of mix going forward, I mean, do you really think there's a tremendousopportunity for that to be a material part of the mix?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. It's one of my -- I mean, right now, there are like 3 things that I -- probably that are top priorities forme. Obviously, Model 3 achieving -- rate of schedule on Model 3 -- rate of schedule on constant Model 3is top. Then it's advancing to Autopilot software, that Autopilot self-driving software. And then it's the 100kilowatt-hour, kind of, ramp up the 100 kilowatt-hour production rate. I receive daily updates on the 100kilowatt-hour production. After this call, I'm probably going to be on the 100 kilowatt-hour production linebecause the demand is high and it's -- we just need to satisfy that demand.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionOkay. It just seems like that almost might be more important as far as profitability and cash flow in thenear term than the Model 3. Just because...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, definitely in the near term. I mean it's a 100% fitment [ph].John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionBut even over time, but, okay.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Yes, it's a serial big deal. 7 days a week, I get an update on the 100 kilowatt-hour progress on theproduction ramp for that."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of Ben Kallo of Baird.Benjamin Joseph KalloRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionElon, if I could ask a question about SolarCity. One of the things that I cover is SolarCity and you guysbought Silevo, my initial reaction was to be negative on it. And one of the things I'm worried about withthe transaction if you guys acquired them or merging is the Buffalo deal, I mean it just being a cash cow.And so I was relieved when I saw Panasonic step in. Can you talk any more about that? And then maybein the same question, how I saw this, the slide deck yesterday about how their business model is changingfrom lease to more cash sales or loan sales. What do you expect going forward and maybe that's Jason,from a cash flow basis? I know you said Q4 relates to that but can this be cash accretive to the businessnext year? Then I have 1 follow-up.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI think I expect SolarCity to be approximately cash neutral, all things considered next year, yes. It doesdepend on how fast we ramp upproduction in Buffalo. And by the way, I think first in your question, you said \"cash cow.\" I think youmaybe meant to say cash back here. But we do it -- no question, that's what I'm saying it is. But the --we do think it's important to have tight control over the production of the solar panels in order to really-- in order to have a beautiful solar roof product, we've got to be able to iterate rapidly and have themmade exactly the way we want them, so that you have very high-efficiency cells at the lowest cost, that'sour objective. Just as we've been able to achieve that in partnership with Panasonic on the battery front.We have the best cell at the lowest price. That's a really good place to be. And we are confident we canachieve that same outcome in solar. And while also creating a solar roof product that is better than anormal roof, looks better than a normal roof. Now, the market also bifurcated, as I mentioned before.There's like -- if somebody's just installed a roof and if the house is new, it's not going to make sense forthem to go reroof the house. It makes more sense to have something that's solar panels are added to theroof. But for someone that is building a house or where the roof is nearing its expiry date, then the solarroof is the right option. So the nice thing is you don't really cannibalize one or the -- one from the other.They're 2 separate markets. And so the -- I think we're quite pleasantly surprised by it what we debut onFriday. It's exceeded my expectations. And yes, I don't want to jump the gun on that. You should reallysee what we unveil on Friday. I think it's really great.Benjamin Joseph KalloRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionAnd then one more maybe big picture and probably get made fun of this for asking. But stakeholders,I watch what the work you're doing with SpaceX, and you have this statement you said about thereason you want to make money is for your work on interplanetary transport. How do you judge a Teslashareholder versus a Tesla car owner? How do you delineate between where you give value versus thedifferent stakeholders and the whole group there?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI don't really think about it like that. It's really just, we want to make products that people love and thenmake enough money out from that to be able to develop new products. And that's it really. It's just --there's like so few products, like how many parts in your body you really love? So rare. And I think to dosomething like that, people will buy them, they'll pay a premium for some things they love, of course.Yes, and then I think it ends up being a good outcome for shareholders, because the whole focus of anycompany existing is to make compelling products and services. Some of these people lose sight of whycompanies should even exist.Benjamin Joseph KalloRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionLike so, for example, would you scale back the growth of SolarCity, even though it's the greater good forthe environment, to be more cash flow positive, I guess, is a good way to look at it.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI don't think -- we have to look at this in the long term. And if SolarCity's moving lots of money, thenthat's not good for long term, but investors will not support such a situation. So I think there may besome intermediate slowdowns, but this is actually with an eye towards ultimately moving way faster."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of James Albertine of Consumer Edge.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCI wanted to ask a question, if I may, on battery cost and particularly, just kind of update on theGigafactory and the impact of the Gigafactory on battery cost. It seems as we're getting closer to theopening, that while there is some improvement sort of going on in the background in terms of efficienciesof the battery cell production process, and also, with the trade secrets that you're working on betweengeneration-to-generation of cell production, that at least 30% benefit from the Gigafactory, how shouldthat filter into the model, let's say, over the course of the next kind of 6 to 8 months between now andmaybe when you start to talk more about Model 3 production?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerWell, I'm not sure we want to give a detailed glide slope on this, but we're still very confident on theprogress against the milestones we talked about previously. We're still confident that we'll have the very-- the best cell cost in the world when we start production. And I think those are really the most importantmetrics. And long term, we see ongoing opportunities to keep driving that down as we add innovation intothe manufacturing process and keep increasing scale.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCAnd just to confirm when you're still expecting to sort of begin production on the Gigafactory itself.And then just a quick product question, as it relates to what you've done with the Model S and the 100kilowatt-hour battery pack. Thinking about a fully loaded optimized Model 3, which obviously is smallervehicle, is there a potential to see range? Again, this is not a price-sensitive question, but at the high endof the Model 3 side, is there potential to see range extend significantly further than what we're seeing withthe S and X?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerWell, maybe to your first question, I mean, we're still generally on track as we stated with the Gigafactoryschedule and production. There's equipment being installed and being commissioned as we speak. There'sa fairly extensive process of bringing that equipment online, starting up pilot production, validating thepilot production. So I mean, that's exactly what we're in the middle of and continuing to ramp up throughthe end of this year. So we feel good about where that's at, and we feel that we're definitely on schedulefor production for Model 3."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionJust one question about the Autopilot software development. As you guys are putting the hardware andthe software and learning capabilities in the entire fleet of incremental production, you're going to havelots of -- lots and lots of very rich data that is going to be brought to you for analysis and processingand learning. And I guess, the question is when, Elon, would you say would be the earliest reasonableopportunity for you and perhaps backed by the scientific community and your own community in yourcompany to make the case, make a strong case to the regulators with the empirical data as you getand analyze it at the safety of the vehicles, even if not in a fully autonomous application but even in thesemiautonomous so that you can bring more visibility and transparency to the urgent need to address thespiraling deaths and injury on our roads?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, well, I should say we do work actually very closely on a daily basis and have for a long time withNHTSA and other regulatory agencies around the world, so really at a very detailed level. So -- but they'recertainly aware of kind of with nitty-gritty, and as I've said before, it's -- we already see a significantimprovement in safety with the semiautonomous features. And what sort of lessons we'll see outside isROE, the cases where the Autopilot actually did a lot to mitigate the accident. So that the impact velocitywas -- went from being potentially fatal or severe injury to customer stepped out and walked away. Thereare many of those which provides a much more statistically significant sample set then fatalities becausefatalities are extremely rare. And you need really 1 billion miles or more to try to achieve a statisticallysignificant conclusion on fatalities. So -- but as our fleet grows, and it's growing rapidly, the number ofsemiautonomous miles grows, to the point where I think we're now trying to punch 1.5 million, almost 1.5million miles per day of Autopilot in all kinds of work conditions and weather and -- throughout the world.So -- and the more time that goes by, the more miles we accumulate, the stronger the argument getsabout the confidence interval tighten, and it becomes clearer and clearer. So I'm really quite optimisticabout where things are and where they're headed on that front. I think they're headed to a good place."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne of Cowen and Company.Jeffrey David OsborneCowen and Company, LLC, Research DivisionJust 2 questions on my end. One, how do we think about the cadence of CapEx in '17? Should it persistat a continued rate in the first half of '17 up until the Model 3 launch at a similar run rate as you're seeinghere in Q4? Or what's the thought process there?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI mean you will see a ramp up in Q2 -- in Q1 and Q2, as you would expect, as we get closer to production.And then a lot of the payments come after our start of productions in Q3, Q4. And there'll be obviouslyextensions on new vehicle development. So you can expect it to ramp up a fair bit over time. But I standby what I said earlier, which is currently, if we did not go out and raise a bunch of money, our current plansays we don't need to raise any money. It gets a little scary in terms of how much capital we owe the bankrelative to our sales volume, but it does -- currently, raise capital, it's something that's a nice to have nota necessity. And maybe it's a smart move to derisk things in a way. So just looking at the bigger picture,taking into account also that we're designing the 3 program to be a cash generator, that the paths of the3 grows that will stronger our cash position. I don't think you need to worry too much about CapEx beinglike a dilutive event or something like that.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, and just so it's clear, Elon's talking about the step-up from our Q3 levels, not a step-up from Q4.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes.Jeffrey David OsborneCowen and Company, LLC, Research DivisionSo do you care to throw a number out there for CapEx for '17 at this point? Or do you think of it as kind offlattish but front-end loaded on '17 versus '16? Too early for that?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI heard '17 than '16, for sure, yes.Jeffrey David OsborneCowen and Company, LLC, Research DivisionAnd then around CapEx as well, any thoughts on kind of partner commitments to Gigafactory? What's thetrend there? And then also, I might have missed it, but what's the reservation count for Model 3 and therelease that was there?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI mean, we see very strong supplier commitments on Model 3. Yes, we don't see any deficit in supplycommitments there. They're very strong. This is the most interesting vehicle program, maybe the mostinteresting product program in the world. And so suppliers really want to be part of something like this.As for the 3 deposit number, this is not something we comment on and not something that is a figure ofmerit in any way. We do no promotion of Model 3. We don't advertise -- well, we don't have to advertise,in general, but we don't -- like, how often do you see me mentioning a Model 3? I think we almost mustn'tforget like that, that -- all we did for the Model 3 was have our webcast. There was no advertising, noguerilla marketing campaign, like send out a few tweets, like, \"Hey, there's going to be a webcast\". Andlike a lot of people decided they want to place a deposit for the car, which is cool. But we didn't want toget -- feel too distracted from today's product in favor of tomorrow's product. And then when somebodywent -- comes into our store to buy a Model 3, we say, \"Well, why don't you buy a Model S or an X,instead? So we anti-sell the 3. Still a lot of people -- still a lot of people order the 3, but whatever, that's-- plus the 3, like we're basically sold out the first year of production, so it fits well [ph] into production orthereabouts. So what's the point of trying to sell the 13th month in production with very little to be had --going to be had there in doing so."

        "paragraph": "And our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino of Goldman Sachs.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionJust want to circle back on a couple of things said earlier. First on the Autopilot, you mentioned that youwork very closely with NHTSA. I'm wondering what your take is on the push from the recent document,the federal autonomous vehicles policy (sic) [Federal Automated Vehicles Policy] that really is looking fordata sharing among OEMs. I think you're probably clearly in the lead with vehicles on the road and milesper day of data that you're aggregating. Wondering what your take is on potentially opening that up andsharing with some of your competitors.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWe'd be happy to share information with our competitors that would help improve safety; happy to do so.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionInteresting. Then the second one is really just on the cost side. You think about a traditional OEM and theirsupplier relationships. There's typically annual price downs, ranging in the 1% to 3% range, sometimesmore for more commoditized products, and you're very vertically integrated. I wonder how you thinkabout internal price downs and gaining economies of scale for the Model 3. And what you're really lookingto achieve from an operational efficiency standpoint on an annual basis with the parts that you have goinginto your vehicles.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderModel 3 efficiency as a whole, that really is a quantum change in productivity, like really, really crazy.I mentioned this before but as we go to high volume, what really matters is the factory, the machinethat designs the machine -- or the machine that creates the machine is -- comes actually of greatersignificance, much greater significance than the machine itself. That's what we have most of ourengineering team working on, so a sort of internal codename for the factory machine that builds themachine is the alien dreadnought. So the point at which our factory looks like an alien dreadnoughtthan we know, it's probably right. So we think with Model 3, we'll be alien dreadnought Version 0.5approximately. Then it'll take us about another year or so, I don't know, summer 2018 to actually get toalien dreadnought version 1.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionAnd I'm a little bit hazy on quantifying crazy. Is there any rule of thumb that you can point to with whatyou're looking to achieve at least in terms of bringing the cost down from a component level from the S tothe 3, not even thinking about the X, given the increasing complexity that was involved with the vehicle?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, it's rough approximation. We think it'll be about half. That's not like everything's half. Some thingsare way less than the half the cost and some things are more than half the cost, but on average, abouthalf.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionAnd predominantly internally sourced?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, depends on how you consider the value chain, but yes, I guess, arguably, it's majority internallysourced. But there's still a huge number of suppliers. The thing that happens when you -- once you startmaking almost all major subsystems internally, your supplier count actually grows dramatically; youhave far more suppliers, not far fewer. But as a -- but they're at the component level not at the majorsubsystem level.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, just the one thing I'd add to that too, regardless of what is sourced from the supplier, the wayto think about our cost and then just goes all the way back to first principles with the value, withcommodities in the part, whether they cost reasonably turn those commodities into a usable part withreasonable labor overhead, and that's how we think about all material cost decisions, internal or external.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, I mean, the long-term aspiration for the machine that builds the machine, the factory aliendreadnought thing, is the long-term aspiration is limited physics. I mean we call it like limited physicsmanufacturing."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets.Joseph Robert SpakRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research DivisionI wanted to ask a question on leasing. I know you pointed out that the percent of vehicles that are subjectto the RVG this period, I think declined by 4 points. And I don't know whether this was coincidental or not,but it looks like the direct lease percentage also went up by about 4 points. So as you dwindle down theRVGs, is -- are you planning that the ultimate lease rate is somewhere in that low to mid-30 range?Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerThere's a bunch of different levers here. So one that's worth pointing out and we haven't talked a lotabout is we've put out some very compelling loan products in the marketplace.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWorking with partners, yes.Jason S. WheelerFormer Chief Financial OfficerYes, different partners, yes. There are 2 partners. So of course, we always want to continue to do that,and we're always looking for ways where we can provide just compelling and useful financing programsfor our consumers, whether that's in a lease through a partner, whether that's a loan through a partner, orwhether we leverage our own balance sheet in the case of a direct lease, we'll do that too. Really it's aboutthe consumer experience. And if we can use other folks' capital for that, great. If we use our capital for it,that's fine too. We're willing to make those decisions.Joseph Robert SpakRBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research DivisionOkay. And then just back on autonomous, maybe to ask Adam's question a little bit different way. I know,Elon, you talked about a cross-country trip in '17. But in terms of turning on for the consumer, I think inthe past, you said you need about 6 billion miles traveled for regulatory approval. If I just do some crudemath based on your delivery, you've got time line that seems like, at some point in 2018, you'll get there,maybe it's a year or so later if you believe consensus deliveries. But if you put aside the regulatory issues,is that roughly the time frame you think it's ready for the consumer?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, I think the time frame that we think it's ready and then the time frame that regulators will approve,because we've got to present the data to them, they've got to think about it, then they've got to rendera verdict and that can sometimes be a long process. And it varies -- can vary quite a bit by jurisdiction. Ithink we may see some jurisdictions giving the okay a lot sooner than others. But when you think aboutlike the global average fatalities, it's sort of somewhere around 60 -- 1 fatality every 60 million miles ona global basis. So if you're at 6 billion miles, you're 100x the -- what the fatality is per mile. I mean, atthe -- like -- yes, so you really start to get quite statistically significant at that point, and can make quite astrong argument, I believe, at that point that it would be morally wrong not to allow autonomous driving.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsOkay. We're coming up on the hour mark. We have one other analyst on the call, and then we have somejournalists we definitely want to hear from as well.

There was a reference to the Tesla network and the ability to buy self-drivingtoday. So I wonder, Elon, if you could talk, maybe, philosophically about how you're viewing Tesla network.Is it something that will generate income for Tesla to help develop future products, et cetera, at areasonable gross margin? Or is it something that you'll use more for market share gain, help people offsetthe price of the car long term?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderAll right. Sorry, just sort of talking to [indiscernible] sitting there. I think it's a bit of both, really. Thiswould be something that would be a significant offset on the cost of ownership of a car and then a revenuegenerator for Tesla as well. Obviously, the majority of the economics would go to the owner of the car.Sometimes this has been characterized as Tesla versus Uber or Lyft or something like that. It's not Teslaversus Uber; it's the people versus Uber."

In Q2, you guys were saying that you're aiming for volume production towards the end of 2017,but now the letter is saying you're looking for volume deliveries in the second half of 2017. Am I justreading into this too much, or does that reflect a greater confidence on management's part or...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI think our confidence has been approximately the same. Obviously, as time goes by, there's some amountof the uncertainty is collapsed. And so, I guess, you could kind of call it confidence, but it's -- that'slooking good for production volume second half of 2017. As always, I really want to remind people thatcar is -- consists of several thousand unique items. We can only go as fast as the first item, and so whatwe're trying to do in advance of -- through production is to increase the scope of Tesla's internal capabilityso that we're internally capable of making almost anything and kind of like reserve troops. You don't knowexactly where they'll be needed, but you know it's a good idea to have them. And so that we can minimizethe degree which a single supplier can stop the entire production line.Daniel SparksOkay, great. And then as Model S and Model X, with higher levels of sales recently, higher levels ofdeliveries and as Model 3 approaches, do you feel confident in these levels as Model 3 approaches? Iknow that we haven't talked too much about 2017, but just kind of speaking as far as trajectory for thosedeliveries go and how we could think about it.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I mean, another thing I want to emphasize is when you -- the production ramp tends to look like a-- is exponential or ultimately, it's an S-curve. Exponential goes to linear, then goes to log. And it's verydifficult to predict exactly where that beginning part of the exponential and the S curve fits in betweenquarterly reporting. A shift of even a few weeks one way or the other can have quite a dramatic effect onwhat it looks like in that quarter, but that's not indicative of the future. So we're kind of telling you what-- what we -- we're giving you the best assessment we have short of having a crystal ball. I think thingswill look very good exiting 2017, but it'll be complicated and bumpy and dealing with a lot of unexpectedissues in the first -- in the beginning of Model 3 production in Q3, Q4 -- or Q3 particularly is very uncertainbecause it's the beginning of an exponential. It gets a bit more -- it gets a bit clearer in Q4, then starts tobe probably crisp and in the -- in the Q1, Q2 time frame of 2018."
