        "paragraph": "Our first question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.Alexander Eugene PotterPiper Jaffray Companies, Research DivisionThere's been a fair amount of debate recently, both amongst investors, I think, but also within the supplychain about the segments within the transportation ecosystem that will sort of forever be off-limits to Teslabecause of physical limitations of electric drivetrain, specifically as it relates to weight and energy densityand things of that nature. Presumably, you'd disagree, but I'd be interested in hearing maybe why youdisagree. Why you think Tesla can compete in those segments whereas other people think diesel or fuelcells or other options would be better?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderAre you thinking of things like heavy trucking?Alexander Eugene PotterPiper Jaffray Companies, Research DivisionFor instance, yes. That's -- I mean, I guess, different people draw the line in different areas, but as anexample, yes.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I mean I'm not sure -- I'm absolutely confident that the electric car trains will -- electric vehicleswill occupy everything without exception. And I don't want to jump the gun on the Tesla semi-truckannouncement we're unveiling later this year, but it's -- I think it's going to be a cool product and will defypeople's expectations on what an electric truck can do. So I really do not see any segment of transportthat will not be electric. In fact, I'm highly confident that all transport will go fully electric, with the ironicexception of rockets, yes. [ If you know your ] way around Newton's third law.Alexander Eugene PotterPiper Jaffray Companies, Research DivisionRight. Okay. And then I guess maybe one Model 3 question here. I know it's maybe early days, is there ina way to gauge sort of what you think the trim and option uptake is going to look like on the Model 3 justto give folks an idea on what the pricing and margin profile might look like.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI mean, it's really guesswork at this point. But if it were to be comparable to what we see with, say,Model S or with other vehicles in the market. It's something like a 20% to 30% increment over the[indiscernible] would be the typical average. Jon, do you have any...Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceYes, I think that's right. And that's -- we experience a little bit higher than that in Model S. And ModelS in comparison to Model 3 has more range, has more power, has more cargo, et cetera. And we'll beintroducing at the start of production, I think we'll be announcing our vehicle -- as we get closer to thestart of production what these vehicle stacks will be, but I think 20% is a fair number to use.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, actually, just to reemphasize that, I might repeat this a few times on the call. We want to be superclear that Model 3 is not version 3 of our car. The Model 3 is essentially a smaller, more affordableversion of the Model S with fewer features. But the Model S and the Model 3 will be at the same level oftechnology. And if you were to -- if you were to put a version on, say, what -- I would say probably onversion 4 of Model S, and Model 3 will also be version 4. If you make it like the essentially a first -- whenModel S first came out, it was rear-wheel drive. And then we had Dual Motor all-wheel drive, we had initialHardware 1 Autopilot and then Hardware 2 Autopilot, and there was a facial refresh. There have beenroughly 4 versions of Model S, and we're on the fourth version. Model 3 will also be version 4. It's a littleconfusing because one's a letter and the other's a number. And Model 3 was supposed to be called theModel E, but then Ford threatened to sue us. And then I thought we're being all clever by calling it theModel 3, but actually the joke's on me because it caused confusion in the marketplace. So we're doingour best to clear up that confusion so people do not think that Model 3 is somehow superior to Model S.Actually, Model S will be better than Model 3 as it should be because it's a more expensive car. We're goingto be -- sound like a broken record on this front, and the messaging might get a little annoying, but wereally have to be emphatic to clear up an error, which I think is my responsibility, in naming somethingthat inherently would cause confusion with marketing."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionI was wondering if you could maybe give us an update qualitatively or quantitatively on how investorsshould think about battery costs. I think your last public statement was that Tesla's battery cost earlylast year was under $190 per kilowatt hour. If we look at how Powerwall 2, there's been significantimprovement in cost per kilowatt and in density. But I think if we try and do the math on Powerwall 2,we'd still come up with a number that's reasonably high. So maybe can help us -- I think in the past, Elon,you've said that you hope to get to $100 per kilowatt hour by 2020. And I recognize that's aspirational.But maybe you can help us a little bit frame how we should think about battery cost today, what kind ofimprovement you're seeing from -- or expect to see with 2170 batteries in vehicles going forward.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI mean, regarding numbers for cost [indiscernible] [ are close how competitive ] is the informationexcept that we do expect to see significant improvements year-over-year as much as improving the corechemistry of the cell, reducing essentially the cell mass that is inactive and, of course, mass economiesof scale and vertical integration at the Gigafactory. These will all take time to bear fruit, but there will besignificant time. With the Powerwall, the -- there are a bunch of other costs in the Powerwall that are morethan just the battery cost. So you've got the -- you have the cell cost, and you have -- and you get thecell into a module, you've got all the cooling systems, the control systems, the safety stuff that prevents arunaway, the enclosure, the modem to communicate to the Internet and then [indiscernible] would be thepower electronics to take the power from the cells and eventually convert that to the AC or DC power ofthe house keys. J.B., is there something you'd like to add to that?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerNo. That's a great description. It's a fully integrated product. It's a system, not just a bunch of cells. Sowhen you -- if you're maybe trying to calculate dollar per kilowatt or the cost of the Powerwall, I thinkyou'd find it's extremely competitive against other home energy storage systems. We believe the best. Butthere is a lot of other hardware in there that's all included, all wrapped together in the Powerwall price, soyou don't have to piecemeal the system in your house.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight. But we're quite confident that the Powerwall is the highest quality product and actually at the lowestcost of anything in the market. So that is a good product. And I feel good, feel pretty happy with it.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerAnd some of the improvement trajectory that you saw from Powerwall 1 to Powerwall 2, part of that ismade possible by the migration to 2170 cells made at Gigafactory, not all of it but a large part of it. Sothat is something we're pleased with and feel it's going well.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionOkay. I was wondering also your customer deposits, and I recognize there's a lot in that, declined forthe second straight quarter. And at least by my math, it appears as though Tesla's new car inventoryhas increased substantially over the last couple of quarters, maybe 3,500 units or about 50%, eventhough sort of production and deliveries have been relatively constant. I'm wondering if you are seeingincremental demand pressure on Model X. And particularly Model S, Elon, you underscored that therewas confusion in the marketplace. And are these the metrics that are suggesting to you that there's someconfusion in the marketplace? Are you seeing cancellations? Because at least optically, it looks like thebook-to-bill is less than 1 on S and X.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. Deepak here, a couple of questions that you had. Firstly, just to clarify, [indiscernible] weeklyinventory [indiscernible] very slightly from end of Q4 to end of Q1. And the -- and we are using someof that in different ways, and Jon can explain that further. And also to your other question on customerdeposits, what I'm seeing is that we had an artificial backlog in our customer deposits of Model Xs. And asour production of Model Xs has stabilized and as our mix of Model S has increased relative to X, we havecleared that. So it's nothing unusual from what I'm seeing there. And Jon, do you want to add on the...Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceThat's right. The increase in inventories is about split in 2. One is we increased Model X test drive vehiclesby about 1,000 over the past quarter. We had prioritized deliveries as we ramped up Model X productionand prioritized getting cars to customers first and to our store second. Our stores have finally gotten theirtest drive fleets, and that's what you see in terms of the half of the unit volume increase. The secondhalf is in our service loaners. So as our installed fleet has gone up, we need -- we wanted to make surethat our owners were getting a service loaner, and we'll continually increase that, and you'll see that overtime. That's not a one-time event. You'll see as we continue to deliver this level of cars per quarter thatwe will increase the service loaner fleet proportionally so that we've got the ability to offer a Tesla to ourcustomers.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. And in fact, this'll take us a few months to fully deploy, but our policy for service loaners is that theservice loaner fleet will be the very best version of a Tesla that is available. So if you have a Model Xthat comes in for service, the service loaner you will get will be the absolute fully loaded state-of-the-artP100D Ludicrous, best Model X that we have. The same for the Model S. So it will be the kind of thingwhere you hope that service takes a long time because you have the absolute top-of-the-line Tesla as aservice loaner.A.M. SacconaghiSanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research DivisionSo Elon, just to clarify, the confusion that you believe exists between potentially Model 3 and Model S,that's not being inferred from order patterns? That's being inferred more qualitatively from what you'relearning in showrooms? Or how do you make that assessment of the problem?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThere are no -- we have seen some impact of Model S orders as a function of people being confusedthat Model 3 is the upgrade to Model S. Now we took action to correct that about a month ago, but thatmessage has not filtered down to all of our customers. So there's still a lot of people who are under theimpression that Model 3 is the upgrade from Model S. But in fact, the one upgrade is just by the latestModel S. That's the actual upgrade. Not -- like saying -- thinking that the upgrade path from an Audi A6is an Audi A4. It's not. So yes, so it's just a question of correcting that misconception, which I'm confidentwe'll be able to do in the next several weeks."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Colin Langan with UBS.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionYou've talked about in the past reinventing the machine that makes the machine. And now that we'regetting a little bit closer to the Model 3 launch, any additional color on what steps in automation you'redoing for the Model 3? And any rough order of magnitude of how much more automated the Model 3would be versus the traditional production line?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. So with Model 3, I think would be roughly comparable with the best high-volume vehicle productionlines in the world, better in some respects, a little worse than others, but roughly comparable. And thenwith some further iteration, I think it will probably be a little bit better than the next-best automotiveproduction line. Then where things will really be a step change I think beyond any other automatedactually will be the Model Y factory. And this is both a function of designing the product to be easy tomanufacture and easy to automate as well as designing the factory itself. So Model Y is where I think itreally becomes a step change, but Model 3 is going to be at or probably slightly better than I think thenext best automotive [indiscernible], that's pretty [indiscernible]. And then Model Y will be -- there'll benothing close to it, I think.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerMaybe just to add as a relative benchmark, against the S and the X, the Model 3 is vastly moreautomated. And perhaps it's not the best benchmark for you looking forward, it's perhaps 3 to 4x moreautomated than an S or an X, and much more simpler to build.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIs that 1/5 of the hours per car?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSo. It's 5x the volume, but the same hours per car.Colin LanganUBS Investment Bank, Research DivisionGot it. And as a follow-up, any color on -- you've announce the doubling of the Supercharger network andincreasing your dealers. I mean, how should we think about that over the next few years? Is that doublinggoing to be enough? Or how do you see the network needing to expand going forward?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, it's exciting that Supercharger network substantially hit that number just recently, and you can seethe growth plan on our website. That's going to continue to increase dramatically. Jon, do you want tospeak to service?Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceYes. Service locations are what you see increasing in the shareholder letter. But you should probablythink about service capacity in 2 ways now. One of the things we've discovered as we've deployed moreadvanced service techniques into our centers is that a super majority of the cars that we repair don'trequire a lift. That frees us from brick-and-mortar service. And we've added substantially now to ourmobile service capability starting first experimenting in the Bay Area and in some of our major markets,and we'll be rolling that out throughout the year. And so we're creating service capacity in 2 ways --mobile service and fixed service operations. But fixed service operations are becoming much, much moreefficient.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderMuch higher throughput.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceAbsolutely, much higher throughput per worker, more throughput per square foot across really everymetric."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionElon, first question's is on CFIUS and Tencent. So after acquiring this 5% passive stake in the company,I'm thinking given the highly sensitive nature of your proprietary tech and computer vision, AI, robotics, etcetera, and all the related infrastructure, I would imagine that the Commission for Foreign Investment inthe United States and the Pentagon might be concerned at the idea of a Chinese or a potentially Chinesestate-backed company going any further than a small passive stake. Am I watching too many Cold Warmovies here? Or is there potential for some sensitivity on the grounds of national security?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, I think 5% is not that big of a deal. I mean they're not present at board meetings. They don't haveany insight into Tesla that's not public.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes. As Elon said, this is a passive investment. And it doesn't require CFIUS clearance from that point ofview. Again, they don't have any access to confidential information or board materials, so it's just a beliefand the support of what they think Tesla can achieve.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionOkay. And just as a follow-up, Apple has enough net cash, I think, to buy Tesla like more than 3x over.Is there anything that Apple does or has, besides having more money than they know what to do with,that could be helpful in Tesla's mission to accelerate the transition to shared autonomy in sustainabletransport? Could they be the type of firm you could partner with? And could you -- is this something youcould talk to Tim about?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I don't think they want to have that conversation. I don't believe -- there's not been any indicationthat they do. But obviously, Apple's company makes some great product. And yes, I mean, I use theirphone and their laptop, it's cool.Adam Michael JonasMorgan Stanley, Research DivisionI mean, do you think of them more a competitor than potential partner? Is that unfair?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI mean, I don't know what they're going to do on the car front. Yes, it's not clear."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Tyler Frank with Robert Baird.Tyler Charles FrankRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionCan you walk me through what your capital needs are for the Model 3 just to get to production and thento ramp production throughout this year and next year? And then how confident are you that you mightbe able to hit that 100,000-unit production target for the Model 3 in this year? And then I have a follow-upafter that.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerI don't think we have indicated the -- we have just said in the letter, we'll achieve 5,000 per week at somepoint this year and 10,000 at some point next year. So we haven't clarified on that. So...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. The trick with the -- when you've got a whole new product and a whole new factory is I don't predictexactly what the -- what that initial S-curve look -- initial push in the S-curve looks like, it's extremelydifficult. In every way, the production starts off slowly and then you gradually eliminate the constraintsand eventually it starts taking off exponentially. But because of that sort of initial slow ramp that thengoes exponentially -- it's more changed in where that lands in the quarter, it can have quite a big impacton total volume. It's a lot easier to predict where the upper flat portion of the S-curve is likely to be, butpredicting the rapidly changing portion of the S-curve is just, I think, not within the ability of anyone topredict with accuracy.Tyler Charles FrankRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionGot it. And then can you just run us through what the capital needs are sort of to hit that 10,000-unit perweek goal as well as where the battery factory stands in terms of its current capacity versus its expectedtotal capacity and what time line is to get to that total capacity mark?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerWell, we feel pretty good overall about the capital needs and our ability to fund that to achieve that10,000 per week capacity and...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWith internal...Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, with internal -- right, exactly, with our own resources and the cash that we generate from ourbusiness as we ramp up Model 3 volumes. And overall, and J.B. can speak up more to that in terms of thecell capacity, that's all lined up to come in -- come online just ahead of our needs on the vehicle side aswell as on the energy storage side.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerAnd we initially forecast about 35 gigawatt hours of cell capacity and 50 gigawatt hours of pack capacity,and we anticipate to surpass that cell capacity in 2018. So that's going well. And with the increasingimprovements in the production density and speed at the Gigafactory, we actually ultimately believe, andI think we've said this before, that we can fit substantially more capacity than the 35 gigawatt hours atGigafactory 1. So...Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. And we've said publicly that we think cell capacity at Gigafactory 1 is likely to exceed 100 gigawatthours over time.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerSo the end stage of 35 is really sort of a passing point at this stage and will continue on from there.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, yes.Tyler Charles FrankRobert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research DivisionRight. Okay. And then Elon, you had previously pulled out a target of 1 million cars per year by 2020. Doyou still think that's achievable? And what needs to take place in order to get there?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, I do. I think we need to come up with the Model Y sometime in 2020 or, aspirationally, late 2019. Andthen I think that 1 million units is quite likely -- combined, yes. Maybe more."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionI wanted to first just ask about the order rate for the S and the X in the quarter and also get some coloraround your deliveries from a regional perspective. I believe there was an expiration of an electric vehicletax credit in Hong Kong. I'm just wondering if that created any pull forward or incremental demand inthe quarter and if there's any air pocket to orders and deliveries for the second quarter, seeing that youmaintained your 47,000 to 50,000 1H delivery guidance.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. I mean, there was some pull forward demand in Hong Kong, that's 1 city on earth. So the[indiscernible] impact our ability to achieve our delivery target for Q2.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionAnd the order rate growth for the quarter?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, the -- I think we feel pretty good about achieving the sort of the 100k, roughly 100k, total for theyear for S and X, combined. That's where we kind of want to be. The manufacturing system at the supplychain is all sort of set up for that level. We continue to be surprised by how sort of, frankly, naive peopleare -- a lot of you are about production and supply chain. It's as though -- it sounds like an easy way toincrease production, it's truly not. You can't -- at any given production system, you design it for optimaloutput and then you aim to improve efficiency, reliability, quality and so forth at that output. So the S andX system, as I said last year, was designed for 100,000 units. And initially to get to that rate, we have touse a lot of overtime, a lot of expediting, and that affected our gross margin on the car. And now we'resort of at steady-state with the kind of the top part of that S-curve that we're targeting. And so now ourfocus for S and X is improving production efficiency, continuing to improve quality and...Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerMaterial cost.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, material cost and so forth, to sort of -- and to get the right amount of gross margin for S and X to goto the 30% level that we've been aspiring to for a while.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionUnderstood, that's on the production side. My question was just on the what the order rates and demandwas looking like from what you're seeing on your customer base. Historically, you've given or provided avery helpful color on what the year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter order growth rate has been on the Sand the X, and I think it's a meaningful metric for what demand looks like for those vehicles and for yourproducts. But that's okay, understood.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI don't think it's meaningful. We're going to produce 100,000 units approximately, so all that matters isthere's demand. Is there going to be demand for 100,000 units? I believe there will be. And there is.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd there certainly sufficient demand for the guidance we've given for the first half.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionUnderstood. And just on the SolarCity side, it looked like a pretty good gross margin quarter. I wanted tounderstand how much of that was from the shift further into the cash loan versus the PPA lease? And howmuch was that? Or was it more associated with the ramping of the Gigafactory and production of the cells?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerIt was primarily seasonality. We had [indiscernible] production happen in the Northern Hemisphere insome of the PPA leases and how we recognize revenue. And also it was we had some $14 million sale ofenergy credits that helped us. And the credit sale is a sale that happen every quarter, but we have the fullquarter of it, which we didn't have in our half quarter of SolarCity sales -- financials in our Tesla incomestatement.Lyndon R. RiveCo-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerAnd plus, we've seen an increase in cash and earnings that improved the margin as well.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, that does help the margin as well, yes.David J. TamberrinoGoldman Sachs Group Inc., Research DivisionI'm sorry to ask one more but that was a bit inaudible. Could you repeat that, Lyndon?Lyndon R. RiveCo-Founder and Chief Executive OfficerYes, we've actually seen an increase in the Tesla line business.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWe're going to get the majority of the cash and loan by the end of the year.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerCorrect.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSo just to be clear, for [indiscernible] activity, we'd like it to get to the majority of the cash and loan by theend of the year.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd we expect the Solar margins to stay very healthy for the rest of the year and grow over time."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Martin Viecha with Redburn.Martin ViechaRedburn (Europe) Limited, Research DivisionThis is Martin from Redburn. I wanted to ask about the pep talk that you had a few days ago, where youtalked about level 5 maybe in the next 2 years. And I was wondering that it's probably going to changeradically the design of the car inside and whether you foresee this in the next 2 years that the interiordesign would change quite dramatically.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI don't think the -- we're going to see a dramatic change in interior design. There may be an option whereyou have club seating instead of everyone facing forward, but I wouldn't call that radical, just turningseats around. And I'm not sure how much people obviously would want to do that. I mean, the sensorhardware and compute power required for at least to have a 4 to a level 5 autonomy has been in everyTesla producer since October of last year approximately. So it's a matter of upgrading the software andlooking to level 5. And if it does turn out that we need to upgrade the compute power, it's designed to beeasy to upgrade, basically access through the glove box and plug in a more powerful computer. So wedon't think it will be but if it is, that's pretty easy to do. So the important thing to appreciate is that thesensor hardware and wiring harnesses necessary for autonomy which is essentially having the 8 cameras,the radar and ultrasonics, that's in place. So that with each passing release, the car's autonomy levelwill improve. We had a bit of a dip, obviously, because of the unexpectedly rapid transition away fromMobileye, where we'd expected to have the Mobileye chip on the board as we transitioned but Mobileyerefused to allow that. So then we had to basically recreate all the Mobileye functionality in about 6 monthswhich we did.Martin ViechaRedburn (Europe) Limited, Research DivisionOkay. And then the other follow-up question that I had was on the Model Y. You mentioned that the Model3 production line will be probably as fast or a bit faster than the fastest production line in the world, andModel Y will be the genuine step change. Does that mean that the Model Y will be made on a differentplatform than the Model 3?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderIt will be, yes, different platform. Just one example, but the wiring harness on Model S is about 3kilometers in length. The wiring harness on Model 3 is 1.5 kilometers in length. The wiring harness onModel Y will be 100 meters. And that's a redundant wiring harness. So really, wiring harness is basically aflex harness with a high bit rate bus, so you can put everything on a higher bit rate bus that doesn't -- aCAN bus where you -- your data rate isn't necessarily constrained. And we will also have make changes tothe vestigial voltage, so that not everything is 12 volts, which is a pretty absurd number, really, it's wrongfor everything."

A housekeeping one and then sort of kind of where are you kind of aquestion for Elon. On the housekeeping, your order delivery announcements at the end of the quarter, youused to make delivery announcements -- you used to talk about deliveries to end customers. This quarter,it was just deliveries to customers. Is there any change in distribution channel, potentially using resellersin some markets that that's meant to communicate?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerNo. It is the same thing. It's consistent. We are delivering to individual customers.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. Second, a couple of years ago, when the stock was at $200, in an answer to one of my questions,Elon, you outlined a scenario where you could get to $700 billion in market cap, that's about where Applewas at the time. We're 2 years later, you're obviously close to the Model 3 launch. How are you looking atthat?Elon R.

And anything else in terms of other businesses or volume or still pretty much on that track?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThe set of steps necessary to achieve that outcome seems pretty obvious and heavily involve Tesla gettingincredibly good at the machine that builds the machine -- which involves, by the way, a tremendousamount of software. This is -- it's not just a bunch of robots sort of sitting there, it's the programming ofthe robots and how they interact. And it's far more complex than the software in the car. I mean, I thinkthis is just going to be a very difficult thing for other manufacturers to copy. I probably wouldn't knowwhat to do if I were in that position.Brian Arthur JohnsonBarclays PLC, Research DivisionOkay. And just one quick question: Why pick-up trucks? Why semis before pick-up trucks?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, they're not going to be that widely separated in time. And part of it is we do want to show thatelectric transport can do even the most heavy-duty things in the world. So it's -- I think it's pretty obviousthat we can do a pick-up truck. But it's not obvious to a lot of people that we can do a heavy-duty semi.And so just being able to kind of hit the corners of the box of capability. It's a helpful thing to do. Yes.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerMaybe I'll add a point. But a disproportionate amount of petroleum is actually burned by a small numberof trucks just because of the high utilization, the high miles per vehicle, and it really lends itself, I think,well to electrification.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, exactly. Every semi -- I mean, there's probably 10x as much [ hydrocondensate ] for a semi as for apickup truck."

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionA couple remaining questions. Just one is, since the Model 3 is maybe 2 or 3 months away, could youjust give us a sense of what some of the most critical outstanding items are that are going to gate thecommercial launch timing? And now that there are actual physical test vehicles on the road, are there anysignificant changes happening?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, actually it seems to be -- we're not really seeing any significant change that needs to occur withModel 3. So it's coming in as expected, as the design continuation has predicted, it's getting pretty closeto the bull's-eye, and I'm not aware of anything that would affect our prior statements about volumetarget.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionSo there's nothing outstanding vis-\u00e0-vis tooling, deliveries or things like that, that you're still viewing as acritical item with some uncertainty?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThere's plenty of things with uncertainty, but I don't know anything that would prevent us from startingfirstly in July, and exceeding 5,000 units per week by the end of the year. There may be some cost upthere, I just don't know of what that is today.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionGot it. Just switching gears to China. Obviously, domestic production is presumably very important to yoursuccess in that region. China recently suggested that they may relax the rules for foreign ownership orthat they intend to relax the rules for foreign ownership. And I was wondering if you could just update uson where you stand vis-\u00e0-vis the growth plans there? And are the rules for ownership, is that one of thegating factors?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI don't think this is quite the right timing to make any announcements on that front. But I would expect usto define our plans more clearly by the middle of year with respect to China production. I would -- I thinkit's good timing that -- I mean the China rule changes are good timing.Rod Avraham LacheDeutsche Bank AG, Research DivisionGot it. And just lastly, unless there's a pretty huge Q2 for CapEx, it appears that you're tracking at lessthan that $2 billion number that you had articulated of capital spending prelaunch of Model 3. Is that afunction of savings, contractual timing or is that capacity issue? Just some thoughts on how we should bethinking about the capital spending relative to your prior targets.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerYes, it's not too far from it, Rod, and we are -- we have significant CapEx in Q2, and it's done in a biglump sum or a little big peak given how much equipment is being installed and then tested. Often, ourCapEx payments happen -- and a big chunk of the funding payments happen after the equipment isinstalled, it's tested and then we have fairly good customer payment terms. In many cases, it's 90 days.And so it's just a matter of that process and timing and saying that we feel very comfortable in terms ofhow that is happening, the spend and the installation, and we're all getting this for Model 3.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI mean, if anyone comes on a tour of the factory, it's really insane how much equipment is arriving andgetting installed and being brought online, it's really -- and I'm used to seeing a lot of intense equipment.It blows my mind. Like, wow. And I think you'd also get kind of a visual sense for the improvement inmanufacturing technology between S and X and 3. So you just go, and look at it, it's like yup, that'sobviously better."

BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionWhat do you think are likely to prove the biggest challenges or bottlenecks in ramping production to 5,000vehicles per week by some point in 2017? And how confident are you in your ability to overcome thosechallenges? And then the shareholder letter also mentions a run rate of I think 10,000 or approaching10,000 per week in 2018, which would maybe seem to indicate some kind of an annual run rate of500,000 or so Model 3s. And then given you're also tracking kind of 100,000 Ss and Xs. Do think that typeof production can be handled out of the Fremont facility or does your plan assume production in anotherfacility as well?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. The -- yes, all of that production is intended to be out of the Gigafactory 1 and Fremont. So yes,we believe that can all be handled here. And far as specific constraints on Model 3, I just don't know ofanything that really stands out. We've gone to great pains with the Model 3 to design it for manufacturingand to not have all sorts of bells and whistles and special features that, like, for example, like, with X.X became kind of like a technology bandwagon of every cool thing you can imagine all at once. It's likeeverything all at once. That was a terrible strategy. You really want to start off simple and add things overtime. But that was some hubris and real overconfident there. So with Model 3 it's the opposite. We'vedesigned it to be easy to make. We've got I think a much better supply chain in place where we've got theA team from the A suppliers. We didn't have that for the Model X or the S. And as far as we know, thereare no issues. So that strategy appears to be paying off but there could be something that we've missedthat we just don't know about right now.Ryan J. BrinkmanJP Morgan Chase & Co, Research DivisionOkay. And you mentioned production in the Gigafactory. I know you're doing some component assemblythere for the Model 3. But given that it is on track to be the world's largest factory or maybe even theworld's largest building, is it such a stretch to think that you might be able to produce vehicles in thatfacility?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderLook, just in terms of making battery cells, modules, packs, motors and power-tronics, just on that basis-- and, of course, the Powerwall, the Powerpack. On that basis alone it is effectively the largest buildingin the world of any kind. I mean, you could fit 3 Pentagons, more than 3 Pentagons in the building.4 Pentagons? I don't know, a lot.

I mean, you guys did kind of fade down your expectationfor CapEx ahead of -- or in conjunction with a Model 3 launch from $2 billion to $2.5 billion to $2 billionand then the spend this quarter was relatively low, at least relative to what the run rate implied. I'm justcurious, is there some level of capital efficiency that you're coming across? And I mean, and could you bepossibly be significantly below this $2 billion number ahead of the launch or into the launch?Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerWe're always trying to be capital efficient. That is the underlying theme of every step we take. And clearly,some of that is part of it. But I think overall would be -- again, because of this massive scale of payments,whether it's last week of June or first week of July, how many [indiscernible] we end up paying, it's hard tobe precise. It's almost like an S-curve of capital spend that we're going through here. So I don't think it'sany indication of anything else except timing at the highest level -- beyond the capital efficiency that weare continually working on.John Joseph MurphyBofA Merrill Lynch, Research DivisionOkay. And then a second question, I mean, residuals seem to keep performing better than you wereexpecting. Is there any opportunity to potentially lower monthly lease payments to drive higher unitvolume demand going forward?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderActually, I think one of the traps that the auto industry has gotten into, into the past is having unrealisticresiduals and then finding that they're upside-down typically when a recession came along. We want to bevery cautious about falling into that trap. So yes, we're -- yes, we don't want to do that. And sort of really,an advantage that our cars have that cars in the past have not had, no other car has, is that the softwarekeeps getting better. So functionality, we keep adding more and more functionality to the car even thoughthe hardware stayed the same. If the model S -- if you bought a Model S 4 years ago, it's way better thanwhen you brought it and that really makes a difference for residuals."

And given your partnershipsin the past, would you envision partnering with a manufacturer on that side of the business? Or would thisbe more akin to your sort of go it alone strategy on the auto side?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWe'll manufacture that ourselves. And most of that semi is actually made out of Model 3 parts, by theway. It's Model 3 -- it's actually using a bunch of Model 3 motors. Probably revealing too much aboutthe future of it. But so we're able to use a very high volume vehicle and then combine several motors tohave something that I think is actually going to have a very good gross margin, like it's -- that's just notsomething that any other -- it's like you can't do that with a traditional truck. So effectively it allows us tohave a very compelling product that has a low unit cost.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, the incremental complexity of building that is much less than it might seem.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, exactly.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerIn terms of all the [indiscernible]Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, exactly.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCAnd are we right to think about that though, as a contractual sort of opportunity, right? I mean, you go tosort of a handful of fleet operators and you could sell sort of more vehicles per customer. Is that the rightway to think about it?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderThat is how it would occur, yes. So it's essentially much more of a straightforward economic decision forthe operators. They just look at it as a cost per ton per mile [ economy ]. And it's like if it's better, they'lljust buy a huge number. And if it's worse, they won't buy hardly any. And we're confident it'll be better.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCOkay. Great. And then if I just may follow-up on the demand questions that were sort of asked earlier.Wondering as you're getting more used vehicles back into the pipeline, is there any data to support thatyou're using those vehicles to attract a potentially new customer to the brand? Or alternatively, is theredata that would suggest that perhaps could be cannibalizing some of the newer vehicles? But sorry todwell on demand, but I just wanted to see if there was anything, given now we're a few years on, andyou're getting a lot of vehicles back off-lease presumably, if there's any indication there one way or theother.Jonathan McNeillPresident of Global Sales & ServiceI think it's still early days, they're still at relatively low numbers. But the indication is that we'reintroducing a new customer to Tesla at those lower price points.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, exactly. The demand actually increases really exponentially as price drops. The -- at one point whenwe looked at it, I think we were looking at the right number, but the demand at the Model 3 price pointappeared to be somewhere between 30x and 70x higher than at the Model S price point. Well, I mean,you look at it like, so there's 100,000 premium sedans sold in the U.S. every year. I think we're about 1/3of that. But there are 17 million vehicles in total sold, so premium sedans are like nothing. Less than 1%of the market. 0.5%.James Joseph AlbertineConsumer Edge Research, LLCSo a 7 Series customer for -- your brand new and a 5 series customer for your sort of used, is maybe theright way to think about it? Is that fair?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerOr a 3 series customer for the used as well. Yes.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderBut it is interesting to consider that the magnitude of -- this is really maybe underappreciated. Likeconsider 17 million cars and trucks sold in the U.S. per year. Of which only 100,000 are premium sedans.And we have a 1/3 market share. If we can replicate that in other segments, the results are obvious.Jeff EvansonVice President of Investor RelationsOkay. Before we go on to the next question, I want to do just a time check here.

One, Elon, at the TED Talks, and I think a couple tweets, you had talked about adding3 Gigafactories, just following up to Tyler Frank's question on CapEx needs. Can you just talk aboutwhat your ultimate vision of Tesla over the next few years? Model Y factory, truck factories, truck servicecenters, 3 Gigafactories, China schedule, is all of that going to be funded with internal cash? Or do you seepartnerships funding, despite the low margins that the battery industry has? I'm just trying to get a senseof what your ultimate vision will cost.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderRight. Incremental dilution along the way. It's hard to say. I mean, I'm sure there will be some fundingrounds that happen in the future. It's kind of a trade-off between how fast do we want to grow versus-- like, we can grow slower with no dilution, really. For sure, we could grow at a moderate pace with nodilution. We could grow at a fast pace with some dilution. Or we can grow at a very fast pace with a highlevel of dilution.Jeffrey David OsborneCowen and Company, LLC, Research Division10x growth in 3 years sounds pretty fast me but maybe not to you.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderWell, yes, but you have to look and say going from -- when we went from the Roadster to the Model S,we went from making around 500 units a year to making 20,000 units a year. So that's a hell of a goodgrowth, up by a factor of 40.Jeffrey David OsborneCowen and Company, LLC, Research DivisionGot it. Maybe just out of the interest of time, the second question I had is just on -- it would be helpfulgiven that there's hundreds of thousands of people that have put a deposit on the Model 3, can you justupdate us on what the cumulative U.S. vehicles sold that you have relative to 200,000 number to get that$7,500 tax credit? You mentioned elasticity of demand at certain price points, but certainly there's a largecontingent of people that put a deposit that unfortunately won't get the benefit. So it would be nice justto be able to track that metric, so as the 3 launches in the coming months we can see which folks will getthat. And what the impact of demand is for those that don't.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderI think most people are going to be able to get it that have put down a deposit. And it's just -- it's aphysical problem. Yes. It's sort of the credit rolls off. It just -- it's not like a complete close. It rolls off overtime. And we are prioritizing U.S. production, which also helps us with keeping things simple so there's-- we're not making many versions of the car for many different countries. Yes, and so I mean, I thinkprovided somebody is -- I don't know. My guess is probably most people that have put down a deposit willbe able to get the full tax credit.Jeffrey David OsborneCowen and Company, LLC, Research DivisionIs there a way you could just give us what the cumulative numbers so far in the U.S. quarter to date -- orsorry, inception to date?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderNo. Here's the problem. If we do that, then people run off and make all sorts of conclusions based onthat, that really have -- that are not predictive of the future. Because there are no -- you can't test drive aModel 3. If you come into our stores and you want to buy a Model 3, we try to get you to buy a Model S orX instead. We anti-sell the Model 3. But I mean, that's -- reservations continue to climb week after week.No advertising, anti-selling, nothing to test drive, still grows every week.Deepak AhujaChief Financial OfficerAnd maybe we'll try clarifying that under the present regime, the income -- the tax credits on the carcontinue even after we hit the 200,000 limit, and they continue to sell in quarters but at a slightly lowerdepleting scale. So it's going to be beneficial for customers even beyond the 200,000 mark.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes, absolutely. And I should perhaps touch again on this whole notion of -- like, [ ODS ] has done allthese sort of entertaining articles, like Tesla survived because of, like, government subsidies and taxcredits, drives me crazy. Here's what those fools don't realize. If Tesla is not alone in the car industry that-- all those things would be material if we were the only car company in existence. We are not. There aremany car companies. What matters is whether we have a relative advantage in the market. And in fact,the incentives give us a relative disadvantage. This is [indiscernible] in spite of the incentives, not becauseof them. And -- but these incentives have limited lifetime and they're limited scale -- like, for example,the federal tax credit. And then the -- that caps out at the 200k. The carb credits, which the carb rules arewoefully weak. We can sell -- there are some quarters where we can't even sell carb credits. And whenwe can, it's maybe $0.50 on the dollar, or something like that. Whereas the other car companies get tofully absorb the value of the carb credit. So, for example, gives GM roughly -- I count a $7,000 to $10,000advantage over Tesla for the Chevy Volt. That's why like [indiscernible] well, GM appears to be losing$10,000 a car on the Volt. No, they're not. They're making it up in carb credits. But they get the full retailvalue of the carb credit whereas we get the wholesale value when we're lucky. But the carb credits only --are only effective at a production rate of about 20,000 to 30,000 vehicles a year. So that's why you'll see,mark my words, it's not going to be any higher than that for the Chevy Volt. That's the 25,000 -- on theorder of 25,000 units a year or 1/10th of our initial production rate for the Model 3 or 1/20th of what theModel 3 will be next year. So Tesla's competitive advantage improves as the incentives go away. This is --it continues to be something that is not well understood. And for that they don't -- I'll also mention that --the Nevada tax credits, which for the Gigafactory, it makes it sound like we got a $1.3 billion check fromthe state of Nevada. We did not. Those tax credits are made up -- the vast majority of it is just sales anduse tax abatement on equipment in the Gigafactory. Taxes that otherwise wouldn't been there becausethere was just a bunch of rocks there before. And you don't get a lot of taxes from rocks. So that's whyit is essentially a no-lose proposition for the state. And in order for us to actually earn $1.3 billion in taxcredits for the Gigafactory we have to generate, over the course of 20 years, about $100 billion in outputfrom the Gigafactory. So yes, it's worth about like 1%. And don't want to look a gift horse in the mouthand we appreciate it and that's nice. But this is obviously -- 1% is not the difference between success andfailure for the factory. And -- but a lot of articles write it in the past tense, \"Tesla received $1.3 billion.\"No, we haven't. We did not receive that. It's only 1% of that, great, we'll take it. But I -- looking at thebank now, I just don't see it there. That's because it's just sales and use tax abatement over 20 years. Butthe key takeaway is that as Tesla's competitive advantage improves with scale, it doesn't get worse."

By our math, if you look at the cumulative number of vehicles you'vedelivered and the amount of stores and service stations, it's a little bit over -- or something around 700per I guess station. And I realize you're adding some more of these mobile units. But I just wanted toknow bigger picture how you think about coverage in the more steady state or at least at 0.5 million unitrate. Like, what is the right level of coverage needed for the larger fleet?Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerI think, rather than thinking about store or service center locations, we think about it in terms of mobileunits and lifts. And so we are building larger service centers over time that have more lifts. So our initialservice centers, it might have had 2 or 3 lifts. And we're building now service centers with 40 to 60,sometimes 80 lifts. And so there's a density within the service centers. But the mobile capability expandsthat quite greatly. So I think a lot of people do incorrect analysis to take cars in service divided bylocations, because the locations varies so widely. But that's essentially how we're thinking about capacityand planning capacity. And as Deepak mentioned earlier, our throughputs and efficiency are getting muchbetter over time, and we'll continue to improve those. So it's our goal to stay ahead of the installed basecapacity so we're providing great service. But really the Model 3 has been designed for high reliability.

        "paragraph": "Our next question comes from Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners.Robert George CihraGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research DivisionTwo quick questions I guess if I could. One just on energy, your megawatt hours declined sequentially,which just seemed surprising thinking demand is well above supply still at this stage. So when we couldexpect any more meaningful ramp there? And then separately, on automotive, given that you seem tobe in the mood to talk about future unveils, which is great, any chance I could push that by asking aboutthe future urban transport bus? Not sure what you want to refer to it as. But the reason I ask is not -- isbecause that one seems a lot less about the product and more about just a completely different model fortransportation and requiring full autonomy and that sort of thing. I mean, is that the kind of thing you'rethinking 3 years now or 10 years now or anything in between?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderSure. With respect to the battery stuff, it's a little lumpy right now because you're at a big installation infourth quarter with Southern California Edison. And then we had a bit of a gap between the Powerwall 1 toPowerwall 2. So we should start to see that correcting in Q2 and Q3 and then particularly towards the endof this year, I would expect quite a dramatic ramp in storage deployment, like really dramatic.Jeffrey B. StraubelChief Technology OfficerYes, and it's worth pointing out that we do still have a significant backlog in Powerwall demand and thenwe're building capacity to address that and ramping it. We had a few challenges in parts of the supplychain as we've been ramping that throughout the quarter, the first quarter. But those are freeing up. Andwe're seeing the production rates improve week-on-week. But it's a -- yes, it's not indicative of demand.It's really our challenges of ramping the new products.Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderYes. Like I say I feel really good about quite dramatic quarter-over-quarter increases. I think with -- well,for every quarter I can imagine the future, it's going to be really dramatic increases in stationary storageoutput. It will grow faster than the car volume, and the car volume is growing pretty fast.Robert George CihraGuggenheim Securities, LLC, Research DivisionOkay, and the bus?Elon R. MuskCEO, Product Architect, Chairman & Co-FounderOn the bus, yes. Having given a bit more thought to it, I don't know if the bus thing -- if that's actuallygoing to be something that makes sense in the shared, fully autonomous environment. Because it may-- if you have a share -- if it costs like very little, like it costs less than a bus ticket to have -- make useof a shared autonomy fleet to go wherever you want to point to point. Well, why wouldn't you just usethat? So I don't know. I don't know if the bus thing -- it does helps with density to some degree. But thenyou -- I mean you could basically have something like a higher density Model X or something like that,that's got 10 or 12 seats in it. But would you want more than that? I don't know. And then when youfactor tunnels in -- big round tunnels anyway -- yes, then the density -- urban density in traffic, and itcan be fully alleviated with tunnels.
